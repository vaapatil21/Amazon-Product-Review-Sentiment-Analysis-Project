I shoot with a D700 right now and I sold my D90 just to buy this one, I was happy with the d90 but i wanted more ISO capabilities since i often shoot in clubs, weddings etc lots of low light situations. even thou is gonna be my back up camera for shows, it is going to be my main body for when i shoot and video at home my kids and such, so i wanted to make sure it was better than the D90, and so far it is.
i shot at 6400 iso under somewhat low light and it looks incredible, the colors and the noise just amaze me and that is why i give it a 5 stars, besides the other goodies that you all know, like the 1080 AF video, weather seal magnesium body, etc it improved a lot, I can only compare it to the D90 since i never used a d300(s), I wish the controls would match more to the d700 so i'm not all over looking for function buttons but oh well. I almost got a d300s just because of that.
I also wanted to point out that the test that i did, i used a nikon 24-70 F2.8 witch its a great sharp lens so that also helps.
Just make sure you know what functions you need and make a decision base on that, a simple but mighty D40 could be all you need.

find my stuff in facebook under [...]/OscarPallares. Photography

thx

UPDATE

Well a year has passed and i am still in love with this camera, i use it more than my d700, it matches the 35 1.8g lens very well for everyday shooting with awesome IQ. with the more expensive lens like my 24-70 2.8 it just shines at weddings. so don't be affraid to pull out the wallet this baby its so worth it.
you can see a lot of my images taken with this camera in fb BUT you won't be able to tell if they were taken with the d7k or d700 so for better camera description find me in flickr.

It is aimed as an in-between D90 and D300s; however, it outshines them both.

Pros:
1) Saves and Recalls full sets of camera settings with new U1 and U2 positions on the dial.
2) It has 2 card slots, so you can save your pictures on both cards at the same time, creating an automatic backup.
3) New 2,016 segment RGB meter (yes, a full color RGB meter unlike Canon's black and white)
4) Magnesium alloy body makes it tough
5) It has an autofocus meter so it works and autofocuses all lenses (unlike my D500 which only autofocuses with AS lenses)
6) The built-in flash can be used as a remote commander for external flash units
Great processor; well placed, intuitive controls; amazing range of shutter speeds (from 30 secs to 1/8000 sec)

Although it also comes bundled with an 18-105mm lens, you can buy the body only and use it with the phenomenal VR 55-200 lens.",10-17-2010,10-17-2010

My main criteria for purchasing this camera was to have a wide range of uses.  You are able to shoot both Pictures and Video with this Camera.  I have been using this camera for 6 months and have found the picture quality has been great and the video quality is also wonderful.  I really like the fact that the camera uses SDHC cards and has a two card set up on the camera.  It is easier to continue shooting, without having to worry about switching out your card.  I haven't had any problem with mine and would suggest this camera to anyone.

Don't fall into the trap that newer is better.  DSLR Cameras are all very comparable in many ways and I would suggest getting this camera at the right price over a lot of the newer models at full price!",02-09-2017,02-09-2017

Separate aperture and shutter speed controls combined with 6FPS really make this camera shine!,"This is a terrific camera. I was coming off of a Nikon D3000, so this was quite the upgrade. One note: the D3000 seemed to produce ultra sharp (nearly jagged looking shots that I love, whereas the D7000 has a slightly smoother effect (which I also like). The D7000's ISO can really benefit darker shots at ISO 1600 or 3200 that really look nice, and the 6 frames per second is super helpful when you have small children who smile quickly, and then, just as quickly, wipe it right off of their face. The D7000 has 2 separate wheels for aperture and shutter speed control if you opt to shoot on ""M"" (Manual) mode, which I highly recommend. It's much harder on the D3xxx and D5xxx models, as they require an extra step, which makes a big difference when you are shooting very quickly on the fly, and have one chance to grab the best shot. I typically use a nifty fifty (50mm prime f/1.8) on this camera, or a 35mm (f/1.8) prime with the Sharpness setting maxed out and on Vivid mode with Saturation +1, but sometimes bump it up or down depending on the situation. I'm incredibly pleased, and yes, this camera is 7 years old, but you will not be sorry. Highly recommended!!",02-07-2017,02-07-2017

There are too many features  to give detailed reviews but suffice to say it is a great camera.

I always thought that was just for point and shoots. And I still can't believe the resulting pictures of athletes moving full speed with direction changes and changing background with twenty sequence shots in about three seconds in each set. Every shot properly exposed, the action stopped dead in the air and everything in sharp focus using an AF-S Nikkor 18-200mm 1:3.5-5.6 zoom. Over the decades I have used Kodak, Minolta, Canon with every kind of telephoto and zoom lens available. Never had one that could do what this thing does. Of course the lens helps.

After months of research I finally decided Nikon was the way to go for me due to sensor technology that blew away Canon sensors.  It was personal, I understand there are fanboys on each side of the fence, but after looking at photos my friend and I did (I used my old Canon, he used this body) using comparable lenses and the same vantage point, this camera was able to capture so much more than my Canon.  After I upgraded to this, I've not looked back.  The pictures I take are so much better than my old Canon.

For perspective, my old Canon was only an XS1000.  This is Nikon Semi-Pro line.  To find a comparable Canon body with the same sensor strength and color capture, I'd have to spend almost $3000.  I bought this body brand new from Amazon for $350 when Nikon launched the D7200, dang near 90% off!

This is a super reliable and flexible platform.  It is built like a tank and not fiddly like so many other systems.  Metering, autofocus, white balance, and overall picture quality are SO much better than my EP-5.  My current body/lens combo is not noticeably bigger or heavier than my EP-5 with a ""pro"" zoom.

If you're in the market for a mid-tier camera, get one of these used - you won't regret it (as long as you purchase from a reputable dealer)! I have owned this camera since the end of 2012. It's old now, but if you can pick it up for $350-$375, it's well worth it over the newer lower tier cameras like the D5500 or D3300, even if it has lower resolution or slightly lower image quality. Why?

First off, it has a top deck display - an LCD panel on the top of the camera that has all of your relevant settings available for viewing on the top of the camera at all times. I guess I've been a bit spoiled - I got into the DSLR game in 2007, when even the lowest class D50 (I have fond memories of this body) had a top deck display, and I've never been without one since. It's so useful that I can't shoot without one, it messes with my whole workflow. Others agree, it's quicker and much easier when shooting to check all your settings in a well organized top deck display than it is to constantly check the back screen.

Secondly, it has weather proofing. It's not as strong as pro grade stuff, but I have shot in the pouring rain in 50 degree weather for extended periods of time (2 hours of consistent light rain) and my camera was soaked! But, it continued to run flawlessly. I have gone through many detrimental conditions where many electronics would not survive, but my D7000 is a champ.

It's an all-around tough camera that will pay for itself in no time. I made $300 the other day with this camera.. that could pay for a second D7000 in today's market. I've dropped it a couple times when I was careless (it happens over the course of 3 years..) but it took my beatings like a champ.

D7000 vs D5xxx - The only reason I'm getting rid of my D7000 is to upgrade to a D800E, because I need more resolution. You PROBABLY do not need more resolution. In the past 9 months I have sold two prints over 20""x30"" (one was 28""x35"") and I have another 24""x30"" going into a show this Thursday.. I print high res, and I plan to print even bigger. I LOVE detail. I LOVE the idea of being able to get up close and personal with a BIG print and still see minute details. I am a rare breed of photographer who can actually utilize more resolution. If it were not because the D7000 only offers me 16mp (which turns out to be more like 14mp after small cropping adjustments,) I could probably use this camera for my work for another 5 years before image quality alone improved enough to make the jump. The image quality of the D7000 is GREAT. Honestly, for its time it was the best of its grade, and it continues to do stellar work day after day. You do not need to pay twice as much for a D5500, because the extra resolution will take up space and time, and the D5500 lacks in functionality compared to the D7000. The only reason I would want the D5500 was if I was a cinematographer - the swivel screen is pretty much a necessity in that regard. I wish this D7000 was released in 36mp, because I wouldn't have a reason to upgrade to Nikon's top of the line...

The only downside to the D7000 are some of the small errors that have occurred over time. Once the camera froze up and I had to remove the battery to get it to work. Another time the camera wouldn't turn off, even when I switched it to 'OFF'... Minor frustrations, but always solved by removing the battery. These problems have occurred less than ten times over the course of 3 years, and never got in the way of my shooting.",09-16-2015,09-16-2015

I've been a professional photographer, a semi-pro as well, and have used Nikon products since my teen years in the late 1960's. I've owned three DSLR's from Nikon and two from Olympus. Nikon beats the competition hands down. I've had the D3000; D5000; and now the D7000. The D7000 outshines them all. The high speed continuous 6fps capabilities for up to 100 shots, is absolutely essential if you do sports photography. Although there are newer models (D7100 and D7200), this gem is priced right. I would strongly suggest you do NOT use third party lenses, pay the extra money and use Nikon glass. Same for external flashes. When you buy Nikon accessories, you know that they will work seamlessly and properly every time. I bought the battery grip and it gives the camera that small added stability for handheld shots.

More megapixels does not equal better pictures.  The artist needs to know how to use the camera.

I liked the D90 but I love my D7000.  The Noise performance is sooo much better and it has more control especially when using the remote.  It fits my hand and feels very solid while shooting.  The shutter is quiet and it even has a quiet mode for places that frown on noisy camera's.  The D7000 has many modes if that's your thing but I shoot mostly manual and prefer the control of my shots.  It has 2 user memories that you can store settings in.  So you can have your favorite settings for portraiture and one for landscapes for instance.  The D7000 uses the Sony Sensor which I feel is superior in color rendering over the Toshiba sensor of the D7100.  Look up the differences online.  Reds with the D7000 are true red while the 7100 are burgundy.  The D7000 is about 500 dollars cheaper then the D7100 and just as good if not better in performance.

Just got it yesterday though I had one borrowed from a fellow coworker, and using my 18-200 VR2 Nikkor lens on a weekend full of landscape photography I was amazed on how well it performed compared to my previous Nikon D3300, I mean, One of the reasons I made the upgrade to this D7000 body was the Focus Points, 39 vs 11 (at D3300), also its weather sealed to shoot under certain conditions, plus its more efficient Sensor....among other things...

So I tested it and indeed felt like I was loosing time shooting with my previous D3300, of course, Im taking about my needs as a Semi-pro photographer...

I didn't went for the Nikon D7100 since I put into the balance its difference between the previous version, and the huge amount of difference in price, just for the body, is crazy, so I decided to give it a go to this awesome mid-range camera. Also, for being a $500 body, I think its a great deal.

My recommendation, get a decent lens, not the regular cheap ones, ---

Amazon stood behind the product and cross shipped me a new camera overnight air.  They have EXCELLENT customer service at Amazon.  I wish Nikon was as good.  The camera is capable of professional quality images but I need to warn you that some of these are not properly caliberated new in the box.  White balance is heavy on the GREEN tint and focus can also be problematic on some units.  If your willing to send it in for caliberation (that takes two weeks) then you'll have a very good camera.

I had a brief run as a professional photographer and shot a lot of film over the years with manual focus cameras, so I was a bit uncertain about auto-focus (not-so-affectionately called ""ought-to-focus"" back in the day). Overall, this camera rewards my faith in Nikon and in the technological improvements (e.g. autofocus, built-in winder, built-in flash, and of course the convenience of instant feedback with digital images) that have been added over the years. Feels sturdy and substantial in the hand (just like the F series), without nearly so many additional components (flash, winder) to be juggled. I find that with the recording media being almost free compared to film, I spend less time getting things perfect and more time just shooting. Also, this camera has so many pre-programmed shooting modes, I also end up fiddling with exposure settings rarely.
One really important feature for me is that this camera is fully backward-compatible with old Nikor lenses, and I have a bunch of specialty lenses that I can still use; you lose auto-focus of course, but the rest of the automatic functions do work.
I still need to learn how to transfer darkroom skills to Lightroom, but at least for getting the images taken, this is a huge step up in convenience.",01-13-2015,01-13-2015

I am very pleased with the quality, handling and feel of my D7000.

This is simply one of the best options there are for people who want to upgrade from a D3xxx/D5xxx. In my opinion, the access buttons to ISO, WB, etc make a lot of difference when shooting outdoors especially action or birds.

I recommend this product.

I've3 had the Sigma for a few years; in fact, it's the second one I've had as the first one died while under warranty. I was never satisfied with the Sigma, never. I purchased a Sigma 18 - 50 f 2.8 lens (a very nice and fairly expensive lens) as my main lens. Also bought a Sigma speedlite. All in all, I had a fair amount of $ tied up in Sigma stuff. But I never felt my pix were what they should be; exposure was never right, not crisp, etc.
So on the 19th of December the SD14 started acting up. I was not ready to buy a new camera but Christmas was coming and we have grandkids. So I did a bit of shopping on Amazon and decided to bite the bullet and buy a new camera. I settled on the Nikon D7000 kit which included a Nikkor 18-55 and Nikkor 55-300 F4.5- lens.

Reviews about the camera and price dropped down so much had sold me and I couldn't justify the price of a new full frame. But after using the camera for a couple of months and hundreds of pictures, I realized that the pictures were soft, grainy out of focus no matter which lens or high or low ISO I use, I was puzzled, because the pictures from the D70s 6 Mega Pixels is much sharper and cleaner than the D7000, this is suppose to be a great camera in low light and has a new sensor.... finaly I decided to send it to Nikon to check it out since it still under warranty, 2 weeks later they send it back to me with a list of things theyve done of course free of charge, here is what they did
adjust auto focus operation, adjust auto focus unit, adjust mirror angle, CKD comunication ( I don't know whats that mean), adjust white balance and clean CCD.  I tested it right when I received it sure there is a lot of improvement in terms of focus and grain but still the d70s has abetter cleaner pics, the thing is this camera the D7000 has some limitations in terms of lens  tolerance, I used three different lenses  still the issue is there.
Yes the camera has great features two slots memory cards, 2 users  setting, light weight good battery etc... to me the most important thing a bout any camera is picture quality, you can get good quality from this camera don't get me wrong a lot of positive reviews about it, the problem is the high density of pixels in the sensor ( 16.2 Mega pixels )  that is a lot for a DX sensor  , so you need to use different  techniques when using it like extra steady hand, using a tripod when you can,  light or flash in short its not easy to get great pics out of this camera, I do not claim to be a pro, but I got great results from a much older camera Nikon d70s with 6 mega pixels.  Google D7000 grainy pics and focus problems you will be amazed how many D7000 owners have the same problem, Nikon knows about this problem thats is why the price dropped down so much and the release of the update for it D7100 which I don't know if the problem of focus is  fixed or not, I am very disappointed because I like the camera the feel of it the light weight, the features ... but I couldn't live with the grainy pics and the unpredictability of the image quality, if I am upgrading it better be a better quality or whats the point, I ended up selling it and bought the full frame D700fx used in great condition, and I could not be happier with D700 image quality just amazing, fast focus high quality smooth clean pictures unbelievable low light capability, they say a good camera does not make a good photos, a good photographer makes a good photo, but with a great camera like The D700fx you can be sure of a good quality you just need to concentrate on good composition, more pixels not necessarily better quality ...fat pixels are both very forgiving of lens resolution and natural-looking, too. 12MP on full frame is a sweet spot for most users; anything more demands an ever-increasing price in optical quality and shot discipline that gets very challenging and of limited returns very quickly.",12-24-2014,12-24-2014

I got the camera back from Nikon with mixed results. Thank goodness Amazon has an amazing return policy, it's going back. I may try a D7100.

I did not get it from amazon, as it did not have the exact kit combination I wanted. but the price here for body only and other kit combinations is very very good. this camera is probably more than the most non-professionals would need. its image quality is excellent even in low light conditions. d7100 could be a better camera but due to the price difference it makes more sense to get d7000 and a nice lens. d7100 does not have the features that would swing my decision; it does not have GPS or WI-FI. so just for a marginal image quality difference and better focusing I could not justify spending nearly 400 dollars more. I would save the difference towards a good lens. At this mature stage of camera technology, newer cameras increase image quality only marginally but a good lens always makes a huge difference and is durable.
update:
I bought a used, very old but clean 50mm f1.4 AI-S lens to use with this camera. It is a completely manual focus lens but this camera guides you to capture perfect focus. a left or right pointing arrow tells you to turn the focus ring left or right and when you get the exact focus it turns into a dot. this is a great help for my inaccurate eye to capture exact focus.",12-16-2014,12-16-2014

I inherited some old Nikon F gear years ago - gave it to relatives, save an F body & macro lens, which I used in a copy stand. I decided on Nikon DSLR family because that old macro lens would work - albeit as a preset lens - in the Nikons - and the D7000 was chosen for price, construction, and features. I added a 35 1.8 DX lens as that would be a 'normal' lens in the 2/3 format. That was 9/13. As a former photography instructor, I need to 'make my own decisions' as to exposure and focus - and this body & lens combination certainly permits that - and so much more. The last fifteen months have seen me add a 50 1.8 as a short portrait/knock around lens, an 85 3.5 macro for my close-up needs, and, ugh, a zoom lens - a 16-85 f3.5-5.6 shocker (It really is sharp at the WA range!). I enjoyed the D7000 so much, I just (12/14) bought another D7000 body - super Seasonal price, too. Not for my old multiple SLR bodies use - one for color, one for B&W, etc - you can do that electronically. I like the D7000 and lenses I have - and a spare body is just handy. EX: one with the 16-85 zoom and the other with the 35 1.8 - or 85 macro. In any case, I have 'arrived'... finally... in the DSLR world. I still have so much to learn, too.

It replaced a D90 which replaced a D80.  D80 was a very good camera but got noisy quickly when the scene got dim.  The D90 cleaned a lot of it up.  After the birth of my first kid, I found the D90 struggled with indoor pics at night and dawn.  So, happily, this gave me reason to upgrade again.

I chose between D7000 and D7100.  From reviews, I couldn't really tell the difference between these two cameras' test shots found online.  And, I didn't need the 24 megapixels.  16 is more than enough for me.  Plus, D7000's layout is more ergonomically familiar to me since I am coming from a D90.  So, I chose the D7000 over the D7100.  It was icing on the top when I found it on sale during BFD.  Pretty much got the camera for free since the price I paid for it was the same as the kit lens' msrp.

I do ""struggle"" with whether I want to upgrade to full frame such as D610 or the new D750.  However, I think I am sticking the DX a bit longer and perhaps wait for the new D9300 to come out before upgrading again.  DX is great because the lenses are so much cheaper.  And, the benefits FX has over DX is quickly diminishing as sensor technology is improving at lightening speed during these past few years.  I would love to get rid of the 1.5x crop factor, but I don't want to at the cost of buying much more expensive glass at the full frame end which are bigger and heavier to carry.

My 17-55mm f2.8 is on the D7000 most of the time.  And, it produces beautiful pictures with the flexibility for both wide and midrange angles.  If I wanted to go wider with FX, I have to spend a lot of money on a 17-35mm which is a god awful heavy and expensive lens with less tele than the 17-55mm.  Or, I can go with the 16-35mm which is cheaper but is f4 rather than f2.8 constant.  I could get the 24-70mm but that is exactly the same effective range as the 17-55mm.  So, because of lens cost, function and weight of the full frames, I think it's smarter to stay with DX for now.

Oh, the D7000 takes fantastic indoor night pics hand held with the 17-55 f2.8.

Some notes.  I configure the function button to activate RAW shooting mode.  So, with one press of the function button, your very next exposure will record in both jpeg and raw format.  This allows me to do a lot of test shots to frame and adjust parameters before recording in raw format to save on SD card space.  This helps my workflow as I hate having to open up numerous RAW files while editing.

Also, I thought I'd like the second SD slot a lot but I don't use the second slot at all.  At first, I thought I could configure the camera so the second slot will save only RAW files while the first slot saves all the JPEG files.  But, I couldn't do so.  For me, this defeats the purpose of having a second card slot.  I don't take enough exposures in a day or even a week to fill up a 32gb card, so the second slot is useless to me.

Conclusion:  I think this camera is the sweet spot in terms of price, performance and functionality.  It does pretty much what all of the more expensive Nikon models does (at least the things that I care about) but at a fraction of the price.

For manufacturer: I am minimalistic and prefer my cameras not too have too many bells and whistles and don't want a fold out LCD screen.  I think those are ugly and cheap looking.  So, to me, the D7000 is ahead of the game because it doesn't have a lot of features I don't cluttering the menu and body.  I was tempted to get the Fuji XT1 because of its minimalistic body but plethora of useful dials.  But, I don't like their Xtrans sensor.  I guess I am an odd ball who doesn't prefer a sensor that produces an over massaged image.

And, let the user configure what type of files is stored on which SD card slot.  The default choices are not ideal at least not for me.",10-01-2014,10-01-2014

I was originally going for the D5200, it being 1,5x the megapixels and with 60fps video.  The reason I got this instead is because the D7000 works with older AI-S lenses and has an autofocus motor which I needed since all of my lenses were AI-S or AF.  Basically the only lenses that will work with the D3xxx, or D5xxx are the new plasticky no Aperture ring lenses (not a fan).  Because of this, I got the D7000 over the D5200.  I've had it for almost a week now, and I can say that it is a very nice camera!  16,2 MP is plenty, and the image quality is superb.  The battery life is super long (lasted 3 days of shooting on one charge) and the 2 SD Card slots are a nice edition.

The conclusion is:
If you are considering a D5200/D5300 or this, think about what you want in the camera.  If you NEED those extra megapixels, or NEED the flip-out screen, then go for the D5xxxx.  However, if you have older lenses that you want to use, or just like a sturdier, weather sealed beast, go for the D7000.  It will not disappoint.

It has proven to be a substantial upgrade, particularly improving low light performance. I actually preferred the feel of the more rounded D80 handle but this one is still quite good. Exposure is better than my D80 but still suffers occasional over-exposure in some scenes. Most of the time it is spot-on. Just be alert for scenes with extended dynamic range. The ergonomics of the controls is somewhat improved although I wish Nikon would let us adjust ISO manually past the ISO allowed in auto-ISO without having to disable auto-ISO.

I bought this as a used ""like new"" unit from Amazon Marketplace. It has proven to be a great value. While the appearance was ""like new"" and all accessories arrived nicely wrapped (including the warranty card) the camera actually had 4500+ actuations. I am not sure this qualifies as ""like new"" vs ""very good"" but I don't think this is something Amazon looks at in their grading. Over all, given the camera is rated at 150K actuations, this seems like a non-issue in practice.

For people on a budget who want a pro-quality DX, especially for sports or wildlife, there is nothing wrong with this model. The D7100 wasn't much of an upgrade. It also outperforms the D5200 in real-world shooting.

It only came with the body and cap and battery and charger, but I have multiples of the extras that come with the camera out of the factory (cables, straps). My model had just over 18k clicks when I got it, and in the past 4 days of owning it, I've put it to over 19k. I can't put the thing down.

I was upgrading from a D5100 because I needed manual exposure controls for video, and I had heard loads of great things about this camera. I love that everything can be controlled by a button or dial. I can shoot so much faster now that I never have to navigate menus. I used to have my D5100 configured so I could change ISO, shutter speed and aperture all using the single command dial plus a button and I thought that was nice, but I didn't realize how limited I was until I got this. If I wanted to change AF modes, drive mode, white balance, metering mode, I'd have to hunt through menus. Now I can control every exposure/shooting function using only the camera's external controls and the top LCD. It's great.

I know people complain about the lack of 30 fps in 1080, but let's face it; 30 fps is really only used in broadcast television, and approximately 0% of people who shoot for TV are shooting with a DSLR. Yeah, so higher frame rates would be nice for slow motion stuff, but if you are at a level where you're using features like that, chances are you know another video guy with something you can borrow for that shot. For 90% of my video needs, this camera satisfies. If you do mostly video though, maybe a Canon system would better suit your needs. Personally, it's about 80/20 photo/video for me, and this camera stretches my dollars much further than most. AF is useless for video, as expected, but most serious video people know that manual focus is the way to go while rolling anyway, so not a deal breaker whatsoever.

For stills, AF is lightning fast, and is even great in low light. Silent focusing with all my AF-S lenses, and still pretty quiet on my 50 1.8 AF D as well as the couple of AF zooms I've used on it.

Since I've only used this camera for a few days, I'll end it there and keep this review updated in the coming months after more use.",05-13-2014,05-13-2014

The quality of images is great. I have been taking pictures with D7000 for 3 years and would give 5 stars for its photo capabilities and image quality. I also shot a few videos with this DSLR, and did not like the audio, especially when recording music. I know I am not going to skew the average rating of D7000 by giving it 3 stars, but I hope this will flag the review to help alter the problematic audio of this camera. As many are aware, the audio of the movie provides over half of the overall impressions of the movie.

Quite a few reviewers mentioned the poor sound from the D700 that can be described as ""tiny"", not loud enough, having significant noise, and sometimes distorted (slow reacting auto gain?). It is commonly suggested to use an external microphone and place it off camera to improve the sound and eliminate the focusing noise. You can further improve the sound by connecting a directional mic first to a personal recorder which you would, in turn, connect to the D7000. The sound will still be limited by the capabilities of the D7000 recording module, which was reported to record sound in the meager, 150-5000 Hz range. Please find the link to that report by the Finnish magazine, Tekniikan Maailma (World of Technology). in the comment below this review. With this rigging, you will have an improved, although still phone-like, sound matched with the video. Capturing the sound with a quality recorder and syncing the audio with the footage in the post can ensure an ultimate adudio. I explored a few options and chose the Sennheiser MKE 600 directional mic ($330) and Sony PCM M10 portable recorder ($225-250) to improve my D7000 audio, especially when shooting video of quiet music recitals at some distance from the performer. I compared the above Sennheiser mic with 2 cheaper Bronstein shotgun microphones side by side. The former sounded pretty good even when plugged directly in the camera, and the Bronstein mics were too quiet (although I tried one of them on a Sony camcorder, and it worked well). When I am using the Sony recorder (instead of or in combination with an external mic), I connect the recorder to the camera with a 35 dB attenuation cable so the sound is not clipped in D7000. This produces a relatively good sound in-camera, and I am still getting a copy of a better audio in the recorder as an option for post processing. The direction of the attenuation cable must be observed or the sound will be ruined. A recorder's built-in omnidirectional stereo mics (instead of a shotgun) will also greatly improve the sound, but a shotgun mic will help isolate the intended sound and suppress side/back noise. To hear how the audio sounds when recorded with D7000, Sony PCM M10, Sennheiser and 2 Bronstein mics (connected to camera, or recorder, or first to recorder and then to camera), please follow the link to my YouTube video in the comment below (or search YouTube for ""Microphones compared: Sennheiser MKE 600, Bronstein BRN-900, BRN-400, Sony PCM M10, Nikon D7000"". Please note that the source sound level in that test was intentionally turned down and the mics or camera placed 10 feet away from the source to compare how they record relatively quiet sounds. The setup of this test required to increase gain on the recorder, which increased the noise levels, but the noise is still acceptable for Sony and Sennheiser. There are many shotgun microphones to choose from. After testing just a few of them, I noticed that their perfomance varied greately on D7000. I got Sennheiser after testing 3 other shotgun mics that produced low sound levels, and one mic in the review was too noisy.",05-08-2014,05-08-2014

I shoot in manual mode primarily. The 2 presets U1 and U2 can be very useful for having a couple of different settings ready for different effects.

The dynamic range is about 3/4 stop better for highlights and shadows.

Sure the D7100 has better specs et al, but in real life the D7000 is fantastic.  I am a professional photographer.  I don't believe in spending $6000 dollars on a camera body because 5 years ago the D7000, for instance, would've cost $6000.  It's all a game to keep us buying new cameras every year.

You might say it's a subjective point of view, but since I've been shooting film too (with the great F5) and has my share of digital compact experience (Lumix LX3K), I've been wanting to upgrade to a different, (presumably) better DSLR only a few months after I bought this one, thinking that it was obsolete. It has now been over a year, within which new, amazing DSLRs have been launched. The fact that this one sells for under $900, makes it a no brainer for anyone who's been doing (or wants) a bit more than just snap shooting with a do-it-all-good-for-nothing compact camera. Of course, if a few hundred buck is no problem, get the D7100, or if DX is not good enough for you, by all means get the Canon 6D, the best, cheapest full frame to date. But if you want the SAME picture quality (as seen on any computer screen), flexibility and ease of use as a professional FX body, for a lot less money, THIS is still the best choice. With the money you pay for a 6D with kit lens you can get a new D7000 + a new Tokina 12-28, f/4 (best DX wide in my opinion) + a new Nikon 35mm, f/1.8 DX (most versatile DX prime) and a spanking brand new Nikon 80-200D-ED, f/2.8, a great FX zoom lens that gives you the best portrait focal length (120mm) and goes all the war to 300mm at a constant, professional aperture of f/2.8.

I got a big  box store Black Friday deal on the older but well-praised unit for half-price, $800, complete with a reknowned Nikon 18-140 mm VR zoom lens. The lens alone lists for about $800, so it was a no-brainer purchase at the time. Being somewhat handicapped from a mobility standpoint, I must do most of my buying on-line and don't usually have the luxury of walking the malls and fighting the crowds to see what I'm getting ahead of time. What arrived via UPS was a much larger, heavy metal, weather-sealed, beautifully constructed camera with a hearty 5 lb. lens that made the Nikon D7000 look like the Pinocchio of the DSLR camera world. Overwhelmed by the array of buttons, arthritis- challenging weight, and telephone book-like instruction manual, I dove for the the Quick Start sheet, assembled the lens to the  camera, gently threw on a protective UV filter,  charged the battery, put in a class 10 SD card, and set it on the infamous,  life-saving green, full-auto setting to give it a test run against my trusty, lightweight, mostly plastic, not designed to withstand the elements Canon T3. After anticipating this moment for 3 years and feeling quite proud of the deal I got, I gathered the grandchildren's colorful Christmas toys and packages and set up a night-time test shoot on my bed, using only the pop-up flash and auto setting for each camera. I was prepared to be blown away and already wondering if i should keep or sell the T3. What happened next did shake me to the core, but not in a good way, more in a sad way. In side-by-side comparisons of identical shots taken by each camera, the Canon T3 digita pics were better in every case ( to my eye) as compared to the much more expensive Nikon D7000. Of course, this evaluation is very subjective and hardly intended to be the final word on the on-going Canon VS Nikon debate, but I was disappointed and knew instantly I would never be happy with the new camera, so it's going back tomorrow. I've come to terms with the fact that apparently I love a very lightweight, uncomplicated DSLR that gives me bragging quality shots of the grandkids every weekend with little to no effort on my part except to hold the camera steady as it works its magic. Essentially, though fabulous, though a great deal, the Nikon D7000 was and always will be too much camera for a person like myself. I'm sure with all it's available adjustments, a professional could re-shoot my pics and blow my mind. But the reality is, if you're a happy point and shoot person that wants beautiful pics without hardly any effort in a lightweight, easy to handle and transport mostly plastic package, I heartily recommend keeping your place with your entry level camera, you'll be much happier. I am glad I had this opportunity to test the camera for my particular use, or I'd be spending the rest of my amateur days wishing I could afford better. But now I'm super content, knowing that an entry-level camera like the Canon T3 is perfect for my purposes and skill level. Hope this helps people like me sleep better.",12-05-2013,12-05-2013

This camera is probably one of the best buys in DSLRS.

Easily one of the best in class.,"I've owned my d7000 for just under one year (Purchased, 1/2013) and absolutely love it! As the lifetime owner of several Canon camera's I felt the need to go outside the line despite the fact that I had invested heavily in Canon glass and accessories.  I looked at several options, the Sony A77, the Sony A99 (Full Frame), the Nikon D800, and the Nikon D600 all of which were perfectly capable camera's. I did extensive research reading written reviews as well as watching video reviews paying close attention to how the camera's stack up against one another in an attempt to help narrow my search. Second, I decided to take a trip to the local camera shops so that I could physically hold each camera and get a feel for them individually.  I really liked the Sony line because I felt they offered the biggest bang for the buck. My only problem was that I was not sold on the electronic viewfinder and less than desirable battery life that accompanied that particular technology. I resumed my search and although I did like the full frame options from Nikon I didn't want to plunge into the new system head first. This is when I came across the D7000 and really never looked back. All the reviews were positive and this camera had a lot to offer for the dollar. Solid construction, dual memory card slots, wide lens selection, and extremely good image quality. These are just a few of the tricks up this camera's sleeve!  Within a few days of holding this camera and debating I decided to purchase the camera (Body Only) and order the 35mm 1.8 separate with a battery grip and speed light. I have since added several more lenses to the arsenal and couldn't be happier with my choice. The color this camera render's (particularly when shooting raw) is nothing short of astonishing! I use this camera in a multitude of shooting scenario's and it handles like a champion. I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a professional grade camera that they can grow with.

This camera simply can't take consistently in-focus pictures.  Other reviewers mentioned this as well, but after further research I found that each lens needs to be calibrated for ""AF Fine Tuning.""  I never, ever had to do that for any of my Canon cameras.

Most DSLRs are limited to their individual processor speeds, and buffer sizes, and therefore, after five or six exposures, the camera ""locks-up"" temporarily, mis the tail end of a lot of action shots.

But since most applications do not require full size (in this case 16-22 meg) files, the frame rate and buffer size of the D7000 is more than adequate to get 8-10 frames of medium size (9 meg) photos in one burst.  This is the first DSLR that I've ever owned that has every thing I would expect from a serious camera.  the two user programable settings allow the photographer to save setting that they go to frequently.  Most of my photography is done in daylight, or with strobes, but about a third is done under tungsten lighting. The program modes allow me to keep one dedicated to the custom balance I use for tungsten lighting situations.

The two SD slots mean you almost never run out of room on your cards.

The D7000 has the solid feel of a film camera.  Something, I have missed in other DSLR units.  Color rendering  in the shadow areas of the photos is frighteningly good at times.  There is a richness in low light, and with tungsten lighting that is REALLY great.

I use this as a main, but I would not hesitate to use it as a back up to a pro model.  Unlike lower priced DSLRs, former 35mm photographers won't find themselves asking  ""Where's the...?"" and ""Why isn't there a...?"" like they do with lesser digital SLR cameras.  I've owned this camera for about two and one half years.  Just a delight to own and use.",09-01-2013,09-01-2013

Yet with all the added features and expanded capabilities, the basic Nikon interface remains the same, lowering the learning curve. Still exploring the onboard editing options.

This replaced my Nikon D200.  I like it very much.  Has great ability for low noise non flash pictures.  The only drawback is that in auto iso the flash still stays in it unlike the D200.

Soooooooo what I do is set the camera in  for normal weding photography using auto iso but if I go to flash then I use u2 which I set for manual iso.  I actually have 3 settings.  Normal is auto iso.  U1 is for bird photography with focus set for dynamic.  U2 is wedding photography without auto iso which I use for the mounted flash.  I prefer the way the D200 works for the flash but this gets me by.  The camera is superior to the D200 especially in low light.

Okay, i received the replacement from amazon and quickly did my barrage of tests. The new one is a little better, but some issues:
The center and right-center focus point back focus. The lower left focus point doesn't even focus at all and hunts forever! Tried multiple lenses, no go. Returning for a refund. Thank god i'm doing all this before the return window closes.

It seems Nikon is trying to deplete their stock so quickly that they are not even quality testing them before they leave the factory. My first one had 2 shutter actuation on it. There are 39 focus points. hmm...

I really loved my D7000 until I noticed some out of focus shots a couple of weeks ago. I ran through some focus test at home and everything seemed fine. This past weekend I took my daughter out into a wildflower field and thought I was getting once in a lifetime shots. There was perfect lighting on a nice overcast day all things were perfect for a perfect photo shoot. Once I loaded the images up on my PC and took a look I felt like smashing my D7000 with a sledge hammer. Most of the images suffered from back focus problems.(The flowers behind my daughter were in perfect focus) I ran some test using focus charts and can not correct the problem using fine tuning. I needed a camera and already had the D7000 battery grip so I decided to get another D7000 for $850. The new D7000 has right focus issues out of the box. It is going back and all my Nikon gear is getting traded in on Canon stuff. On a side note, I purchased the D600 last month and it went back within 4 days due to the dust and oil problems. Nikon quality has gone done to the grave. My brothers' made in Japan D40X still runs great after 6 years.",04-10-2013,04-10-2013

As my interest and abilities grew I decided that I had out grown the capabilities of the D3100 and have since stepped up to the D7000.  It is an excellent camera and will do everything that you want it to do.  The main reasons for upgrading were auto bracketing for HDR pictures (yes you can get this with the 5100/5200 also), the U1 and U2 modes for quickly switching back and forth between pre-set configurations, the additional auto focus points (from 11 to up to 39), continuous shooting speed (3 to 6 frames per second) and the D7000 has several more controls to make ease of shooting and changing settings on the fly much, much easier.

I would suggest the same progression that I took if you're getting into photography.  If you don't know what aperture, shutter speed, depth of field and ISO are or how to use them together then in my opinion you don't need to spend the extra money to purchase the D7000/7100.  Buy the D3200 with the kit lens and if after several months you never venture off of the auto dial then the 3200 will be the very best investment you can make for capturing moments.  If you begin to venture to the other semi-manual and manual modes then you'll probably realize that you may want to upgrade one day.  You'll probably also realize that having a back up camera with a different lens will be a very big plus too and you'll have that in your 3100/3200.

In summary: don't buy more than you need but when in need you absolutely can't go wrong with the 7000 or its new improved model the 7100 (currently $300 more).",04-09-2013,04-09-2013

Only slight complain. Camera of this quality should have a PC sync for studio and product photography use.

As I have not owned it until now, I wanted to share my thoughts on it in a more candid manner.  I was originally a Nikon shooter, first with a D80 and later the D90, but sold my D90 shortly before this camera came out because I was not impressed with the D90 and became curious about the Canon 60D, so I sold out of Nikon and bought into Canon for a while.  I have no brand loyalty, I was simply out to see which suited my style.  After shooting with the 60D for more than a year, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be, with both the camera and Canon's system.  This was no fault of Canon or the 60D, it is a great camera and a great system, but it just didn't handle the way my Nikons did.  I found myself having to think about the camera too much and my choice of glass left much to be desired, it was getting in the way of what I wanted to accomplish with it.  So I recently sold back out of Canon and into Nikon once more with this, the D7000 paired with the 85mm f/1.8G, and was quite impressed within the first few hours of using it.  I can't quite describe it other than to say that it just feels right.  After spending about an hour to set everything the way I want it, I instantly recollected how wonderful it was to shoot with the D80, which back in its day was an amazing camera.  The D90 in my opinion was a wasted design and probably did no one anymore good than the D80.  But the D7000 is altogether a different animal.  It does everything the D80 did, but faster and with a little more polish, an absolute joy to shoot.  ISO performance is just awesome.  I can shoot at ISO 1600-3200 with my 85 1.8G without a care for noise at all, and even 6400 looks okay.  It's there, don't get me wrong, but it isn't.  I can tell you that it looks a lot better than film does at ISO 800, with more dynamic range (and that's saying a lot).  The AF system is awesome as well.  39 points is overkill though.  I don't like AUTO AF because it chooses focus based on distance and with that many focus points, sometimes it will pick every point within the frame except the one you want.  I'm not always interested in focusing on whatever is closest to me so I set the AF drive to 9-point/AF-A and have found it to be the best way to use the AF on this camera, all 9 are cross-type AF points.  Essentially, it uses the center point as the primary, but allows the points around it to re-focus if you move the camera slightly, or if what you're shooting moves slightly.  It stays put though when you want it to.  6 frames per second is pretty trick and I like the Q-drive, it isn't silent but it's pretty quiet and automatically turns the beeper off when set.  I like it.  Two card slots are probably better than one but to be honest, I only use one.  It's cool that I can put two in though, for backup.  And lastly, the single most impressive feature of this camera by far (IMHO) is how it works with AI/s manual focus lenses, of which I have a few.  I set the non-cpu lens data for my Nikkor 55mm f/1.2, slapped it on, and not only will it tell you shutter speed AND the aperture value in A mode (which it writes to the EXIF), but the three-way focus indicator nails focus at f/1.2!  Sold.  That lens is impossible to focus without a split-image rangefinder or 10x zoom in live-view.  It's made of magic, I swear.

I like this camera, it is definitely worth every penny and 5 stars.  The D7100 will be the evolution of the D7000, but do yourself a favor a wait one if you're trying to decide between it and this camera.  I suspect if you're reading this review at this point, you're probably trying to decide whether to get this or the D7100.  Get this one first and become proficient with it.  In a few months, the D7100 will sell for a grand or less and getting it will be like using this camera only more awesome.  Canon cameras at this level (DX/APS-C) just aren't as good, also in my humble opinion, and I've used both.",03-05-2013,03-05-2013

Paired with a Nikon 24-70mm 2.8f lens and a Sigma 70-200mm 2.8f lens, this thing is a BEAST compared to my D80.

The biggest differences I see are:
1) The focus speed and accuracy - with the 39 AF points it captures most of my shots with my kids running around
2) Amazing usability at high ISO ranges - I mean I've had this cranked up to 2500 ISO and zero graininess on indoor pictures at my kids b-day parties with no blur at shutter speeds as low as 1/80.
3) 6 shots per second - doesn't sound like much but taking shots of the kids running around, you get some great expressions you would otherwise miss
4) Ability to shoot video.  Obviously not the main reason I got this, but it's a nice feature to use once in a while
5) dual memory card slots.  Can you see never run out of room with 2 32 GB SD cards loaded? :-)

My plan was to pick up a D90 body after the D5200 was introduced and the price went down, but that changed after I held a D7000. I was ruined. Watching the prices I realized that the D90 was only a hundred bucks less than the D7000 so it wasn't worth considering and the then new D7100 didn't show enough difference to be worth the extra bucks.

After close to a year of use, and close to 6,000 photos taken, here are some of my reflections on the camera.

The Viewfinder- Bright, large and full of information. I can see what settings Im changing without taking my eye from the viewfinder.

Manual Settings- Very easy to access and once you get used to them, easy to change on the fly.

Low Light Capabilities- I normally set it at 160 (reminiscent of Kodak Portra) for normal shooting and have the automatic ISO set at a maximum of 6400 with a minimum shutter of 1/30th. I took a photo of my grandson at ISO 6400 and cropped the image after converting to black and white. Making it full screen on the laptop and zooming in on it to the equivalent of a 16x20. It still looked good with some noise that gave it the look of Tri-X-Pan. Indoor color shots of food (thats my primary use of the camera, food blogging) at 1600 ISO are magnificent. Over that, you do get some noise.

Two card slots- Nice feature. I set it up so I shoot JPEG on one card and RAW on the second.

Depth of Field Preview- I missed this feature on cheap cameras.

Focus- Many people claim this camera has a back focus issue. I cant say that I have it on mine; I cant say that I do. What I can say is that I find it to be the fastest focusing camera Ive ever had. I also find that it focuses on what I want, most of the time. No camera will ever be 100% accurate.

Sharpness- Pictures are sharp and clear. I set the color to vivid for almost everything but portraits where I use some tweaked settings on portrait.

Live Screen- Nice, but I like the viewfinder. It doesnt like to autofocus as well in live mode as the camera uses a different (more archaic) focus system. I haven't used to video mode as yet, it wasn't important in buying the camera.

Video- This wasn't important, but I have used it a couple of times and the quality is good. I plan to do some time lapse work at the beach this summer so it will come in handy.

By the way, I use prime lenses only. I have a 10.5 fisheye, 35 f1.8, 50 f1.8 and an 85 f3.5 micro. All focus well for me.

Overall, Id recommend this camera to the photographer who wants superb photos and ease of control.",02-20-2013,02-20-2013

Some people probably wonder the purpose of this ""upgrade"", since both D5100 and D7000 share the same sensor. It is obvious that D7000 has a tougher and heavier body. However, my main reason for the upgrade is the quality of picture. Really! From comparing and analyzing pictures taken by both cameras, I notice that pictures from D7000 are sharper and have more contrast, especially under less-than-perfect shooting conditions. The difference is from the better 39-point focus system of D7000. Under bright light, the picture quality should be very similar, if not the same. However, under low light and less contrast condition (such as foggy days), the difference is very noticeable. The D7000 performs very well and focuses accurately. Therefore, the pictures are sharper and exposed more accurately. In addition, I believe the heavier weight also play a part in sharper pictures due to less ""handshake"". Of course there are some personal shooting techniques and habits that can play a part in picture quality. However, this is the result from my personal experience. Furthermore, even though D7000 is heavier (than D5100), I don't feel sore or stress on my neck after half a day's shooting. It doesn't hurt either that the price on D7000 is dropping to an affordable level. The D5100 is still very good, easy to use, and an excellent entry into DSLR. However, the D7000 gives me the confidence and comfort of making something spectacular. I dare to dream.",02-08-2013,02-08-2013

But the D7000 is truly amazing! It is my fourth Nikon digital camera (my D70 still works) and got it due to a price reduction through Amazon. I expected the D7000 to be good but was surprized beyond expectations! In spite of it's advanced technology, the learning curve for this camera was not too steep. It did help that I read up on it after I ordered it so I was at least familiar with it. Also, I checked Ken Rockwell's web site to see what he had to say about it (very positive). The D7000 practically thinks for itself! It's tempting to just set it on ""Auto"" and do everything from there. But I like to set the Aperture, Shutter Speed, etc myself and just have fun with it. I am NOT a professional so I shoot pictures for the sheer joy of it. One tiny reason that I decided to buy this camera even though I really didn't need it is that I have Nikon's SB-600 Speedlight. By setting the camera's flash control to ""Commander"", it gives me wireless TTL flash using the SB-600 (just like the D70). Having used Nikon film cameras for as long as I have, it means I have a few Nikkor lens sitting around. They can be used with the D7000, just let it know the lens information and you're all set. If all you need for your photography needs is a Point-and-Shoot, then get one. But if you want to have a little fun and get good results, get the D7000! I recommend it!",02-04-2013,02-04-2013
https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D7000-DSLR-Body-Only/dp/B0042X9LC4?th=1,29,Electronics,Nikon D7000 DSLR (Body Only) (OLD MODEL),4.6,5,Another D7000 with Back Focus!!,"Just like a lot of others, I too got a camera with the notorious back focus 'problem'! .

But I was not worried because, before deciding on D7000 I did a search and found that back focus or front focus issue is not a specific D7000 (or Nikon) issue. Canon, Pentax, Sony, Olympus...they all have similar 'issues' and most of their prosumer or high-end cameras come with an in-camera option to address this, just like the one there is present in D7000. (They use different terminology though..Nikon calles it AF Fine tune; Canon/Sony - AF Micro Adjustment; Olympus - AF Focus Adjust; Pentax - AF Fine Adjustment etc). Also, I understood that there are a lot of kits available in the market to help this calibration/fine tuning (Datacolor SpyderlensCal for example). So, fine tuning looked like something that is not uncommon with pro-prosumer type camera bodies.

I do not know whether this is to be seen/called as a 'problem' or not....Because this also could be viewed as having 'more control' over our gear, at some point. I did not face any back focus issue with my D5100 (or my Canon T2i), so, there indeed was a moment of frustration when I got a camera that looks somewhere else when I ask it to 'look there'.

Personally, I find this as a pain than a problem because I had to fine tune two of my lenses (a 35mm 1.8 and a 16-85mm (both were bought used)...third one, a 55-300 mm auto focuses just fine without any fine tuning). So, should one stay away from D7000 because of this terrible back focus 'problem'? Nope... D7000 might back focus when paired with some lenses but at the same time, the camera comes with a built-in feature to address this concern. If that fails to resolve the issue, then,  ONLY then, it becomes a problem.

There are more than enough blogs/videos related to 'how to do AF fine tuning' hence I am skipping 'how I fixed it'  part...but I would like to mention that checking/enabling the 'Focus Point' (that can be found under 'Disply Mode' in PLAYBACK MENU) before taking the fine tuning test shots makes it bit easy (because, at the time of playing it back,  it would show where exactly we had focused).

A few things (among the many) I liked about D7000:

1. Excellent, durable build quality
2. Great picture quality
3. More direct controls
4. Brighter view finder with 100% coverage
5. Long battery life
6. Two memory card slots
7. Decent video
8. User control over fps (personal preference. I have one of the shakiest hands in the world and hence I often shoot more than one frame whenever I shoot critical shots. Many a time, 6fps is wasting memory by filling the card with similar shots, especially considering D7K's low buffer)

What I did not like:

1. Position of the ISO button (I wish it was on the top, just like my (wonderful) Canon T2i)
2. Low buffer
3. Plasticky LCD cover

(It is to be noted that this is neither a beginner camera nor designed for people with no patience and hence one should not expect  great shooting experience straight out of the box with any lens attached to it. Being said that, if a beginner is patient, not intimidated by some extra buttons, ready to read the boring user manual (this is very important) and want to learn photography, then D7000 has everything one need to learn photography or even make a living).

Overall, I am pretty happy that I bought this camera...Awesome camera.

U1 and U2 customizable user modes

This camera fit the bill perfectly. The only feature I wish it had was an FX size (35mm) sensor. But when I compared the price of the D7000 DX body to the D600 FX body I couldn't justify the additional cost -- plus I'd end up replacing a lot of DX size lenses with FX lenses.

Features that were important in my decision process:

-- fast continuous shutter for sports shooting
-- great high ISO performance and noise reduction
-- user definable settings (U1 and U2)
-- 3D tracking focus (works great for sports photography)
-- size and weight (I was concerned the weight would be too much but this camera is very easy to hold and carry)
-- sturdy construction and reasonable weather proof
-- focus motor to work with older Nikon AF lenses
-- high image resolution
-- good battery life

It takes a lot of time to understand and take advantage of all the features of this camera (I'm still learning) but it is worth the effort. I believe this camera is a terrific value if you're interested in a DSLR; I'm very pleased with it. I waited a long time after acquisition of my D60 to upgrade; I wanted to be sure I would make the right decision, and this camera has met my expectations. I plan to use this camera for many years.

There is one thing I wish Nikon would do with this camera: get rid of that tiny LCD on the top of the camera (near the shutter button) and add more direct control to the preview LCD on the back of the camera, like they do with the D5000 and D3000 series. This camera has some of that, but frankly, not enough. It relies too heavily on the numerous buttons located on the camera. I find it easier to quickly change features through the preview LCD than to have to remember how to use the buttons in combination with the dials.",02-01-2013,02-01-2013

And it has been a challenge to own this unit... When it works correctly, it is great, but I have been very challenged with it.. Here is the deal, and I think NIKON is the bigger problem than the camera, but that is hard to explain.. I have had a lot of problems with Nikon in recent years, most of them with their customer service and repair, which in my opinion is just the worst of any company I have done business with, except H&R BLOCK.. They really are a horrible company... Stay away from them and their products...
As for the D7000, I bought it because my D40 died on me in Utah while I was in Canyonlands doing a photo vacation with a photo buddy.. And, note, he uses Canon and never complains!!! While on the shoot, the shutter release died.. I called NIKON, they said send it back, so in a campground, I wrote a letter explaining the issue, took the camera and the letter to the UPS office in MOAB, and mailed the dead camera back to Nikon.. I finished the photo trip without a camera.. My buddy suggested I might need a more professional camera since I was using the D40 a lot.. Might have worn the D40 out.! While on the trip, I met another photographer who does great work and uses the D7000. You can see her work on the web by searching for Faund Images. Super work!... Back home I ordered the D7000 in October of 2011, I think it was. I was actually gettting the camera to learn how to use it before I left on my trip to Europe in October of 2012. The camera arrived, I did some test shots, and discovered the sensor was really dirty.. Really bad.. I called Amazon and reported it.. They would be happy to exchange it for a new one, but they did not have a new one. I could get my money back, but that would be a big problem because I had also ordered two lens, power grip, filters, extra battery, a flash, etc.. The camera was only a part of the whole order.. Returning it for money was not  a good choice.. I called NIKON and explained. A new camera had been delivered dirty.. They said they would check it out if I paid to have it returned, etc.. Could be a month or more to get the camera to them, cleaned and returned.. Not a fast service type thing, plus I had to pay for everything.. So, having the Copper Hill cleaning kit, I cleaned the sensor myself.. Turned out good. And things went well until I was back out west in Colorado doing fall color photos in Sept of 2012. The camera started burning out images. Not often, but two or three times per day, the camera would just decide to make a 1/125 second exposure into a 1/15 second exposure, etc... Burned the images out.. Then, later it stopped doing this on a regular basis.. I would liked to have sent it in for repair, as it was still under warranty at that time, but I was leaving for Europe in October. There would not be enough time to ship the camera to Nikon, get it repaired, because they are very slow, which I know from experience, then be able to take it to Europe with me, which was one of the bigger reasons for buying it and the 18-200 lens. .... It went to Europe with me. I arrived there on Oct 23. The camera worked until the morning of Nov 1. I took some early morning photos, then at 10 AM, just as I was taking a few photos of the tour bus, the camera started the image sensor issue again, and worse.. It did several things that were strange, and in the end it started leaving scan lines on all the images.. That was the end of the photos taking for this camera on this trip.. I still had 17 days of travel left and no camera to take photos with.. This camera was useless. There is another part of this story that I will share soon... I got home from my Europe trip on Nov 18. I mailed the camera to Nikon on November 23... I sent sample photos to show them how the camera had been acting in September in Colorado, and again on Nov 1. Their reply was a letter that stated these issues were caused by water damage. There had been no water or rain on it during the Sept time frame, but on the October 31, while on tour in Rome, it did rain on us.. It rained on us a lot.. I had a rain coat on, and I had a waterproof bag which I used to cover the camera.. I thought I had done a good job of keeping it dry. The people around me were using point and shoot cameras, Big Canon cameras, and even Ipads, to take photos.. None of these ever reported any problems from the rain or the moisture in the air, etc.. And, the advertisements suggests that the D7000 is weather resistant!!!!! Go fugure! What does that mean!!! After several calls and exchanges between Nikon and me, I got the camera back. They would not cover it under warranty, even though the issues started in Sept, long before the one year warranty ended in late October. I agree to pay for the repairs myself as I needed to get the camera back. As it turns out, I had insured all the camera gear before leaving on my trip. I called my insurance people and explained.. Turns out, my insurance would cover my end of the deal, assuming it was water damage.. While I was writing this, the insurance office called to say my money was in the mail.. The camera was mailed to Nikon on November 23, 2012.. I finally got it got it back on January 21, 2013.. The cost to mail it was 17.60, the repair charges were 542.68. There was an unexplained 108.54 discount, there was 18.34 in taxes. The final charge to me was 452.48.. This all adds up to 470.08 dollars to me.. The insurance company is mailing a check to me for this amount.. I got lucky on this part.. Good thing I took out the insurance before going on the trip.... I hope you will consider all this before buying NIKON products... When things work, they are great, when things go bad, you are in for a long hard trip... Think about it.. I am sort of stuck with them because once you start with a company and their equipment, it is hard to get away from them without losing a lot of money, etc....... I have some Canon cameras and have never had issues with them like this.. When I did have a small issue, they covered it fast and they sent letters of apology for me experiencing this issue!!!!!!!!! No apology, ever, from Nikon, plus they are slow and rude, etc... At this rate, I have to wonder how long they can stay in business. There  is one other thing to mention about this camera, the buttons and external controls cannot be locked, and are easy to change without you knowing it.. Several times I thought I was shooting in Normal-basic, etc, only to find that I was shooting in RAW, etc.. All the buttons and controls are unprotected. I have learned to not trust anything on this camera.. I have to check it constantly to make sure settings have not been changed, just by bumping into the controls etc.. Everything should be protected against changes unless you want them changed... Something else that is a problem, is that unlike earlier Nikons where the power grip had both batteries in it, and none in the camera, now, there is one in the camera and one in the grip. What a pain... I am constantly having to take the power grip off to get to the battery in the camera to recharge it... In previous models, the grip could stay on the camera all the time, but not with this thing... So, keep that in mind... I have no idea what these people were thinking when they did this... It sure makes it more difficult to use....  I think I have covered most of the material I have to offer at this time.. I will update if something new crops up, but having this camera is like having a problem child or a lemon car, you just cannot relax and use it. There is always the worry of what is going to go wrong next...",01-29-2013,01-29-2013

I've upgraded from a D60+Nikkor 18-200. Changed just the body and the lens is the same. I see a considerable difference in picture quality - especially in low light conditions. Looks like D7000 has so much better sensor. The body is bigger and easier to hold (than D60) in my big hands. And one of the main reasons I bought this camera (other than low light performance) is that it has full support for a grip (which makes it perfect for my hands + adds the vertical release button convenience).
Other things I like about this camera are more focus points (that made my pictures come out in-focus more often), the dials are great, and the addition (again compared to my previous experience w/ D60) of the control LCD panel on top w/ the current settings is great. I think the U1 & U2 user settings will come in handy once I learn how to use the camere better. Oh, and there are so many options to fine tune the behavior (in D70 many were not changable at all).

I've used this camera at home for taking pictures of my family, at soccer fields, and taking pictures of the neighborhood scenery: very happy with all of these.",01-08-2013,01-08-2013

casual glance. The D7000 has many features the D90 doesn't, including a true
mirror lock up mode - great for long exposure night shots to reduce initial
vibration when the exposure starts. (This can be done with a black reflector or
big hat, otherwise.)

If you like the D90 - you'll like this. It feels very similar in weight, build
and size. Not critical for performance, but the mirror of the D7000 is *much*
faster than the D90, giving the D7000 a very distinctive and sharp (not to be
confused with loud) shutter sound.

One of the best features in movie mode, is that you can use manual mode for
video. No longer do you have to endure the stepped increments of the auto-gain
of the D90. It still has the same rolling shutter problems, but that can easily
be removed with the appropriate third party software later. The addition of the
external mic jack is also appreciated. The focusing in movie mode can be made
constant, but is still sluggish (hunting) with even the best lenses compared to
a dedicated video camera. If you're serious about filming with this, it's
probably best done in manual mode.

I also like being able to set up the automatic timer mode on a tripod to shoot
an image every x time units.

For redundancy, you can have the two card slots act as a mirror of one another,
both holding identical copies of every file recorded. (A file level RAID-1)
Alternatively, you configure the camera to treat the second SD card as
additional storage. (Somewhat similar to a SPAN array but at the file, not the
block, level.)

Other than not recording uncompressed video (for which you'll pay a much higher
price) there's nothing I don't like about it. Sure, we could always use a
larger image buffer for continuous shooting, but for most work this is not
critical. The additional focus points are nice, but again not critical. The
added resolution over the D90 was welcome, but same goes for it as well. (The
D90 had sufficient resolution for even very large prints.)",01-06-2013,01-06-2013

Recently my wife really started to ramp up her photography and has taken a few classes which had her thinking about an upgrade. This was a great solution. She has the extra power she needs while no breaking the bank on a very high end model.
We were familiar with Nikon and assumed this would be an easy transition, for the most part it was, but I will warn you that it is not seemless. Case in point, it took a little internet research to figure out how to manually change the focus points. The learning curve has for the most part involved small features such as that, but when added up trying to take pictures right out of the box may take a little getting used to.
As far as performance is concerned the camera has been just what we wanted/expected and the second SD card slot has been a life saver.",01-01-2013,01-01-2013

An excellent choice for the learning photographer.,"I have to admit, after researching this camera I was nervous about purchasing this due to the many posts about focus issues, but after 1.5 years of using a d5100, I found that I really needed more accessible control to get to the next level.  I have a large investment in Nikon DX lenses so getting an FX camera was just not an option.  The new D600 has the ability to shoot DX, but it is far from ideal and the cost of the D600 body was out of my price range.  I also really have no need for a full frame, the cropped frame provides me with excellent photos.  When the price of the D7000 dropped to below $900 and with Amazon's awesome customer service, I knew it was time to buy.  If there was indeed a problem, I knew I could return it.

FIRST IMPRESSION:  Upon opening the box, I knew that this was exactly what I was looking for.  Although a little larger than my 5100, the buttons and dials and top display screen is leaps and bounds better than the 5100.  Finally...no menu-digging to adjust settings!  I charged up the battery and started shooting.  My first set of shots were taken with all the default settings in AUTO mode.  The result?  All of the photos were soft.  Disappointment.  Could I have gotten one of the ""bad"" cameras?  I wasn't ready to say that yet, besides, many photo gurus have touted the amazing quality of this camera.  I picked up David Bush's Guide to the d7000 and learned a bit on HOW the d7000 Autofocus actually works.  With a few changes to the settings and a bit more insight into the autofocus system, I was shooting tack-sharp photos within an hour.

DEFAULT SETTING CHANGES: The first thing you should do when you get this camera is change the JPEG image quality form NORM to FINE.  Then turn OFF the Hi ISO NR (noise reduction), which is degrades the detail in your shots in order to reduce noise, creating a softer image.  I choose to set the dynamic-area AF to 21 point which will help with speed (although I have to say this camera's focus speed is phenomenal compared to the 5100).  Use AF-C or AF-S.  This camera has 3 autofocus modes - AF-A, AF-S and AF-C.  I found that when I use AF-A, I tend to get more soft shots.  Once I move to AF-S or AF-C, my photos become beautifully sharp.

Finally, you really need to have a grasp of how your aperture affects you DOF (depth of field).  Using a larger aperture produces a very small DOF.  If you are relying on the camera to make these decisions for you, you may not get the shot you are looking for.  The camera may be smart for getting the correct exposure, but it doesn't know what you are thinking!  A good rule of thumb is to use at least f/5.6 - f/8 for portraits and make sure your focus point(s) are set on the eyes.  Set focus, lock and recompose if needed.  You will notice a significant difference in the clarity of your photos.  Finally, use a decent lens!!!  My Tamron 28-75mm 2.8 is a solid performer on this body.

MY RECOMMENDATION: I am by no means a ""professional"", but I do have a working knowledge of how to use a dslr.  If you are looking for a camera that you pull out of the box and expect perfect shots while set in automode, this camera is not for you...you are better off investing in a high end point and shoot.  If you know something about ISO, Shutter, Aperture, AF-S, AF-C, Metering and plan on growing that knowledge and want to rely on your ability instead of the camera, the d7000 is a gem at a great price.  If you want something in-between, consider the d3100 or the d5100.  Both of which are less expensive and are solid performers.  The d7000 is the perfect answer for those looking for easy access and control over their images.

MY OPINION:  While I'm sure there are d7000s out there that do indeed have a focus problem, I'm pretty sure that many of the complaints may be due to not taking the time to truly understand the camera and how it works.  While the autofocus is awesome, it is NOT perfect and requires the person to take control, which is the point of buying a dslr anyway, isn't it?  Just because it costs more doesn't mean it should excel at being a point and shoot!

THE BOTTOM LINE:  Don't be afraid of buying this camera because of the publicized ""focus"" issues.

****UPDATE****
I've had this camera for well over a month now and I can't tell you how ecstatic I am with it.  After getting comfortable with the camera and its controls, and learning all the sweet-spots on my lenses, I feel that this camera has pushed me to the next level in my photography journey.  I have been able to produce tack sharp image after tack sharp image.  I'm finding that I'm doing much less editing with this camera than I had with my 5100.  I think this is partially due to the camera and partially due to learning more and having the ability to easily control manual settings.  This camera will serve me for many years to come!!!!",01-01-2013,01-01-2013

Read the 326 manual to get up to speed on all the features that my old D40 and D50 lacked.  I really like the solid feel of the camera - heavier than my old cameras but not too heavy.  I do a lot of HDR work so this camera offers better ways to do that.  So far it seems to have less blown highlights than my old camera and obviously less noise in shadows.

One even had a ""cool list"" - which I found quite useful.

One of my other choices (and sent back) was the D3200 among others.  The D3200 to me was plasticy and almost toyish, and had [some] useful features.  They call the D3200 an entry level camera and they mean it.  We sat around comparing hundreds of photos between the D3200 and the D7000 the other day, and the D7000's results were night/day.  I mean, REALLY jump-out-at-you noticeable.  The D7000, even though about 6 megapixels smaller (24 vs 17?) ALWAYS produces better photos - especially when blown up.  We've done a number of 3' x 5's done using raw, and the final product is awesome hanging on the wall.  We asked the print shop about the 24mp D3200 files, and after they compared a few they overwhelmingly said go with the D7000's files.  His comment was something like ""yes, some of the cheaper cameras have a higher pixel count, but we noticed a lot of the pixels were duplicated and lacked color definition - they do that to use cheap sensor technology with the bragging rights of 24mp""

And finally, the D7000 is just loaded with working features that make it a very useful tool.  Sometimes you find a camera that meets all of your needs without breaking the bank.  It's design is particularly natural - everything is where you think it should be.  It does what you think it should do.  The only negative I have with any of these high-end cameras is there's no native wifi built in.  The add-on wifi thing for the D3200 doesn't count as it's much too hokey to be useful.  It's not really wifi - if you don't believe me go get one and see.  IMHO Nikon and Canon have really dropped the ball on 802.11, but they're probably thinking #1) they don't want to be in the networking biz and #2) It'll kill the battery life.  But get a grip guys - wifi is here to stay, and it's only a matter of time before you realize it and build it into the cameras.  Go ahead, be brave and beat the other guys to the market!  (the mem card/wifi combo can be useful, but they have their own issues as they are not native to the camera)

But the D7000 is a most capable camera.  The full-auto on this camera is so incredibly intelligent - it's hard to make a bad photo with it.  And when you want it to bend over backwards, you can modify it with manual controls in 10mil ways.  Pay the extra few $hundred and be done with it - you'll be glad you did!",12-26-2012,12-26-2012

One Caveat (and Fix) for People Pictures.,"Love this camera. If you are an enthusiast, this camera is a worthy upgrade from a D3100 or D5100; lots of buttons and dials for quick changes, two custom modes, tight and quiet shutter, viewfinder grid and virtual horizon, built-in flash commander mode, dual card slots, bright 100% viewfinder, and more. Love it. Love Nikon ergonomics.

Only one problem that almost made me return it: skin tones were terrible, especially compared to the king of skin tones, my trusty Fuji S5 Pro. With the same lens (the Nikon 17-55), I took some raw and jpeg pictures (raw ones processed in Lightroom 4 and Dxo 7.5) and compared them to the raw and jpeg ones from the Fuji. The D7000 jpeg were shot in the Portrait and Standard picture modes. The Standard mode was downright wrong: too contrasty and saturated (I used it for a couple of shots, just to test it since it's the default one). The Portrait mode was also bad: skin tones were a horrid combination of green, orange, and yellow. No pink. This is where I almost returned the camera.

Yet, I couldn't do it. I loved everything else about it. Did some online research and found out others were complaining about the same issue. One photographer recommended customizing the Neutral picture mode by shifting Hue to -1. That was good advice.

After much testing with wife and children as test subjects, I came up with a custom picture mode that gives me skin tones that I like (don't tell anyone, but I might like them even better than the Fuji ones, well, almost. My non-photographer wife still likes the Fuji colors better).

First, I use an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ExpoImaging-ExpoDisc-77mm-Digital-White-Balance-Filter-Neutral/dp/B0002GFOSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ExpoImaging ExpoDisc 77mm Digital White Balance Filter - Neutral</a>&nbsp;to get the perfect white balance for my jpegs (I also tried the Expodisc Portrait, but it's too warm for my taste). I know I could shoot raw and not have to worry about white balance for every shot, and I do shoot raw for income shots, but for family and friends shots, I shoot jpeg, and the Expodisc helps me nail the white balance every time (and it's really quick to set up on Nikon DSLRs). The Expodisc is expensive, but I'm a price maven and like to get my stuff used at a discount :-). You may also play with a cheaper alternative (ColorRight) or use auto white balance; the D7000 gets the white balance right most of the time, especially outdoor.

Okay, so here it is.

Custom Neutral picture mode (saved as Neutral1 because I have lots of imagination):
:: +5 sharpening (D7000 is soft by default). This can be changed to +4 or +6 depending on taste;
:: +1 saturation (D7000 skin tones are on the pale side by default);
:: -1 hue
:: -1 contrast
:: ADL auto (some recommend switching ADL off, but I didn't notice any color shift in skin tones with ADL off)
:: EV (exposure compensation) either on 0 (indoor) or 0 to -3 (outdoor). D7000 tends to overexpose outdoor sometimes.

Voil. Now I get the skin tones I like. Try it out. See if it works for you.",12-10-2012,12-10-2012

When I was shopping for this camera I compared it to an APS-C Canon in the same price range (7D maybe?), and also compared it with the Olympus OM-D E-M5 and the Fuji X-Pro1, both of which seem to have great reputations.

The Fuji was really, really, tempting but in the end I had read too many reviews on too many sites about strange focusing behavior and various other problems and quirks. The Fuji also lacked image-stabilization in the body or in any of the lenses available at the time. The Oly looked like a nice camera on paper but when I held it in my hands, it was a lot smaller than I expected and felt very light (I wanted a more solid feeling camera - just my preference). It also uses a micro 4/3 sensor which is noticeably smaller than the APS-C sensors used in the D7000 (and its corporate brethren). I don't know how much difference the smaller micro 4/3 sensor makes in real life, but it was just another nail in the coffin for the Oly for me.

The other issue I had with the Oly and the Fuji is that the bodies are so small that a lot of functionality is done via menus, and I HATE menus on cameras. I had an old Canon F1 film body for a long, long time and really like it. Built like a tank, no electronic menus - everything was run via buttons and dials. More recently I had an Olympus E-20 ZLR and it, too, offers much of its functionality via buttons on the camera body. I have used plenty of cameras with all the settings buried under menus and just can't stand that. So any camera that is menu-intensive is out of the picture for me.

I am the proverbial ""bull in china shop"" and am not as careful as I should be, so I needed a camera that would withstand me. The D7000 feels very solid and hefty and has a magnesium shell under the plastic exterior which helps make it more durable for people like me. The ""solid"" feeling reminds me a lot of the Nikon D300 (I've never owned one but have played around with a few at the local camera store) and the D300 is supposed to be a pro or semi-pro model.

The D7000 has plenty of buttons - ISO, +/- exposure adjustment, shooting modes (P/A/S/M/scene modes), spot/center-weighted/matrix metering setting, DOF preview, and a function button to which you can assign just about any function you like. There are about fix or six buttons vertically oriented to the left of the LCD on the back of the camera.

The viewfinder coverage is ~100% so pretty much what you see in the viewfinder is what you'll get in the final image - nothing is visible in the viewfinder that is cropped out in the final image and nothing outside of the viewfinder shows up in the final image.

The cameras shoots RAW, JPG, and RAW + JPG. I've never shot RAW before and can definitely tell the difference between RAW and JPG but when manually editing RAW files in Lightoom, I have a hard time matching the quality of the JPG straight out of the camera. I'll probably still shoot RAW + JPG for special trips but shoot mostly JPG for less special events.

The one bone I have to pick with the D7000 and Nikon is the infamous Nikon over-exposure issue. I had read about this before I bought the camera and so kind of knew I might run into it. I was shooting lots of pictures with blue sky and some with Lake Superior in the picture (either or both). I found that with any significant amount of water or blue sky in the picture, the D7000 is going to blow out the highlights at the metered setting. I used matrix metering to meter the scene in general, and I also used the spot meter to meter off of grass, rocks, pavement, etc. to get an approximate 18% gray metered value and still got blown (overexposed) highlights. If I'm shooting a scene that has grass, rocks, trees, flowers, etc. but no sky, the D7000 metered exposure is pretty much right on. What I found is that I have to set the the +/- exposure setting to -0.5 or -0.7 in most cases when overexposure is possible. This brings the highlights under control. I have the camera set to display flashing red color in the image playback to show me parts of the image that have clipped (seriously overexposed)  highlights and I have the histogram enabled too (it shows all three channels - R,G,B, plus luminosity) so I can see what channel(s) are clipping when I get flashing highlights on image playback. So an exposure adjustment of -0.7 or so usually tames the highlights.

The camera also offers an Active D-Lighting feature which helps bring the shadows and highlights under control when enabled. I was shooting waterfalls in MN recently and some of the waterfalls are in shady areas and/or in deep gullies, yet some sky is in the picture too. I underexpose (according to the meter) to keep from blowing out the sky (i.e.. having the sky get be  so overexposed that it is completely white and washed out) and then use either the Normal or High setting of Active D-Lighting to expose the shadows more so I get nicely balanced exposures. I have found that for my purposes, Active D-Lighting set to Low or Extra High doesn't help much - Low doesn't increase the shadow exposure enough for the shady areas around the waterfalls and Extra High is a little too much of a good thing.

Lightroom and Photoshop do NOT recognize Active D-Lightng in RAW files. All these are, really, are just flags in the RAW file that tell Nikon software to adjust the exposure curve. You can still accomplish this kind of thing in Photoshop and Lighroom by adjusting the curves and exposure manually and via masking, but if you want jpgs straight out of the camera that look good, I think Active D-Lighting and -0.7 stops of exposure adjustment work out great. I shot some waterfalls where the waterfall itself was in bright sunlight and there was sky visible above the waterfall, but the rest of the waterfall was in a ravine so the rocks and the area surrounding the water were in deep shadows and I was still able to get nice results using Active D-Lighting to increase the exposure of the shadow areas.

There is also a D-Lighting adjustment on playback in the D7000 (similar to Active D-Lighting but you can apply it to photos already taken - I think it only works on RAW files, though). It will apply exposure curves like what Active D-Lighting does so you can post-process images in the camera if you like. It processes the RAW file and applies the exposure curves and saves the results as a jpg (the original RAW file is not modified). You can also do some basic processing of the RAW files in the camera as well. Not as good as Photoshop or Lightroom but pretty good for basic adjustments.

The included software from Nikon for processing photos is pretty crummy and I'd recommend using Lightroom or Photoshop Elements instead.

I wish Nikon would display the histogram in the viewfinder while I'm metering rather than after the fact in the playback. That would prevent me from making so many test shots to see if I got the exposure I wanted. I don't know if anyone in the industry does that right now. All the manufacturers seem to find it easier to display the histogram on playback for some reason.

I have found that the auto-focus sometimes lies in low light. I was taking pictures of a building at night from a few feet away using a lens with a max aperture of f2.8. The camera would show that it had locked exposure but when I zoomed in on the picture in playback, it was clearly not sharp. Some of the pictures I took at that time focused OK and some were out of focus. I have read that digital cameras in general and this one in particular also can get confused in very low light shooting and tell you they have a focus lock when they do not. The solution to this problem for me was to switch to Live View mode, disable auto-focus in the camera body and on the lens, then zoom in on the LCD and manually focus the lens to get the subject sharply focused, then click the shutter button to take the picture. That worked much better. So be aware that as the sun gets really low in the sky or has actually set behind the horizon but there's still some light left, the D7000 auto-exposure may not work correctly. I always check my focus and exposure on playback after shooting just about every image. if you enlarge the image on the LCD in playback mode by about about 6-7 times (about one step short of where the image starts to break up into individual pixels), it's very easy to judge sharpness.

You can also post-process your photos, in the camera, to get three varations on a sepia effect. I haven't tried it yet, but want to soon.

Overall, I think this is a great camera. It beats any previous digital cameras I've had before. be aware of the over-exposure issue and be aware that auto-focus may show it is locked on in very low light when it really is not locked on.",10-30-2012,10-30-2012

Read several reviews how Canon does not provide pro like feeling when you hold the camera and there are so many options which you can manually configure which is not the case with Canon.

Do you want a DSLR with a large selection of very good lenses?  If so, it's either Nikon or Canon.  Leica's another category.  Next question.

Can you take excellent photos with either Nikon or Canon?  Yes.  Next question.

Are you currently invested in a selection of DSLR lenses, either Nikon or Canon?  If so, stick with that brand.  Next question.

Do you need one or more specific features that only one brand has?  Hard to believe, but, if so, buy that brand.  Next question.

So, how do you choose your camera?  Don't limit yourself to reading about the cameras you're considering.  Try them, or at least go to a camera store and play with them.  Touch and feel are big factors.  Really!  My personal experience is that I went to a camera store to buy a Canon T4i.  I decided on it, because it's less expensive, easier to use, and has a highly-reviewed LCD screen (i.e., I read about features that appeal to me).  Before I bought the Canon, I held it, looked through the viewfinder, pressed the buttons, and turned the dials.  Before I bought it, merely out of curiosity, I did the same with the Nikon D7000.  Bang.  I bought the Nikon.  The touch and feel varied drastically, for my taste.  Most importantly, the Nikon viewfinder is head and shoulders more usable and comfortable, and that's what I'm always looking through.  Also important, the buttons and dials work and feel better.  And, by comparison, the Canon does feel flimsy.

I haven't used my Nikon much yet.  Also, since I'm a novice, you may question the value of my opinion.  However, here's my experience with my Nikon.  It is larger and heavier, but not so much larger and heavier that the difference is a problem.  My Nikon feels study, and it's buttons and dials feel sturdy.  When I take a shot, the internals sound solid, with no shake.  It's an intangible that's difficult to explain, but is best described by two experts you can find on the internet.  One expert is Lori Grunin on CNET's website, where the Nikon D7000 is reviewed.  Her amorphous enthusiasm at first appears overly subjective, but turns out to be exactly true for me too.  The other expert is Ken Rockwell, who has his own website.  Everything he says resonates with me, and perhaps will resonate with you too.  For anything less serious than a full-frame professional camera costing much more money, the Nikon D7000 is his clear choice.  Why, again it's difficult to explain, except to say -- Try it, you'll like it.

One more thing -- about lenses.  They are a personal choice.  One of the lenses I bought is the Nikkor AF-S 50mm f/1.4G.  It is a full-frame lens.  The 50mm focal length is affected because the camera is a DX body (not full-frame).  However, the lens works perfectly with the camera body.  And the lens is excellent.  I took a shot of a sculpture in an outdoor sculpture garden, and the photo has the look and feel of art.  I took many shots of my grandchildren (using continuous shooting mode), and I can't fail to get a good shot, even indoors without a flash.  If you buy this camera body, I strongly recommend you consider buying this lens.",10-14-2012,10-14-2012

All reviews are subjective by the nature of the beast.  You may find problems in my appraisal of this camera, so take it with a grain of salt.

Cons:
Unless you are a professional photographer you will find the Nikopn supplied User's Manual (as usual) useless.  There are many excellent manuals/dvds on this camera, so don't worry about it.  My package arrived on time with the camera body.  Whether it is the fault of Nikon or the supplier, the warranty on the camera was missing.  If you have excessive patience and a high frustration capability you can try Nikon Customer Service.  Not me--I have tried. At my age there is not so much time to waste so I will cross my fingers.  If, like me, you need instructions I will be reviewing the aids later.

Pros:
This camera is terrific.  I began using a point and shoot digital about 7 years ago, switched to a wonderful Sony, and was so impressed by that I went on to a digital SLR Nikon D5100.  Great camera, but I wanted more control so the D7000 was chosen.
to say I am pleased is an understatement. Once you learn the basics this camera will do anything you want and things you never dreamed of doing.  I would like it if the LCD viewer moved like the D5100 but that ius something I am willing to overlook.  The durability of this camera is profound; take it from a clumbsy photographer.  The camera allows you control over everything from disabling the in-camera flash to ISO to shutter speed to white-balance to focus point and much more.  You can take beautiful pictures of any and everything.  I do a lot of macro and this is great!  Replace the Nikon neck strap and you are safe and secure.
I have read of people using the D90 (this camera's predecessor) for twenty years and I believe my heirs will ahve this for at least that long.
If you buy this wonderful camera and a decent manual for its functions, you can be a great photographer with a little practice.  I have had mine for only two months and am thrilled.  Good shooting.",09-27-2012,09-27-2012

But for the ""crop sensor"" shooter looking for great performance this is arguably the best option.
Technically its sensor is the highest rated (DxO Labs) but in practice I don't see dramatic or even noticeable differences in image quality between this or any other current DSLR camera.  They all capture great images.  What the D7000 does that sets it apart from lower end models is: 1). Meters & Focuses accurately and instantaneously and 2). Offers every conceivable adjustment at your fingertips.  There is no waiting around for 1/8 second for a focusing light to ""beep"" because depressing the shutter release handles that instantaneously.  And the ergonomics keeps digging into menus to a minimum.
IMAGE QUALITY vs. D5100 or D3100:  No difference.  At most its sensor gives you about 1/3 f/stop compared to the D3100 that I don't consider significant.
LENSES MAKE THE DIFFERENCE: A good ""walk-around"" lens would be Nikon's 18-105vr that gives good zoom range for most shots and delivers very good IQ with adequate light.  The best images can be captured with Nikon's 35mm 1.8G or their 50mm 1.8G.
CONS:  Size- It is bigger and heavier than a D5100 or Canon T3i.  For some the smaller size/weight could be an advantage.  Personally I miss the smaller size of the D3100 that I consider the best value in high quality DSLR cameras based on image quality, ergonomics and its Guide Mode for beginners.  Cost- The D7000 is an excellent value at its current price but the value shopper wanting to spend less might look at the outstanding D5100 body only (same sensor as D7000) or the D3100 with 18-55vr for just under five hundred dollars.  I have not used the new D3200 but the higher cost and pixel count (vs. D3100 or D5100)does not make it a better buy.  The D5100 is a better camera than the D3200 and the D3100 is the best bang for you buck.

Also i didn't not buy it from amazon as i buy pretty much every thing from here( sorry amazon)
not your fault, i don't really trust something over 1,000 getting delivered to my house.

I canot recommend enough how great this camera is. even to get started if you want to become a pro photographer and don't have enough money for the big boy cameras. trust me, this camera with.  before i bought it i must of seen over a thousand reviews saying that it was a great camera and don't buy it with the kit lens. well i went on anyways and bought it with a kit lens since i didn't have a lot more money to buy a pro lens. the kit lens is great to get you started with the camera, I'm not going to lie and say you don't need anything else because you do. i did a practice wedding shoot for a friend, (REMEMBER NEVER AGREE TO BE THE MAIN PHOTOGRAPHER IF YOUR JUST GETTING STARTED, YOU WILL RUIN THE WEDDING) well anyways, while the photographer they hired was taking photos of them getting married i was doing the same thing and trying not to get in his way. here is what i notice about the lens.

-First ---Inside a brightly lit church the lens will give you the photos you need. you might just need to bump up the iso a bit. and since i bought it with the 18-105 kit lens i didn't necessarily have to be in there face all the way. i can just stand back and take photos of them as well.

-Second--- remember when i said you can zoom in to get out there way? yea ones you start to zoom in the F stop will go higher REALLY quick. so you need to compensate on a higher iso because if you don't the pictures will either come out dark or if you don't have a pretty quick shutter speed there going to be blurry.

--third-- the camera made as much noise as the photographers 300s. take note when your inside a church and the priest is the only one talking that will be disturbing.....

--Fourth-- The picture quality with the lens was ok. I would not say professional. to an average person the the photos looks great but for some one who wants to strive but the best results to become a pro is not.

so the bottom line. i will completely recommend this camera with the kit lens. even if doesn't sound good. you will get better if you practice on the kit lens first and then when you go out and buy does expensive 2.8 nikon lens you will appreciated MUCH more.

one last thing. when you do buy lenses. i would suggest to but FX lenses. they work perfect on a DX body and ones you upgrade to a FX body the lenses you bought won't go to waste because if you buy DX lenses and then put them on a FX body it will still 1.5 crop your photos because its a lens made for a DX, even if your on that FX body.
they might be more expensive but worth it because the lenses are sure to last you longer then the body.

Yes, this is a very high-end consumer grade camera which has the same sensor as the Nikon d5100, but the layout of the settings, advanced capabilities, and user setting options will help you to understand how to effectively use a professional grade camera. As a professional photographer, I own several Nikon models such as the full frame Nikon d700 and often replicate the same image quality as my professional cameras. With that being said, its not always about the camera you use, the quality of the photographs you take depends on your knowledge of to properly use your instrument in different shooting situations.

Aside from learning the camera, the Nikon d7000 Can Definitely take professional quality pictures if you equip it with the proper lenses. Please research and gain an understanding of the difference between (fx) and (dx) lenses. If you are unsure about your future in the photography field or planning to upgrade to a full frame camera at some point in time, BUY (FX) LENSES FOR THIS CAMERA BODY. Although they are a bit more expensive than (dx) lenses, it will be extremely beneficial invest in an(fx) lens to prevent wasting your money on the same range of view on a professional model camera later on down the road. An (fx) lens on your d7000 will magnify the zoom on your content and also give you more sharp images. Directly investing in a higher quality lens may not be better for everyone's use of this camera, but can almotst guarantee to save you hundreds of dollars if you plan on upgrading to a full frame camera body. If not, you will still enjoy your camera with the smaller (dx) lenses.

SN# Some people mention a focus issue with this camera because they do not fully understand the camera. I have solved this problem with 75% of my assistant shooters by simply adjusting the viewfinder dial which is located directly on side of the eyepiece. If the viewfinder is not focused when you take the shot, it will not be focused when viewing it elsewhere.

It may go back a third time if the power fails again like it did this weekend.

On paper, this is one killer camera.  The frame rate is good enough for action/performances

The focus (if you get a good one or manage to get yours fixed properly) is pretty darned good, and compares quite well to other brands.  It's not quite up to D300/D700 performance, but in all but the dimmest light, it tracks quite well.  The color tracking, which incorporates info from the 2000 pixel meter, works a charm as long as you're not into the extremes of the color temp scale.

The buffer is a bit small, but the speed at which is writes to the memory card actually compensates quite a bit.  I'd say it writes to the card 50% faster than my D700, with the fastest cards I have around (45mb/s UHS-I SD and 90mb/s CF).

The shutter is incredibly quiet and there are things I can shoot with this that I wouldn't dare with the D700, because the mirror in the D700 is so bleedin loud.

This may have the best APS-C sensor I've used.

But at the end of the day, I'd really have trouble recommending this camera, simply because it took two repairs and months of testing/arguing with Nikon to get an appropriate fix.

If it came to me the way it is today, without the hassle I've been through, I might give it a full five stars.  But if you take into consideration the entire package including Nikon's customer service, and the time I've spend fussing with missed/OOF shots and sending the thing off, I have to deduct at least two stars.

I know enough to be able to diagnose the defects and was able to make images which demonstrated the issue for the repair department.  For the average customer who's not technically inclined or willing to deal with such a finicky piece of gear with manufacturing defects, it just isn't worth it.

First d7000 WOULD NOT FOCUS at all.  No doubt a product of the infamous ongoing focus problem they refuse to rectify. Returned it because after reading the horror stories other victims had with the infamous Nikon Rocket Scientists, I didn't want to go through that mess.  Got another d7000.  Took it home, charged the battery and guess what... DOA.  NOTHING!  The thing wouldn't even light up.  Nikon QA at its best.  Took it back because..... After reading the horror stories other victims had with the infamous Nikon Rocket Scientists, I didn't want to go through that mess.  Okay, they say the definition of insanity is doing the same idiotic thing over and over hoping for a different result....  I did the same thing a third time hoping for a better result, I bought another stupid d7000.  It WILL NOT FOCUS!  Makes you wonder if they are using Chinese Slave Labor for QA doesn't it?  Took the third piece of trash back and got my money back because.... . After reading the horror stories other victims had with the infamous Nikon Rocket Scientists, I didn't want to go through that mess.  But you know what I'm going to do...  keep buying them and keep taking them back for a refund until I get one that actually works and actually works properly.  I don't give a rat's butt how many I go through because it isn't costing me a dime when returning under 14 days at the least at some places and up to 30 days at others.  As long as Nikon chooses to put non-working d7000's out there I will be having as many of those non-working units going right back to them.  Maybe at some time they will get a clue and decide it might be better to put working units out there instead of unchecked, nonworking junk.

My suggestion, buy the thing but return it immediatly during the ""money back period"" if the least thing is wrong with it which according to Nikon's Track Record, it will probably have issues.  Force Nikon (through mega returns) to start a QA policy with the stuff going out their doors.  They can't run you through loops and try to make you pay for warranty repairs when you return the non-working junk under the ""money back period"".  That cost them money and when they see their refusal to do QA on their products is going to start costing them, then they might get a clue and start a QA policy.",07-25-2012,07-25-2012

This camera is cram-packed full of performance and features that put it punching well above it's class.

PERFORMANCE:
The most impressive thing about the D7000 is image quality; incredibly high dynamic range and color depth create crisp, punchy images that pull out incredible detail in the darks and highlights. ISO performance is also a good selling point; this is argued by many, but I find the D7000 can create usable non-distracting images all the way up to ISO 5000, and below 3200 the images are fantastic. The new image processor in the D7000 is great at giving the images a film-like grain under high sensitivity and does a great job of curbing the noise. The new color metering system is generally very accurate and adapts well to changing light, though it often over-exposes by about a 1/3 stop in bright sunlight. The Autofocus is very customizable and overall is impressively quick, snappy, and accurate. The 39 focus point selection is easy to use and comes in handy when using variable selection. Set to subject tracking, the AF is stunning and seems to know exactly what you are going to do - I commend Nikon here greatly. The viewfinder is huge for a DX camera and is completely accurate to the final framing (100% accuracy); it's also very bright with a well thought-out layout of information. Shooting is seamless and breathtaking; 6 frames per second and a great trigger are to help here. Video performance is strong, though not as strong as I would have hoped; don't bother with continuous autofocus as it's not useful. Battery life is very good on the D7000; I can go for a few weeks of shooting on and off before worrying about charging the battery (which charges quickly).

CONTROLS & FEATURES:
Nikon did their homework here; the D7000 has the best button layout/ergonomics of any SLR I've used. I can do nearly everything without going into the menu - in fact it's possibly my least used button on the camera. All major controls can be accessed with one hand with the exception of the ISO button being to the left of the LCD (the only major complaint I have with this camera's ergonomics). I love the lockable drive-mode dial under the shooting-mode dial; it's incredibly handy. The thing that struck me the most was how customizable this camera is; the menus are fantastic and very deep and you can save several shooting setups within the menus and on the control dial (U1, U2). There are many buttons that can be re-assigned and programed in many configurations.  The top LCD is a little small, but provides loads of information; I just wish it had an extra spot to show your ISO without replacing the remaining frame-count. The addition of the professional trigger from the top-guns of the Nikon DSLR range is great; I love the firm, but 'squishy' feel that gives a very accurate release point. Size and weight are good, but I wish there was more space for fingers (the optional battery grip fixes this issue). I am very glad Nikon decided to put in a dual-SD card slot, though CF would have been nice too... but really, I'm asking too much considering the incredibly generous feature list. The AF selection button located on the manual-auto lever is nice, but is a bit hard to reach.  The LCD is very high-resolution and offers good contrast and color for accurate photo-previews.

BUILD QUALITY:
The D7000 feels like a brick, and I mean that in the best possible way.  Nikon's choice to go for a chunky magnesium block for the frame was a good one; this camera feels very, very well made.  The seams and edges meet very nicely and the rubber surfaces are adequately grippy.  The control dials are also grippy and come in handy during hot days (sweaty hands).  This camera just oozes quality and thoughtful design; bravo Nikon!

PROS:
- Ridiculous performance/ features for the price
- Outstanding image quality
- Outstanding dynamic range and color-depth
- Sharp, contrasty images that render beautifully
- Great images up to ISO 3200, usable up to 5000; not bad for a veteran of the current DSLR market
- All around good AF system
- Huge, 100% accurate viewfinder
- 6 fps
- Great shooting modes and controls
- Very deeply customizable menus/controls
- Well thought out ergonomics and controls that just work. Period.
- Built like a magnesium tank
- Has many pro features from higher-end cameras

CONS:
- Small-ish in size (could be a pro if you like this)
- Overexposes slightly in bright sunlight
- Average video performance (not a bad thing, just not as exemplary as the rest of this camera's performance)
- ISO button needs to be near the exposure comp/ metering buttons (or at least on the right side)
- ISO range could be better
- Top LCD has no default spot for the currently set ISO
- Body-grip rubber could be grippier
- No CF slot, though dual SD is nice

Overall the Nikon D7000 has strengthened my faith in Nikon for delivering top of the line performance in incredible packages. If you're not ready for FX, this is the next best thing.",07-24-2012,07-24-2012

Since owners' manuals typically do a less-than-satisfactory job of explaining things, I also opted to buy a well-thought-out book complete with photos that show exactly what's being explained: ""David Busch's Nikon D7000 Guide to Digital SLR Photography."" It's a very helpful book.

There's so much to the D7000 that it's easy to think it's malfunctioning when the problem is really something else...possibly something as small as having programmed it so that it doesn't fire unless it's completely in focus. I personally LOVE this feature and intentionally set it this way. Others, however, may not realize that this feature even exists, or may have forgotten that they set it to operate this way. Thus, they press the shutter and...nothing happens. RATS! Missed the shot! This is not a camera malfunction; it's an operator error.

The D7000 takes great pics in all situations and has helpful features like exposure compensation; several metering options; depth-of-field preview; bulb setting (for long exposures); exposure, flash, white balance, and ADL bracketing; incredible choice of ISO sensitivity (use with care; high ISO levels can cause ""noise"" and less-than-perfect coloring), diopter adjustment (aids less-than-perfect vision through the viewfinder), and so forth...WAY too many to mention here.

I love the double card slots that can be programmed for various uses. And of course, the D7000 captures in NEF (RAW), JPEG (with choice of quality), and RAW + JPEG simultaneously.

With the D7000's countless other features, it will probably be quite some time before you have mastered this camera, so just relax and enjoy as you practice perfecting your skills.

The D7000 is an excellent choice for the photo enthusiast/semi-pro and there are pros who use it...it's that good. Can you get a better camera? Sure! You can buy a Daguerreotype Giroux for about $980,000 or more. But why do that when, chances are, the D7000 is MORE than enough to suit your needs.

BOTTOM LINE: I highly recommend the D7000. But whichever you choose to buy, LEARN THE CAMERA. Learn its various settings and what happens when you program it a certain way. And BE SURE TO BUY GOOD QUALITY LENSES! They are your BEST investment.

Check YouTube's how-to videos; buy books like ""Understanding Exposure"" by Bryan Peterson and ""The Photographer's Eye"" by Michael Freeman. LEARN! LEARN! LEARN! Who knows? You could end up selling your photos! Happy shooting!",07-18-2012,07-18-2012

1. LCD quality is low. You can not determine weather the shot was good enough or not. More often you think a shot was not good, blurry, noisy, whatever and in computer you find out that it was the best shot. The quality of the LCD screen should be improved.

2. In scenes mode which can save you so much trouble in some situations, you have limited control over the Flash. For example you want to take a self portrait with sunset in the background. The easiest way is to set the camera on Sunset mode and force-turn on the flash to lit the face. That's not going to happen, you can not turn on the flash and that's a big big issue. because then you have to go over the manual mode and adjust everything, iso, WB, A, S, flash and... most of the time it not possible to do the job right specially with the low LCD quality.

There's so much to learn about this camera and its capability. FYI:- I graduated from D40x and mind you that was an amazing camera for beginners and I had it for nearly 5-years and it did serve me well. Now that I'm finally ready to get serious with my hobby I can take it to the next level. I especially like the low light photography of D7000 where my D40x fell short several times.

I must say there's bit of learning curve to the D7000 if you are moving up from say D40x (like myself). D7000 is considered entry level professional camera (I think) even though it is a DX body...

I bough this camera mainly because I had my daughters 1st birthday last weekend. We had a party indoors and I did not want to get any bad pics because of the camera. I must say that I'm impressed by the pictures that I took they are significantly better than any I've taken with my D40x (I'm not bashing D40x but just saying that I'm glad I upgraded to D7000).

I chose D7000 over D3100 & D5100 since I was looking for a great camera not a camera+camcorder since we have 2 smartphones that take phenomenal video with enough clarity to play on our TV/Laptop/Youtube uploads etc...

Both the D3100 & D5100 compared to D7000 and marginal step above D40x (besides video). The myriad of features that D7000 has and its customization options are a definite plus..

D3100:- Besides being cheaper, lighter and smaller form factor there's not much to say about D3100 over D7000 as both are not in same league so to speak...So I eliminated D3100 right from the start...

D5100:- D5100 is pretty decent compared to D7000 but then again I think as a camera falls behind D7000. Few plus points for D5100 over D7000 are the in camera HDR & easy to use flip out screen + being thinner & lighter. Since I post process all of my pics at which point I can play with HDR toning using post processing tools. I can create HDR later and don't need in the camera also its hard to confirm that you got a great picture using the 3"" LCD screen so in camera HDR is not exactly a huge plus.

Any way these are only my first impressions so far. I will update once I use the camera for a while before I can truly see what wonder this cool camera has to offer...

PS: D7000 has in built auto focus motor (A REALLY REALLY BIG PLUS) for my existing 2 amazing non motorized Nikkor lenses. The price for a non motorized lens is much reasonable compared to the motorized from what I have seen so far.

---------------
Edit: 07/10/2012

What can I say after using it for little over a month, I've not regretted so far even for a minute. I can almost say that D7000 sometimes makes me feel like I'm a Pro after a bit of processing my pictures.

There's a bit of learning curve in terms of manual controls compared to D40x. However, the inbuilt functions do give you spectacular images just so you can use a great camera whenever there's a moment that has to be captures.

I still am using lenses from the ones I got when I purchased my D40x back in 2007. Also, last year I unknowingly purchased non compatible (non-motorized) lenses before (buying D7000). Now those lenses (mostly portrait lenses) are working perfectly with D7000 since it has built in motor. So suddenly my previous investments (in lenses) came to full life with little effort or not miss the shot of the perfect moment...
**Amazing step up from D40x in low light situation - one of my gripes with D40x besides being non-motorized**

Like many buyers I chose to ignore the negative reviews. My first purchase with the camera was the kit with 18-105mm lens. After hundreds of shots, only about 15% of them were sharp. I thought the problem were the lens. So, I returned the kit and bought a D7000 body, along with Nikkor 105mm f/2.8G micro and 85mm f/1.8G prime lenses.

After testing the new camera body with two new prime lenses, I discovered there was a serious back-focusing problem with the camera. The AF Fine Tuning feature in the camera is quite good. However, I needed to adjust -15 for the 105mm and -4 for the 85mm. Then again, the AF Fine Tuning does not solve all the focusing problems. Depending on the shooting distance, I would have to calibrate the AF again and again. So, the calibration is hit-and-miss.

Having trusted Nikon for 30 years, I believed I just had a bad batch twice in a row and I should still have a good chance of getting a good copy. So, I returned the camera again got another copy a few days later. To my dismay, same serious back-focusing problem still exist in the new camera. Then I did some digging in Amazon review (paying attention to the negative ones this time) and Googled more discussion forums to see if I am not alone.  Sure enough, many people had reported the same problem dated back in July 2011.

So, I returned the camera again and decided not to try another one.

In all fairness, I like the features the camera offers. The body is very responsive. The AF accuracy with the LCD Live View is extremely high (though very slow). However, the Phase-Detect AF system is a complete disappointment.

The best thing I got out of this experience is the knowledge I gained from testing AF and fine tuning it. So much information is available on Amazon and photo forums on this subject.  If you own a mid-range camera like D7000, you owe it to yourself to learn how to test and calibrate your camera with your lens collection. Based on my experience, having tried 3 copies without success, it's fair to me to give it a 1-star rating. A camera that cannot focus is not a usable camera on my book.  I will probably wait for the new Nikon cameras coming out this fall (if rumors are right).

With this writing, I am hoping all the buyers of this camera (or any camera) thoroughly test their cameras AS SOON AS they receive them. Do not wait until 30 days pass and you have to send them back to Nikon for service. If you pay for a new precise instrument, you expect it to work out-of-box. I chose not to send a brand new camera to Nikon for calibration because it's brand new! Plus, some people have reported same focusing problem even AFTER Nikon service center told them their cameras have been repaired. I am glad I did not need to go through that.

Hope this is helpful. Your feedback is welcome. Thank you!",06-04-2012,06-04-2012

My first camera was a Kodak Brownie in 1960-or-so, followed my a Nikkormat in 1964.

Since then I have had all kinds of film and digital bodies including Pentax, Nikon and Sony ultra-zooms.

I had several of the earliest digital cameras, starting with the 2/3 megapixel Casio OM models, the Sony F series (great cameras in their days) and a variety of Nikon DSLRs, starting with the D70, and including the D200/300. Never went for full-frame because I shoot events, often from the back of a theater or arena, and appreciate the extra crop that comes with an APS-C sensor.

But nothing, no camera I've ever owned, holds a candle to the D7000. Sometimes a manufacturer just gets everything right, and this is one of those times.

DUO CARD SLOTS

Having two SD card slots means never having to say ""I'm sorry"". I use 2 16GB cards and when one is full, the camera switches over the other - which is only one of the two-slot options. Another is using one for photos, one for video.

BATTERIES

Even before receiving my D7000 body, I purchased an extra battery and worried that I might need a third. Many of my assignments require more than 1000 shots and quite a few hours on the shoot. But I'm stunned: I've never yet had the battery run out and had to switch to the second battery! In fact, I've shot multiple events without recharging between events, something I've never even considered doing with any previous camera! I don't know how they did it, but it is nothing less than amazing. I'll never forget losing shots at a New Year's fireworks display when my battery died in the middle of the show! Will never happen with the D7000.

IMAGE QUALITY

What can I say - it's the best image quality I've ever experienced, film or digital. Because many of my shoots are at low-light indoor events, I always used f/2.8 lenses and often shot wide-open at ISO 400. Result: low shutter speed and many shots lost to motion blur and the tiny depth of field of a wide-open f/2.8 aperture. Now I shoot at ISO 1600, smaller apertures, and totally acceptable shutter speeds - and I get pictures that need little post-processing and make my clients very, very happy.

At ISO 1600 RAW, at a pixel level, there is a bit of noise. But it's like no noise I've ever seen before: it's so fine-grained and uniform that I can print without doing any noise reduction, or use just a hair of N/R to clean it up completely without sacrificing detail. Even my ISO 2500 shots come out better than my ISO 400 shots on the D200/D300! So impressive.

AUTOFOCUS

To be honest, I was a bit disappointed, at first, at the quality of the autofocus - it was very fast, but not always accurate. I did fine-tune the AF for my lenses, which helped. But one day, on a lark, I switched from single-shot to continuous autofocus (AFC), which I rarely used in the past (with the exception of shooting sports), because I was annoyed by the lag and the number of out-of-focus shots the cameras allowed.

But the D7000 is another story, entirely. I now shoot everything in AFC. It is thrilling to watch how fast the AF adjusts when you move the camera or zoom the lens - and I almost never miss focus on a shot, now. On top of that, you have predictive autofocus in AFC mode, where the camera calculates the motion of the subject and adjusts focus based on a mathematical calculation. The D7000 AF is faster and more accurate than any camera I've ever used. Bravo, Nikon!

OTHER PROS

The Viewfinder is immaculate, bright and offers 100% coverage. No more framing errors! No more side-cropping needed!

Video quality is excellent, though I don't use 1080p, since it can usually only be burned to Blu-Ray and my clients still want DVD presentation, so I stick to 720p. The results have been really excellent, though for best results, I recommend an external microphone setup (which I recommend for ANY serious video).

CONS

For my needs and tastes, this camera has very, very few cons. I find the two-hands ISO setting to be a bit of a pain and usually have to use the menu on the LCD to accomplish it correctly.

And I was a bit disappointed to discover that the artificial horizon, which I really need for stage shots, was only on the rear screen, and not in the viewfinder.

It's not a big deal to me, since I shoot video at 720p/30fps, but the 1080p video only allows a frame rate of 24fps.

All in all, the D7000 is the best camera I've ever owned, and its reasonable price just blows me away! I can't recommend it highly enough for anyone from a beginning DSLR user to a pro needing a second body and everyone in between. The move from the D300s to the D7000, to me, is a no-brainer.",06-04-2012,06-04-2012
https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D7000-DSLR-Body-Only/dp/B0042X9LC4?th=1,29,Electronics,Nikon D7000 DSLR (Body Only) (OLD MODEL),4.6,5,"If you didn't already hear, this is a great camera.","I've had a Nikon D40 for about four years, and finally upgraded to the D7000 in advance of a long trip I'm taking.

This review concentrates on what's different between the D7000 and the D40. That might sound strange since they're so different, but I think that it's a common upgrade- I bought my D40 to get my feet wet, took tens of thousands of pictures, and started bumping into the camera's limits on occasion, and learning to operate in those limits.

To compare the D7000 to the D40, first I will give you the 'cons'

-It's heavier and larger. You notice this when you carry it around. I could throw my D40 and kit lens in my bag and forget it's there.

-It seems more prone to having the memory card door pop open. It might just be me, and maybe my hands will get more used to it, but I seem to accidentally dislodge the door and the little rubber plug near the battery door on a regular-ish basis when I'm pulling the camera out of my bag.

-It's a little harder to set up. What do you expect? It's a lot more camera, and I don't do manuals.

-The battery is slower to charge, and doesn't seem to last any longer.

-The fancy AF system can be confusing if you're used to always using one point to focus and recompose.

These 'cons' could just be my whining at no longer having my trusty familiar camera in my hand, and having to learn something new again instead of concentrating purely on the images.

Some 'pros' compared to the D40:

-The low light quality is leaps and bounds better. I hesitated to shoot the D40 at ISO 1600, and now I am willing to shoot at 3200 with the D7000. Even 6400 can give nice shots, and the HI-2 (equivalent of 25,600) can give very usable shots if you don't mind heavily post processing them and only using them reduced to web sizes.

-The metering is noticeably better, so I have to adjust the exposure less, and have fewer blown highlights.

-The viewfinder is larger, so its easier to see what you're doing.

-The auto white balance has a much wider range of correction, and is more accurate. In difficult mixed indoor/outdoor lighting, I feel like I have a real shot at getting colors right with this camera. Even if the 'auto' isn't infallible, the adjustments are much easier to tweak, and have more range.

-The dynamic range is great. I'm not sure if it's the Auto-ADR or something else, but I have been getting some great shots. As an example, I have somebody indoors with a bright light streaming in from the sun outside, and nasty overhead lights, and I am now able to much more reliably get shots that show her face with a nice soft graduation of light instead of looking posterized.

One other thing to mention is that I've compared the D7000 to the D700 briefly, and I will say that the D700 still seems to be the superior camera. It feels better in the hand, the viewfinder is bigger, and you can read all over the internet about technical stuff that people will argue makes one better than another. In my eyes the D700 is better. Is it $1,000 better? Maybe, maybe not. If you're in the market, I'd say to go get your hands on both.

In closing, you may want to know if I am I getting rid of my D40. Heck no! I couldn't sell it for much anymore due to its age, but it's still reliable and makes great pictures.",05-28-2012,05-28-2012

I set manual for the settings when I turn away from the field and toward the cheerleaders who are in less light. So with an easy turn of the knob, I have all the right settings for the right situation. Having two slots for memory cards means I can set one to hold photos, and one to hold movies. Even when set to highest file size and optimal quality, I click off rapid fire shots of say a receiver as he is catching the ball. I am getting much better quality photographs now. I like being able to quickly and easily change ISO and shutter speeds for those evening games or soccer matches that are occurring as the sun is setting and lighting is continuing to change.

However, I just want pictures great out of camera. Moreover, there is a focusing problem with this camera which makes most of my shots blurred. If you are a d40 owner, looking forward to upgrade debating on d5000, d5100, d90, and d7000. I would recommend you go for d90 or d5000.

I did side-by-side test shots to compare the iso performance and the D7000 @ 6400 had less noise than D80 @ 1600.

The ergonomics of this camera is what sets it apart from all other cameras. I currently have the D3s and sold my D7000. Based on my experience with the D3s, I prepared a list of features that i missed having on my D7000:

1) No 1080p video. (D7000 has it)
2) No in-camera distortion control. (D7000 has it in the shooting menu as well as the retouch menu)
3) No ability to assign active D-lighting to any function button. (D7000 is able to do so)
4) In order to do any retouching i need to go the the retouch menu, choose the retouch method first, and then search for the particular photo i need to retouch!! In my D7000 i used to hit the OK button on any photo i'm viewing while in play mode and directly choose the retouch method which makes much more sense and is much faster.
5) Auto-focus is not faster than my D7000 using the same lenses! booo :(
6) Quite mode is useless. (better on my D7000)
7) NO custom settings mode. (D7000 had three!!)

It's worth noting that metering & WB accuracy is no better on the D3s than the D7000.

The reason i upgraded to the D3s is taking advantage of full frame in terms of superior iso performance. D3s also has more buttons and switches, and it shoots 9-11 fps.

So here you have it, I think this camera is perfect.

WAKEUP NOTE: Don't expect this camera to take better picture quality than other current models such as the D5100 or the older D90 or even Canon T2i or T3i. Picture quality is nearly identical for all the above! Whether it's 12MP or 18MP that doesn't matter.",05-15-2012,05-15-2012

Not as light as nikons d90 but thankfully not as heavy as the d300. I have no problems carrying this camera around.

Mount
Is plastic but the kit lens and other lenses I have fit firmly and securely onto the body.

Lens
Same as you would get with the d90. The 18- 105 I think is a great starting lens for beginners ESP. If you don't already have other lenses or obsess over various elements involved with photography.

Shutter
Very quiet and tested at 150k cycles which guarantees lots of picture taking for years to come.

User interface

Very user friendly and layout is similar to that of the d90.

I am a part-time photographer and I was in the busiest part of the Fall season. I got it and used it for a full day of mini-sessions. I was SHOCKED to get home and find out the camera had back-focused all day. Quick to blame myself I set out to do some careful focus tests with a tripod and chart. It was definitely back-focusing and a lot. So I had to send my brand new camera in. i was so disappointed. Thankfully the images were salvageable and I still had my D90 to finish up the season. It took over 3 weeks to get my camera back from Nikon and by then it was too late for 2011. However they did fix it and the focus issues are resolved. Now that they are, I am AMAZED by how fast and accurate it is. Ive really pushed it in low light, wide open at 1.4 and had great results. Im very happy with the camera now.",04-07-2012,04-07-2012

I've had it for a week and have barely cracked the surface of exploring this camera. So far I love everything about it. It's absolutely a huge step up from my D50.
The live view is a life saver when working with my new 85mm f1.4 lens. You can zoom in to make sure that you're tight in on your intended focus which is invaluable when working with such a thin focal plane. It's my intention to work mainly in manual with the 7000 and it's great to have so many external buttons to change settings rather than going through the menu, but when just shooting around it's nice to have something quick and top notch to get the job done.

I moved to this from a D90 and the similarity of controls was nice. This greatly reduced the learning curve.

I like the added pixels as compared to the D90. This helps when I do 22"" X 17"" prints.

However, when I did tight shots at F2.8 on both my main lenses - Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II AF-S Nikkor Zoom and the Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8G ED AF-S Nikkor Wide Angle Zoom Lens (These are both VERY good lenses.) I noticed the focus looked shifted back from the indicated focus point. Example: I set the focal spot on an eye and the really sharp focus was located several inches further back on the head.

Fortunately, the D7000 has an AF ""calibration"" function that permits you to shift the AF focus either closer to or further away from the camera (+ or - 20 positions) on both a global basis for all lenses or for each lens individually. I executed some tests and sure enough, I had to do a ""-4, global"" to get the focal plane to align with the focal spot on both lenses.

Much smarter than me!,"There are already extensive and excellent reviews of this camera on the site.  I just wanted to add a few thoughts from the perspective of someone who is not a pro but has been a serious hobbyist.  I've owned the D50 and D90 and this one blows them away.  The primary thing that I am impressed with is the Scene Mode shooting.  I have previously been someone who might fiddle around with adjusting EV to get a more saturated picture, or even tried to fiddle with white balance a time or two.  I often wound up shooting in P mode because I could make and keep my own adjustments.

This camera out-thinks me on every shot.  Shoot a landscape without putting it in landscape mode and it's fine.  Dial up Landscape on the Scene dial and it's more saturated with more dense colors--just a better looking shot.  Shoot indoors without a flash and into a room with at least 3 different types of lighting--halogens, incandescents, floods--and it perfectly balances the different light types--you can even see one light is slightly orange, another very white--and you still get great flesh tones.  I think my days of fiddling are over.  The scene modes think and work better than I do.

I love this thing.  It lets me get back to concentrating on the shot and making as good pictures as I can, rather than fiddling with technicalities.  Great work, Nikon.",03-11-2012,03-11-2012

The camera I have used before this is a Lumix GH2 which I like a lot. I have been using my GH2 to do professional work for clients with quite a bit of success, which is why I decided to get a D7000.

A lot of these reviews either echo what you can find on digicam review sites, or they compare it to other Nikon models. Why am I comparing it to a GH2? Because I own both and therefore I can, and I'm going to bet that there are people who are in the market for a camera and may be considering either the D7K or the GH2...so lets see how they stack up.

Camera Body Build
-------------------
In terms of ruggedness the D7000 has the advantage. Its magnesium frame (it's not made entirely from metal as some people believe) provides a high level of strength without adding to its bulk too much. It feels solid; the GH2 is entirely plastic and feels ""plasticy"", but it doesn't have a cheap feel. The GH2 does allow for a firm grip to prevent blurry photos. The D7K and certain lenses have ""weather sealing"" which help to keep dust and debris out of the camera and the GH2 has none of that.

The GH2 is a mirrorless micro 4/3 camera where light weight and compact size is intended. The lack of a mirror means there's one less fragile CRITICAL element that can break if the camera is dropped - despite having a rugged body, the mirror in the D7K can be damaged if the camera takes a good hit...almost like having an egg ""protected"" by a steel box, but no padding in the box.

For sheer exterior ruggedness the D7K wins, but the GH2 being lighter and not relying no a mirror means it can stand up to some ""minor abuse"" without damage.

Buttons and Ergonomics
-------------------
The D7K has a lot of buttons placed on the back and front sides of its body, plus a few on top. You might even say it has ""too many"" buttons. Much like a video game controller or keyboard, once you get used to the button positions you can quickly and efficiently change various settings on the fly. Things like exposure, ISO, white balance can be adjusted by holding down the appropriate button and using the selector wheel to set the desired option.

The GH2 takes a more advanced approach to feature management. While it does have buttons for common functions like white balance and ISO, almost all of the settings can be changed using the ""Q Menu"" button right on the screen. It also allows you to map the function buttons however you want (the D7K has this feature too).

One of the GH2's major assets is an articulating touch-screen LCD. While it may sound like a gimmick, you can easily set the focal point just by touching the screen. You can even take pictures by tapping the screen, and it will focus on the area you tap. Similar functionality on the D7K requires fiddling around with the focusing area and metering type buttons, and does not provide that level of flexibility.

Both cameras give you an amazing level of control over the pictures you take, but I feel that the GH2's approach is a lot more intuitive and fun. The articulating touchscreen is dearly missed and if the D7K had one, it would really unlock its potential.

Viewfinder and LCD Screen
-------------------
The D7000 has a higher resolution LCD screen, and it is quite nice, but it's not very useful beyond previewing images and changing menu settings. Taking pictures with the D7000 happens through its optical viewfinder.

In the past, I would have said that an optical viewfinder is a desirable feature, but in the age of digital cameras it is an obsolete element that should be phased out. The GH2 features an EVF (electronic viewfinder) which means that the image you see in the viewfinder is exactly what you will end up with after taking a shot.

The EVF in the GH2 has a higher resolution than the its own LCD screen as well as the LCD screen on the D7000, so it is very accurate and sharp...plus you gain the ability to see realtime info such as a histogram and exposure settings displayed while looking through the viewfinder. The optical viewfinder on the D7000 is ""full frame"", which means you are able to view the entire frame of the photo through the viewfinder, but it is dim compared to the EVF and the lack of realtime info means you have to either check the LCD screen or the digital readout to see what's what.

The EVF, along with the GH2's touchscreen capabilities give it a solid lead in usability, making it a very ""fast"" camera in terms of getting the shot you want without having to mess around with settings.

Lenses and Image Quality
-------------------
This is where things get dicey...and you may think it's a slam dunk for the D7000 considering that still pictures are really all it is good for, but that's not the case.

First of all, the POTENTIAL quality with the D7000 is much higher than the GH2. The D7K has a wider effective dynamic range in both brightness and color gamut, and the pictures it takes are very pleasing to the eye with minimal post-processing on the RAW files. The caveat is that you need a very good lens to get these results, and this is where you hit a conundrum with the D7000.

The D7000 is a professional-grade camera for all intents and purposes, but it has a DX sensor which Nikon decided to relegate to ""consumers"". This means that you have a superb camera body that is hobbled by a multitude of mediocre DX lenses. I actually didn't know how bad things were until I started looking for quality Nikon lenses.

With Nikon, the best current-model lenses are for the FX format and the bulk of them are in the $1000+ range. Quality FX fast primes can be $400 or more, and there is one ""pro grade"" DX lens, the 17-55mm f/2.8 nikkor, which costs more than the camera. I have the 17-55mm lens because it covers the most widely used focal lengths and is f/2.8 - so it's decent but not great in dim light.

What about fast DX primes? Sure, there are many DX f-mount compatible primes out there, even from third party manufacturers...but they all seem to suck wide open (softness, slow focus in low light, nasty chromatic aberration issues). These things are all issues I never had with the GH2 and MFT lenses, so I was taken aback because I expected that Nikon would have had it's game together considering its industry status.

Worst of all, Nikon seems to think that it's acceptable to sell lenses with PLASTIC LENS MOUNTS. Wow, really? Look I know cost-cutting is in but let's keep the lens mounts metal -- meanwhile all of my GH2 lens are solidly built and have METAL mounts. It's not a ""premium"" feature for the MFT lenses to be well-constructed so I have to say that despite the larger selection of F-mount compatible lenses that you can mount on your D7000, a lot of them are garbage that do not allow the camera to perform at its full potential.

The TL;DR of the above is that the D7000 has greater still-image potential but is hobbled by the mass of generally shoddy (aka consumer-grade) DX lens quality. Use of FX lenses on the D7000 is possible, but why? If you have the money to by FX lenses, get a FX camera...

The GH2 (or any other MFT camera) has a smaller selection of high to very high quality lenses at affordable prices, plus you can buy adapters that allow you to use just about any lens out there on your MFT camera.

Low Light Photos
-------------------
Taking pictures in low light with the GH2 and a fast prime lens works, but there is no comparison with the D7000. Even with a cheapo made-in-china 35mm f/1.8G DX lens, you will get better results with the D7000 by a wide margin. The D7000 has a sensor that is about 60% larger than the GH2's MFT sensor, and it is capable of yielding usable photos up to 6400 ISO. The GH2's low-light performance is respectable and you can shoot away at 3200 ISO to get similar results as the D7000 at 6400 ISO, but physics rears its ugly head and a bigger sensor with wider dynamic range and less noise spells a win for the D7000 in low light shooting.

Auto Focus
-------------------
DSLRs like the D7000 use a ""phase detect"" auto focus system, which works in conjunction with the in-lens ""CPU"" to gauge distance to subject, which allows for a subject to be tracked in motion with focus maintained. On paper this sounds nice, but in reality most photographers are still using an anticipatory method to pre-focus on an area where they believe their subject will end up to get nice motion shots.

The GH2's ""contrast detect"" AF system was once regarded as an inferior method since it lacks the D7000's tracking capability (due to lack of distance info), but it is so fast that it hardly matters. Using the same anticipatory method along with the GH2's touch screen shutter release, you can take shots of fast action ""just like the big boys"".

Low light focusing is slower on both cameras, and both use an AF-assist lamp, but I feel the GH2 does a better job of locking on consistently in low light shooting vs the D7000.

The GH2's AF system is blazingly fast and I can't recall ever losing a shot due to its AF. The D7000 has cost me a few shots due to its AF system's questionable subject selection. It's also worth noting that some lenses focus a lot slower than others on the D7000, whereas most MFT lenses have quicker average AF response times.

Video Recording
-------------------
This is one area where the GH2 has no real competition (to date) - it was and still is hands down the BEST video recording device under $2,000. The D7000 can record at a maximum of 1080p @ 24 FPS, while the GH2 offers both 1080P @ 30 and 24 FPS. The video quality produced by the GH2 is noticeably sharper, and since both cameras use contrast detect AF for video, the GH2 is able to focus much faster and more accurately during video recording. The built-in mic on the GH2 is stereo and very good quality; the D7000 has a mono mic built in with average sound quality.

I would not bother using the D7000 if video recording is my main objective, but it can shoot video in a pinch.

Conclusion
-------------------
It is nice being able to do a head-to-head comparison, largely based on how I use both cameras personally and professionally. I really like my D7000 and I am not disappointed by purchasing it...but I do feel that Nikon needs to realize that not all pro photographers want or need a full-frame camera, yet they do want professional-quality DX options.

The 17-55mm Nikkor lens was a start - it's basically a set of primes in one, albeit f/2.8 max. It's a great, sharp lens that lets the D7000 take some incredible pictures (obviously superior to the best photos I've taken with my GH2)...but then you have junk like the all-plastic Nikon 35mm f/1.8g prime which doesn't really get good (in terms of sharpness and general IQ) until you stop it down to f/3.5 or better - sort of defeating the purpose of a fast prime.

With that said, if I had to choose ONE camera between the GH2 and D7000 it would be the GH2. The reason quite simple: The GH2 doesn't get in my way at all; it lets me take the pictures I want to take the way I want to take them and I have no gripes about any of my MFT lenses - they all work as intended.

The D7000's superior still image capabilities really only shine when using top-quality (read: expensive) lenses intended for FX format cameras. I cannot give this excellent camera any less than 4 stars, but I cannot give it a 5 star rating due to the major quality discrepancy between the D7000 camera and available DX lenses.",02-24-2012,02-24-2012

I bought a D7000 slightly used (under 2k actuactions) off the FredMiranda forums after selling my Canon 40D and was extremely excited to get a new camera of the quality I had spent weeks researching. Low light performance was my #1 priorority and the d7k was the best in the price range.
So finally, my camera arrives. Box looks brand new, body looks absolutely flawless and it was, in fact, under 2k actuactions. AWESOME!
Within a few days, I noticed that it would give me random errors writing to either of the Sandisk EXTREME 16gb class 10 cards. The camera becomes unusable until you pull both cards and the battery. Not only that - but the image you were trying to shoot whenever you get the error - is gone. Doesn't exist. Great, as a concert photographer - you get 9 minutes to shoot images - and I'm spending a 3rd of that time now pulling my memory cards and powering down so my nearly brand new sub-par Nikon can continue to shoot.
I lived through that until this weekend, when about every 10th image now gives me an error and requires the cards to be pulled/etc. I e-mailed Nikon right away with this problem when I started receiving it, and they told me to send it in and pay them to service it.
Yes, you want me to pay you to fix a camera that has been defective since the day it was shipped from your factory? Not only that - you want me to be without a camera for 6 weeks while you diagnose/fix it. I've tried 3 different brands of class 10 SD cards and still get this error - along with lots of other people who made the mistake of buying this body.

My friends D90 starter kit wowed me and that is what initially propelled me into photography. Anyways I eventually saved up enough and purchased the D7000 starter + 50mm 1.4 + 35mm 1.8. I definitely was disappointed when I took my first picture. I was like WTF? And of course the glass you use can make a huge difference in quality of pictures. 50mm 1.4 and 35mm 1.8 are not top notch lenses in this world but they are very capable to capture amazing quality pictures. Any lens I used seemed to make the pictures soft. I also notice a lot of purple fringing on my subjects. So to make sure I am sane and not talking due to user error, I compared pictures of my friends D90 + my lenses and wow... oh well life isn't fair and it blows. I was in denial for the longest time until I read others people review and it hit the spot on how I felt. Hmm...now what to do? Guess I will ""try"" and see if Nikon will fix it.",01-31-2012,01-31-2012

Performance in low light is superb.

Build quality is as good as professional level DSLRs.

Custom mode dial is very useful.

Small changes in layout from D90 are great.

Infrared thingy on the back makes using the remote easier.

Cons:

Video auto-focusing is a marketing gimmick and just does not work in real world situations. In addition, the mic picks up the AF sounds and it is very loud. You would have to use a mic off-camera. I even bought an on-camera directional mic, but it still picks up the sounds to the point of being useless. But the audio issue is a moot point really, as the video AF is of little use. Nikon should focus on competing with Canon for video market share by matching Canon's bitrate and framerate levels rather than by touting video AF. Pros don't use video AF anyway.

!!! The lack of a recording indicator light on the front and little indication on the back means you will have no idea when the 20 minute recording limit is reached when using it on a tripod without someone behind the camera. If you are planning to use the D7000 to record family gatherings, you are going to be frustrated and disappointed. I actually missed the first laugh of my infant son because I thought it was recording, but it wasn't! A simple light and a beep when it is done seems like a complete no-brainer and I can't imagine why Nikon did not include this feature on this or the D7000.

Included software is not very good. Okay, Nikon's software sucks. It is a complete mystery how they rationalize charging $200 for a half-baked remote capture application (Camera Control Pro), when Canon includes something better for free! I scratch my head a lot when thinking about Nikon's strategies.

Check your camera for backfocusing before the return period ends! This is widely reported, but Nikon has not owned up to it. I had to send mine in for service for a severe backfocusing problem. The entire service experience ranks up there with my Worst Nightmare Experiences Ever. Nikon's Customer Service is bad, bad, bad- infamously so. I won't go into the details here, but let's just say I came very close to selling my Nikon gear at a loss to switch to Canon. But they just make such darn great cameras!

Final Analysis:

The best prosumer DSLR Nikon has ever made. It's class performance is second to none. Video looks great but is frustrating to use without an indicator light. Backfocusing problems should be checked for right away. If this is your first camera and you are considering the Nikon/Canon question, ask yourself how important customer service is to you. Canon=good, Nikon=bad.",01-23-2012,01-23-2012

So thought I am a newbie again in this camera, so started using ""Auto"" and ""Aperture"" priority for almost a month. In that whole month, never took a single ""wow"" photo. All pictures are either ""soft"", as if it has been washed out or don't know where the focus is. Or when a group picture is taken, everything in the backend is super sharp, but not the people in front. Or if I take a very close up shot, with single focus definitely focused on persons eyes, all his/her hairs will be in super sharp.

All my big lenses are junk in this case. Tried all kinds of settings, ""Autofocus fine tune"" in the camera, adjust ""exposure compensation"", ""AP-S""/""AP-C"", ""focus lock"" .. nope, nothing worked.

I originally gave the product 4 stars for features.  Now, I'm lowering the rating to 1 star for Nikon's service and support.

I want to provide a review for shoppers that will assist them in determining if the features of the camera are right for their needs, based upon my hands on experience.  I also want to paint an accurate picture of the quality that I have experienced.

I have had problems with large glowing white'ish colored dots showing up randomly throughout my images.  My sensor is failing.  Wow!  That's not good.  Currently, Nikon has my camera.  When I get time, I am going to post examples on my personal website.  Hopefully Amazon will allow me to link to those images.

Based upon my experience, you can expect to send this camera in every 3 months to have the sensor repaired.  You will have to pay the shipping and be inconvenienced.

Bottom Line:
I will not buy another Nikon product.  That's not because I think they are all bad.  Sure, you can get a lemon with any manufacturer and even the best companies will have an occasional problem.  However, how they treat the customer when problems do arise makes the difference. So, do yourself a favor and buy something another brand.

Disclaimer:
Prior to owning this camera, I owned a Canon 60D.  Not having owned any other DSLR's, the 60D is my single point of reference.  So, you might want to factor that into my review.

About the features:
I was looking for a camera to shoot indoor sports in very low light.  A full frame camera would have been even better.  But, I couldn't justify the cost.  I am using this for family photos.

When working, it has good high ISO performance and focus pretty well in low light.  These two features were very important to me and the reason why I bought this camera.  When shooting low light sports indoors, you need these features.  I have had some shots outdoors in plenty of light where the focus was so far off that I was left wondering, ""what the heck was the camera thinking????"".  You could blame me for the out of focus shot.  But, in this specific case, I was using center focus aimed directly at my subject.  There was really no room for human error.  The camera simply goofed.  However, if that's not something you plan to do, I see no other compelling reason to choose this camera over any other camera.

I find the menu system of the Nikon to be fair.  I like the Canon better.  To switch auto-iso on and off, you have to navigate through the menu system and then click a few times.

I prefer the Canon for the buttons and the way you access shooting modes.  I also like the fold out screen on the Canon.  Before purchasing a DSLR, I owned a point and shoot with a flip out LCD.  I really liked that.  I wish the D7000 had a flip out LCD, too.  It makes self portraits (like you and friend) much easier.

I think the image quality is quite good.  If you don't mind buying Adobe Lightroom, *sometimes* you can get usable photos with ISO's up to 3200 and 6400.  Honestly, I don't know if I've tried an ISO higher than 6400.  The amount of noise associated with higher ISO seems to be dependent upon the available light.  If you have decent light, higher ISO's don't seem to introduce as much noise as the same ISO in worse light.  Don't expect all of your high ISO's to come out looking sharp.  Once you get up in the range of 3200-6400, you will always want to do some noise reduction with post processing.  In the 800 to 2800 range, you're probably going to want to clean them up with post processing, too.  But, at those levels, depending upon the circumstances, you may not have much clean up to do.  FWIW, Lightroom's noise reduction works far better than Aperture's.  Apertures's is rather poor and brings my macbook pro (late 08 model) to a crawl.

Shooting....the frames per second are not quite adequate for my needs.  The buffer is too small.  So, I don't get too many shots before you have to stop shooting and wait on the buffer to process some of the images.  I have to pace myself.  The Canon beats the Nikon here.  I like that the D7000 has a fine tune adjustment for lenses that consistently front or back focus.",01-17-2012,01-17-2012

In any case it is a very very nice camera with more features than I know how to use. My previous camera was a D70 so it was a bit of an upgrade. If you are just going to buy a couple of modern zooms such as the 18-200mm VR or the 18-105mm VR or only lenses with built in focus motors then I would buy the D5100. But if you are an old guy like me who is used to film cameras then the D7000 is really great with the older manual focus lenses. I have a nice Vivitar series one zoom (version 3 by Komine) and it works very well with the D7000. I also have the Nikon 16-85mm VR and the Nikon 70-300mm VR but I think aside from these two I will use older AIS lenses since they are available for very reasonable prices. I don't really mind manual focus vs AF but I do like VR since when you are older you can't hold the camera as still as you would like and you miss too many shots if you have to set up a tripod. All of Nikon's dslr's take nice pictures but if you want the maximum selection of lenses then buy the D7000. The D7000 also has many features that I still need to learn about since I have only had the camera about a month. I used to have a Nikon 18-105mmVR that was stolen along with my D70. In spite of it's plastic mount which many people don't like, but it took very nice pictures. I am a big fan of modern digital cameras but I don't like the point and shoot cameras. If my budget was very limited I would buy a good used D40 and the 18-105mm VR which would take way better pictures than any point and shoot. In any case I was very surprised how well the D7000 works with older AIS lenses which is something not mentioned too much in the other reviews. This is something to seriously consider when deciding whether or not to buy the D7000.  I also considered an FX camera but with an FX camera you start spending too much money for just a hobby and the D7000 takes very nice pictures that will make the great majority of users very happy. Also the high ISO of the D7000 makes up for not having an FX to a great extent. The only thing the D7000 lacks is built in VR which would be a useful feature as many lenses don't have it. Built in VR is the one thing that might tempt me to upgrade from the D7000.  Update:  I've been looking at the reviews of the new Pentax K5. It seems to have the same ISO performance of the D7000. By having a built in anti-shake mechanism you can save quite a bit on lenses with the K5. For example the Nikon 70-210mm F2.8 VR costs more than the K5 and the Tamron 80-200 F2.8 put together. If the D7000 had built-in VR you could save well over a thousand dollars on one lens alone. I guess Nikon wants to make money selling VR lenses.",01-15-2012,01-15-2012

They promised an ETA that came and went, and nobody at Nikon seems to be able to tell me what is going on.

This camera, while likely fine for a beginner, will be more helpful for a more advanced photographer who can grasp a lot of its features. It has multiple ways of tweaking options and camera functions.  It has two user customizable modes that allow you to reliably reproduce your favorite camera setups with just the twist of a mode dial.  There is a user customizable ""My Menu"" feature so you can find you most often used options, like for instance Auto-ISO (which adjusts the ISO so your shutter speed never falls below a preset that you have set).

The D7000 is a revelation in High ISO performance compared to my D200; even with pixel peeping, well exposed ISO 3200 pictures take minimal chroma noise reduction to look extremely clean.  I think this D7000 is at least 2 stops better than my D200 and at least 4 stops better than my Canon S95 point and shoot. Related to this, it has great dynamic range when shot in RAW.

Autofocus and flash performance are excellent as far as I am concerned.  It has a wireless flash commander mode, which is very useful for speedlight owners.  The Nikon flash system is quite excellent and flexible, I find.  Couple flashes with the excellent higher ISO performance, and you can really maximize what you are able to light with flash.

The body itself seems well built, though there is a bit of flex in the hand grip portion.

Minimal complaints, other than the grip flex and perhaps the metering blows highlights a little too readily.

I use a custom Standard ""SD"" picture control with the sharpness and saturation jacked up a bit for landscape, and a slight boost in the Neutral ""NL"" sharpness and contrast for shooting people/landscapes. There is lots of capability to modify existing picture controls or create custom one to match your preferences.

I admit to having very high hopes for the low light capabilities of this camera and in most ways it lived up to the hype, taking very usable images at iso 3200 in near darkness.

I used it for about 3 months off and on for some bar photography and 2 weddings as well as just fooling around with it.  In low light it focused very quickly and I was very happy with everything except especially the improved flash metering (metering in general actually, you often have to baby sit the d700 meter in tricky light if you use it).  Unfortunately when I looked at the images on my computer it seemed like most of them were WAY too soft for a fast prime.  I calibrated all of my lenses on it and tried my damnest to fix the issue and upgraded to the most recent issue but it still SEVERELY backfocused in about every third shot or so, just enough to keep the subject from being sharp enough.  I noticed it was worse with my G series pro lenses, my old 85 1.4d seemed to nail every time though.

I could have sent it into get fixed but my biggest problem with the camera was the flexability of the raw files and dynamic range at high iso's.  At 3200 if it didn't nail the exposure the photo was ""difficult"" to save and the resulting image would always lose way too much detail and smooth tonal gradation.  I already knew i was spoiled by the d700 but the specs said it should have been better than it was.

It is a very good camera, but I agree that the focusing issues with this camera and the i guess, ""quality of the noise pattern in the raw files at high isos"" prevent it from being an acceptable backup to my D700, the D300 is still just more convenient and excellent at low iso.

I've been doing weddings and bridals for about 5 yrs and loved my d80, it did everything I needed, so I thought.  After spending hours online comparing advantages and cost versus the D80, D300 and d7000 and the d700, I finally took the plunge and got the D7000 (I also do events and wanted the Hi ISO).  This camera is so much more than Higher ISO!  It is...Fast.

For lack of a better word, Fast means everything happens so fast it makes shooting more intuitive.  The higher ISO has changed the way I shoot because I can turn off my sb-800 speedlight and just use natural light.  In the past, i wouldn't dream of attempting some indoor or evening shots without a flash and umbrella or other diffuser.  But now, low-light images are no longer a ""risky"" shot and they turn out beautiful every time.  (Yes, I rely first on good glass, from f/1.4 to 1.8 in primes and the $$$ lenses,  70-200 Vii 2.8 and 24-70 2.8).

The change in how I shoot was more pronounced than I ever thought.  A few reviewers said the advantages were negligible, so i was pessimistic about trading in the d80.  After using the d80 as backup to the 7000 in the real world, i eventually had to sell it because switching between the two is SUCH a drag, it annoyed me, they shoot so differently.  (not to knock the d80, it WAS a great camera).

If you are on the fence about the benefits of a DSLR body with fancier insides, just try it and you will feel the difference.  I learned early on to spend more on my glass than my camera bodies, but the move from D80 to d7000 was worth every penny.",12-10-2011,12-10-2011

The camera body is not up to D700 but sturdy and solid enough.
The high ISO is much better than in D90 , it's up to D300 level or so.
Focusing feature has been dramatically improved. 35 points - not a joke!
2 SD card slot - very helpful. I'm using a back-up option during a wedding shoot.
I wish d7000 was a full frame camera but you can't ask for any better camera around 1000 bucks.

Update 12/6/11,"I got my copy of D7000 early Sept 2011.  I couldn't wait to start taking pictures to see the results since I upgraded from Olympus E500 system.  The camera performed outstanding, and didn't have any focus issue like some users experienced. Pictures were great with 18mm-200mm VRII lens and I also bought 35mm f/1.8 lens soon after. About couple weeks ago my friend forward me a concern about possible oil splash/spot on the D7K censor that his friend experienced.  I checked my pictures and told him I don't have the problem.  But after my most recent trip to Mammoth Lakes I noticed 3 small greyish transparent spots at middle toward top third of the pictures while shooting at f/8 or higher low-mid zoom against clear blue sky.  I checked my lenses and they were clean.  I air cleaned the camera chamber to blow out the possible dust.  But the dots were still there at the same spots.  I searched online and found it's an issue with many D7000 owners and a problem that Nikon has yet to acknowledge.  I want to know if other users have same issue or not at Amazon.com.  I am a little unhappy with $2k system that has a possible oil splash issue.  Lowered my stars to a 3 and waiting to see how Nikon USA responds to my email.

Update:
I found out it's not oil, just dust, now just trying to figure who and how I am going to clean the dust.  Read both dry and wet methods.  Some people recommended have it done professionally.  Need some input.  In the mean time I just have to not turn up my F stop.

One hell of a camera it is, I loved it. Later when D7000 came, I have been reading reviews and hearings from friends that it has lot of potential and significant upgrade over D90. After too much of thinking i decided to go for it. ordered it and made one day prime shipping coz I cant wait to hold this bad boy and shoot it to its potential. But to my disappointment, I dint feel it at all from the moment I took the first snap out of it. Soft images, Memory Card error (ordered brand new 2 memory cards with camera), washed out oily images on occassions. I wasn't feeling at all and I realised as I read in many reviews for few users, they recieved the faulty unit like mine. Amazon is awesome, they have excellent return policy. Leave all that, after too much of thinking when you finally get to hold the camera, you really wanted to have a faulty one and have to struggle through all that returning. I cant even exchange as this is in high demand and all ran out of stock in few days after I ordered this. I need to wait until stocks are loaded up again. Now I lost my interest in D7000 and made me think to wait for D400 (reading rumors but not sure). Nikon needs to do more robust QA on the products. I am not blaming the product but the company.

When I get the perfect piece not the faulty one, I will re-write my review with updated points.

UPDATE:

Sad to give this update that still has not found defect free D7000 yet. After the original review I returned the camera and was looking for replacement but to my luck Amazon is out of stock. So got the refund and bought one from J & R. So unwrapped it and started firing away and learn many things that issues I noted above are not with faulty piece but with all the camera's.

-  Washed out / Oily / over Exposed Images under bright conditions. In general this new sensor/processor is over exposing constantly all the time that it washes out details under bright condition. It was not the case with D90 (one beautiful camera it is, i sold it :(  ) ...I have to always look for this wash out situations and adjust exposure value 2 stops down or more

- Memory Card Error. This was really annoying. Thought its defect with few pieces but its not. The new piece had the same problem. On trip, I set to shoot RAW on one card and jpeg on another. All general ppl shots suffice to be compressed jpeg, easy to share right off the trip. And RAW images are things which I do part of photography, like any landscape scenes etc., because of this error all my RAW and jpegs got mixed up in the secondary card.
Later Nikon had released the latest firmware 1.3 and it had the fix for that.

- On occassions still i see, soft images (be little careful and you can avoid this in many situation)
there is setting in the camera for Shutter Release ""Release"" & ""Focus"".  What does ""Release"" priority do is, regardless of your object is in focus, it release the shutter. Useful for sports photography (they cant miss the moment, during continuous shots if camera is trying to Auto Focus, also it slows down 6 fps on such occassions.
So camera comes with ""Release"" setting by default. Change it to ""Focus"" priority, no matter what until the desired object is in focus it doesnt release the shutter. So no chances for soft images.

THE NEW QA DEFECT:
Again I am returning this piece because it has hot/stuck pixel on my LCD screen (not on sensor). Once you notice, its really tough to ignore it from that moment. Its annoying though its tiny and tinier that this . dot. I can get used to live with it, caveat is it may develop more in the future and cant be acceptable for the price of the camera. i have tried all the ways to fix the hot pixel and not going away. I feel have NO LUCK with D7000.

What I still love about the camera and want to hold it:

- Colors ! Colors ! Colors! are simply real
- Fast AF system.
- Better User Settings.
- Pictures just come alive and feels so great with lenses like 24-70 f2.8
- Weightless and Ergonomically awesome.
- Portraits are way to go !! after post processing ppl think I am a PRO and GOOD TO START my portrait business (but in real I am not that pro like)

I wish I understand this camera more to work around the few defects .. or just work great like predecessors. May be I am thinking buy used D90 for now until they release D400.",11-22-2011,11-22-2011

There are a couple of negatives I noticed right away. On the D90 in single point focus mode I could look at the top LCD display and see which one of the 11 sensors I was using. Then if I wanted to change it I could do so with out ever having to raise the camera up. On the D7000 the top LCD does not show this information, and you have to look at the rear display mode to find out. Another change I'm not happy about is the ISO-Auto feature, (this is not the same as Auto ISO). On the D90 I could add ""ISO Senitivity"" to ""My Menu"" and I had complete contol over the menu including the ISO-Auto feature. This is really handy when taking pictures at a show and the lighting is changing every second. On the D7000 I added ISO Sensitivity to ""My Menu"" but now I can only turn ISO-Auto on or off. On the D90 I could adjust the minimum and maxium ISO and shutter speeds, on the D7000 I can NOT. This is a major pain, b/c now I have to hunt down the menu item everytime I change lenses to adjust the minimum shutter speed. For professionals this might not be a big deal, they just switch cameras, but for the enthusized this camera is aimed at, it's a pain. Something else I noticed was that on the D90 I could change the recording folder name, but on the D7000 I can only change the folder number. For instance, on the D90 I could make a folder that said SHOW, GRAD, GTOR, etc, then when I went home I would know what pictures are in that folder. On the D7000 all I can do is change the folder from 100D7000 to 101D7000, 102D7000, 103D7000 etc. I'm sorry but 102D7000 doesn't tell me anything about what's in that folder. This might not be the correct place for it but the optional battery grip is also not as good as the D90's. On the D90 two batteries where in the grip and no batteries were in the actual camera itself. On the D7000's grip there is only one battery. On the D90 I could kill a battery, pop it out and put in a new one. This made it easy to rotate thru my batteries, now in order to remove the camera battery I have to completely remove the grip. I'm worried that one day I'll kill my grips battery and the camera battery will be dead too, b/c I was in a hurry and didn't have time to change it.

There are not a lot of real positives that I see over the D90. True it has a 16MP sensor, 39 point autofocus system, expanded ISO range and a faster frame rate. Not to mention improved video capabilities, but I didn't buy this camera to shoot movies. These features aren't really that impressive. If my D90 hadn't died in a freak 6 year old accident (my son tried to take pictures of his goldfish up close and personal) I wouldn't have bought this camera. Don't get me wrong, it's a great camera and I'm sure I'll grow to love it in time, but if you already have a D90, I would hold on to it for now. Besides in about one year from now Nikon will probably be releasing an updated version(D7100??).",11-02-2011,11-02-2011

I moved to the D-300 and got the SB-900 flash and wow what a difference! The D-300 is an amazing camera. It is rugged and has given me countless great photos. The time lapse feature is so much fun! This camera also paid itself off in a short amount of time! A friend of mine let me borrow his Nikon D-3100 for a weekend. I thought is was a little small in my large hands but jammed with things I liked about it. Such as the 1080 p video and 14.2 mp. all for only $549.00.
After trying the D-3100 I looked into the larger D-7000 on YouTube. I was so impressed by the Video examples and reviews, that I purchased this camera the same day. The price is right, it's tough,fast 16.2 mp, 1080p video. Since I am already a Nikon owner, I have several lenses and an excellent Nikon lighting system, Battery grips,etc. so upgrading to this camera was exciting!

It's a class apart from the D5000. Many of the casual shots I took on the D5000 were somewhat manual, but the D7000 does everything so perfectly that you can shoot in Auto and not feel a difference. The Auto-WB settings (keep warm) is an absolute favorite of mine, since I no longer have to fine-tune my WB into a step warmer than the environment.
The pentamirror viewfinder is a lot brighter than the pentaprism mirror found on the D5000. And the rubber grip is solid. It feels right. I can confidently hold it vertically with just 1-finger below the rubber grip.
Low light pictures are a joy. I can shoot upto ISO-1600 confidently, whereas it was only ISO-400 in the D5000 world.
I have had no qualms shooting with the D7000 in rain, confident that the magnesium covering will keep the internals dry. And they did. I have had some bad spills over the camera (rain, sea water, some black tea), but nothing seems to have fazed it.

This is my first DSLR and it has been extremely easy to pick up. I mostly shoot landscapes and family gatherings. My first lens I purchased was the 18-200mm VRII lens. With that lens and this camera I was able to get outstanding images in just about any situation (I have since added the 35mm 1.8 for low light/indoor). The ability to shoot at a high ISO and still have a sharp looking image is fantastic. I love to take night time city skylines (on a tripod) with this camera. Ability to record video onto one SD card and Photos onto another makes processing/organizing simpler. That's how I choose to use the dual slots but you can configure it bests to your needs. Battery life has been great. 1080p HD video is fantastic. Only small minor complain is when you focus in a video that is already recording, the camera pics up the noise from the camera as it tries to focus. That's my only complain. I've tried a couple of HDR shots and they have looked pretty good, although I'm not a big HDR guy.

I use an 85mm 1.8 or the 50mm 1.8...much better pictures, lower noise, and with twice the frame rate, I have a better chance of catching the action shot.  I get clear sharp results from these two prime lenses.  My 18-200 lens seems a little less sharp on the D7000.  I have not yet done a side by side with my D80 to see if it is just my perception or it really is softer.
It is a much more 'professional' level camera with lots more settings and options to mess with.  It took me a while to figure out how to change some things.
I have only played with the video...a camcorder is much more convenient and easier to get great results with.  I thought I would use the video feature when events happened, but I find I want stills from my camera and use my iphone or camcorder to capture the action part.",10-14-2011,10-14-2011

Getting into DSLR was a joint decision between my father and I. He wanted a NIKON body so I chose the D7000, and boy am I glad I did. After reading many critical reviews I knew exactly why I wanted D7000. For those that are having a hard time deciding, (my other choices were the Canon 60d and Nikon D5100), here's JUST A FEW points as to why I made the decision to get the D7000.

First, let's start off with why you might choose a lower model Nikon, or a comparable other brand like the Canon 60D, T3i, etc:

- A cheaper model can save you a lot of $$$, leaving you more room to spend on glass and other accessories.
- The Canon's I mentioned and the D5100 from Nikon have the tilt/swivel LCD displays.
- Canon is better for video production, as it is more adjustable overall.
- Arguably, Nikkor lenses and accessories cost more. Like I said, arguably, as any quality piece of glass is $$$.

Now, why I decided to get the D7000:
- The feature set and AF system make the extra money worthwhile.
- I don't foresee myself actually needing the tilt screen to often. My buddies who shoot with tilt screens almost always have them in the regular position. Would I welcome it? Yes. Do I
  need it? No.
- Dual SD SLOTS! I thought I wouldn't care for this. It wasn't a part of my decision initially but when I got the camera I found that I love this feature. Two cards, with flexibility on
  how the camera uses them.
- U1, U2 custom user settings. Another thing I didn't particularly choose the camera for but once I used them they are golden.
- Nikon High ISO performance (including the D5100) is top notch. Enough said.
- The only video I will shoot is for cinematics. For this, the 24p 1080p is perfect, as real movies are shot in this format.

- Best of all, is the BUILD!!!!! By build I mean everything about the build. Quality, materials, and LAYOUT of buttons and functions. I wasn't used to the layout intially as I ""practiced"" with
Canon's a bunch before, but it is so easy and FLUID to use it really is awesome. Also, I absolutely love the DUAL DIALS (front and back) for adjustments. The clicky dials and single
dial layouts leave something to be desired especially on the lower end models. (This of course is personal preference) The ALLOY body feels so planted and durable. It's also more weatherproof than the other camera's I mentioned.

Basically, this is priced on the higher end of the Entry-Intermediate cameras, but for good reason. This is a ""PROSUMER"" product, and is for the serious enthusiast to semi-pro/pro.

As a side note, for me it was gonna be the T3i over the D5100 (no full manual exposure on D5100 video) and the D7000 over 60D. After going to a store first to feel the D7000 and 60D it was over.

The ONLY thing I was worried about was the back focusing issues people had. I worried for nothing, the focus on my kit lens and 50 1.8G are spot on. I shot a focus chart and the results were as expected. Maybe the firmware has something to do with it? (Mine shipped with 1.02)",10-13-2011,10-13-2011
https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D7000-DSLR-Body-Only/dp/B0042X9LC4?th=1,29,Electronics,Nikon D7000 DSLR (Body Only) (OLD MODEL),4.6,4,Amazing for the price point,"I have a variety of pro photography gear, which I use for my real estate work and for non-profit volunteer photography work.  I have been using a D2Xs--Nikon's last generation flagship body, which I paid more than $4,000 for a few years ago--as my primary body and a D70 as a backup/2nd body.  I purchased the D7000 figuring I would replace the D70 and continue shooting with the D2Xs as my primary body.  I was surprised to discover that the D7000 outperforms and outhandles the D2Xs in almost every way.

The focusing system is extremely fast and a marked improvement over the anything else I have used.  It is still not psychic, of course, but it does a good job in full auto, and with 38 focus points from which to choose, it offers good flexibility for pinpointing a specific focus point almost anywhere in your image.

Battery life is excellent for a non-professional body.  I shot 1,300 images with it one day last week.  I changed batteries preemptively.  The one with 1,300 images on it was still showing multiple bars remaining.

Low light performance just blows me away.  I try to avoid going higher than ISO800 on the D2Xs due to inescapable noise.  I had assumed that the only way to get a meaningful improvement in low light performance would be to get a full-frame body, such as the D700 or D3, but this body represents a major improvement.  I can shoot at ISO 1600 and ISO 3200 with very pleasing results.  Yes, ISO 3200 or 6400 will display noticeable loss of detail and smearing if you are looking at an images pixel for pixel. But the overall usability of those images is still very good.  This is the first body that I have used at automatic ISO, since I can then set shutter and aperture as my application demands, and I can know that the camera can then pick the ISO and still produce spectacular images.

The only meaningful drawbacks compared to a true professional body are 1) limited buffer for continuous shooting (but it still fires off several images in rapid-fire sequence), and 2) no built-in second shutter release for shooting vertically.  Yes, there are other differences, but most are not important for most folks.  For example, being able to get 1,500 images out of the D7000 battery versus maybe 2,500 out of the larger professional body batteries.  For the price point, this is quite remarkable.

I have not used this for video work yet, but it has excellent capabilities and an external microphone jack.  I have seen plenty of samples online of beautiful video work done with this body.  If you plan to use it for video, plan to use a tripod and/or to spend some serious money on accessories to help handle this body smoothly.  DSLRs are virtually impossible to hold out from your body (far enough to watch the LCD live view display) steady for any length of time.

Overall I am extremely pleased and amazed at the high end features for the price point.  I give it four stars and not five only because it is not literally perfect, but quite close!",10-09-2011,10-09-2011

I own a D5000 and love it as a travel camera but wanted the direct controls that I experienced on my brother's D90. So I took the chance and bought the d7000. I smiled after taking the first few pictures. I loved the feel, the speed, the metering, especially for flash photography, the ease of use, the focus points (and accuracy) and the controls. I've taken over 2000 pic so far with very few problems. I love the options for saving raw files. I used compressed 12-bit most of the time but sometimes uncompressed 14-bit for semi-pro work. There are so many things I love about the camera, but I just don't have the time to get into all of them. I did not find the image quality a huge step above the D5000, but there is definitely more detail and dynamic range at ISO100 for the pixel peepers and I love the old 12 MP sensor on the D5000 anyway. By the way, I still have my d5000.

What do I say!!!,"This camera is incredible, I am just learning it and it produces great pics...  I bought David Busch's (Engineering textbook) D7000 guide and after about 1200 shots am just beginning to scratch the surface of what this camera is capable of..  Many before me have written much better reviews with much better expanations on how great this camera really is so I won't go into that.
I am a hobbyist with a pretty good eye for photograpy that used a D50 for 5 years or so and SLR film user since the early 80's.  Early last year I had the opportunity to start shoot at a local charity's events (12-13 per year), HS graduations at their adult high school and program graduations as well.  I also really enjoy landscape, macro, wildlife and vacation photography as well. The D50 was OK and worked pretty well in regular light but started to have a lot of problems that several local repair facilities and Nikon all said buy a new camera...  My choices were the Nikon D90, D300s and the D7000 and after loosing on an Ebay bid for a new D300s I decided to go for the D7000 from Amazon.... Best price, fast delivery and good support incase something goes wrong...  I intend to buy an additional four year warranty extension to support my photography as soon as I recover from sticker shock and get a few new lenses...
I was a little intimidated by the vast ammount of functions that this camera offers but have found that if I am paitent and continue to learn one function at a time that I will have a great tool for a long time in the future... The fears I had about being too complicated to really learn, the strange over manipulated samples from Amazon's pics, FLICKR and several on line forums I belong to and the fear that I would only use about 35% of this camera's actual capabilities have been put to rest by David Busch's book...
I have shot mostly in one of the four modes controlled by the dial so far and have loved them. (Auto, Program, Shutter and Aperature)  Even on Auto most of the pics have turned out better than the D50.  As I gain a better knowledge of the functions and light readings of this camera I will begin to step away from the mode dial and start to use more of my choices for ISO shutter and ap speed...  Don't get me wrong, not every pic has come out calling to be framed and put on my wall at home but I can assure both the novice and the intermediate shooter that you will not regret buying this camera... It will grow with you (and until you become a pro if that is your goal) satisfy your every photographic need...  I am happy that I can use my old lenses during the learning curve so that when I am ready I will be able to shell out some buck for the real ""Glass"" that Nikon makes.  These old lenses still are great for a lot of pic taking and will suffice for a time...
The colors are great and actually really close to what the eye sees, I have been surprised time after time by the D7000 and how accurate and sharp the pics are even with Nikon kit lenses.  Since I really am not one of the so called artist style photographers but do believe that composition is very important in picture taking I have set the goal to do as little manipulation of the shots as possible.  With the old D50 it was pretty much manditory because the CCD was on its way out and when I had an event shoot often the camera (or the operator) was fooled by the types of lighting, a non TTL flash or a background that the camera didn't recognise a focal object and wouldn't get a clear focus on anything....  So far the only problem I have actually experienced withe the D7000 was getting it to pick a clear field of focus on a bunch of wild rice shoots with grain that was ready to be harvested...  Operator error not the camera...  I also understand that this is a universal problem with autofocus DSLR's...
My advice is if you are willing to put in the work and really learn photography,,,,, Buy it...",09-19-2011,09-19-2011

There is nothing NOT to like about this camera. I mean it does it all, and REAL well.

I've always been more of a Nikon guy myself, but about 2 weeks ago I went and bought the famous Canon 7D. It was a nice camera but there was just something about it (hard to explain) that didn't feel right to me and I just wasn't loving it all that much. Yes it is a nice-built, sturdy camera with 18MP and this and that, and it felt real nice in your hands but the images weren't looking how I wanted them to.

I returned it, I bought the Nikon D7000 and I was blown away. This camera, ""pound for pound"", accounting what you get for the price, is the bessttttt DSLR camera out today.

It is a 100 pounds in a 1 pound package! Yes, its that good and so easy to use.

Nikon has built one of the most amazing cameras ever at an cost effective price. It will out do Nikon's high end Pro products at twice or more the price.

At 16.2 million pixels you can read any Professional review out there and you too will be amazed at what the D7000 can do for you.

If you know nothing about camera's and want the best, the D7000 is the choice!  Nikon has just made it easy for the beginner,the hobbiest and even the Pro to use. You can switch on the ""live view switch"" (which closes the viewfinder eyepiece)and lets you use the large 3 inch monitor to see what you are shooting at, great for shooting over growds at parades,etc.

For the beginner Nikon has the ""Auto Setting Mode"" but has also incorperated their ""Scene Mode Setting"". This mode lets you set up and choose one of 19 scene modes. You can select Portrait,Landscape,Sunset or Child,etc and all the work is done for you. Just push the shutter release button and you will get pictures and professional results everytime.

If you are well informed and know how to use a single lens reflex digital camera, then you will be impressed with the U1 & U2 modes. You can customize your settings(great function)by simply turning the mode setting dial to U1/U2.

If your into movies, you will, at 16.2 million pixels get some of the best movies ever. The D7000 has dual SD cards and a HDMI mini pin connector output that attachs directly to your 1080 HD TV (cable not included).

The audio sensitivity level on my D7000 had to be turned to LOW, however, otherwise all audio-- onboard thru external mics-- was distorted badly. This is easily adjusted using the LCD menu. Also, the focus takes a bit to do its job, which is a pain if you're trying to use autofocus to quickly adjust between different objects at varying distances from the camera. This is the only real complaint I have about shooting video with the D7000. However, if focus remains constant throughout the scene, you're fine.

They are simply the BESt on line merchant on the internet. The D7000 is a mixed bag of good and bad. Its extremely quick and responsive. It is realitively easy to move from D90 or even D80 to this camera as most of the controls are similiar. The ISO performance is outstanding..at least two stops better then D90..acceptable up to 3200 with little post production. The metering is very good and the colors produced are very appealing. The cons..bad fit for large hands..or big glass. The images seemed softer then my D90. I tried everything to make this camera work for me..setting changes ..lens changes..etc..and just could not get any satisfaction for the image quality. ONe thing ..I never printed anything and someone mentioned a poor monitor..or one that does not show the quality of images ..so be sure to print up images..before you decide they are not sharp. Too bad I did not know this before returning. I would even be willing to try another unit it is that good a camera. I think the grip is very small and cramped for larger hands..which also turned me off. I actually ordered a grip but this did not help...infact made the whole unit feel unbalanced. I did not get the NIkon grip which may be heavier therefore better balanced.

The worst thing about the D7000 are its more ""beginner friendly"" ergonomics. The mode wheel on the D7000 is too easy to turn accidentally. Everything besides A, S, M, U1 and U2 are a waste for me. This could have been the perfect camera if they only made the buttons exactly like a D300s. The live view switch is too easy to hit accidentally with your thumb, especially if you use the AF lock button a lot (like, if you use it to enable autofocus). Its also too easy to accidentally press the DOF Preview button next to the lens mount as your left hand wraps around the lens. I can't imagine why they moved that button from its spot on the higher end Nikons.

The one true ergonomic advantage the D7000 has for me are its user modes. This is a HUGE advantage, as the more settings I have to change between shots, the more mistakes I make.  I set one of the user modes to manual with auto ISO and mixing ambient shots in with flash shots becomes a total breeze. The smaller size and weight of the D7000 had seemed like it would be a big advantage but it just doesn't feel that great in my hands. I might try the grip to help this. The weight difference between the two is small enough that I don't notice it much and prefer the D300s feel.

I had been worried that the buffer on the D7000 would run out too easily.  I have never gotten into trouble with this and I shoot in 14 bit RAW.  The stuff I shoot (typical Dad stuff, some portraits, some landscapes and long exposures), doesn't really require any burst shots, though.

The image quality seems to be about a stop and a half better than a D300s after processing RAW files via Lightroom 3.  I would pretty much never go above ISO 800 on the D300s.  On the D7000, I will gladly go to 1600 and will use 3200 about often as 800 on the D300s. This is a big deal to me because it seams I can go without a flash about 50% more often.

The autofocus and metering are a bit better on the D7000, but not enough for me to really care.

Manual focus on the D7000 is easier, as it gives you arrows in the viewfinder telling you which way to turn the focus ring.  D300s only gave you a dot for focus confirmation.  Manual focus in Live View seems a bit easier on the D7000. I am not sure why, but it feels slicker.  Maybe the screen is refreshing faster?  The LCDs have identical resolution, so this could be in my head also.

I love that the D7000 can use a cheap IR remote.  The ""remote mode"" on the D7000 is still a bit of a mess, in that it disables your normal shutter button, but its worth not having to deal with fancy wireless shutter releases and their ridiculous screw-in cables.

So in the end, I like the D7000 better.  Image quality and user modes really cinched it for me.",07-23-2011,07-23-2011

My one gripe relates to the ""Auto ISO"" function when used in conjunction with flash. The camera will generally jump up to your highest selected ISO when flash is engaged. I understand that in previous cameras such as the D90, the ISO would not exceed 400 if flash was engaged, even if the max ISO selected was in fact higher. This sounds like a better arrangment to me. The obvious work-around is to go in and lower the max ISO on your Auto ISO setting when using flash, which is difficult, just a matter of remembering to do this. Seems like something that could be corrrected with a software update, though. An extremely versatile camera. Highly recommended.
Update:

This camera has a setting under the Auto ISO function where you can set the minimum shutter speed that the camera will use, which is handy. However, some of the newer Nikons have the ability to automatically change this minimum based on the focal length of the lens at the moment. For instance, using a long lens you would likely need a faster minimum shutter speed than with a wide angle lens. The new cameras can automatically adjust the minimum to a higher value when they detect the longer focal length. The D7000 can't do that, which is not a deal breaker for me but would be nice feature to have.",07-20-2011,07-20-2011

If the D7000 focused precisely out of the box, as it's supposed to, I would have kept it, since I liked all of the other features it has. All of my photos from the D5100 were sharp using the same lenses, so the lenses weren't the problem. I tried AF fine tuning and it helped a little, but not enough, even after reaching the maximum adjustment factor. A camera at this price level should have better quality control. Sure there are manufacturing tolerances, but they should be able to get the most critical assemblies close enough so the camera at least focuses properly, rather than hoping that customers won't notice or requiring them to spend hours fine tuning the AF, sometimes to no avail. It seems like getting a good D7000 depends quite a bit on luck. I've yet to decide if I'll try another D7000 or if I'll just go back to a D5100.

The D7000 also overexposes in bright/high contrast situations when using matrix metering, causing highlights to be clipped and detail to be lost. Some say that this is just the advanced metering system working as intended. Perhaps, but it requires the user to use negative exposure compensation whenever a shot like this is taken (or to program it into one of the ""U"" settings). You don't always have time to do this when a a good photo op comes around. IMHO, this is a significant flaw that should be corrected via a firmware update.

BTW, some have stated that the D7000 has better IQ than the D5100. All reviews I've read state that they are exactly the same in IQ, or that the diff is so small that it's negligible. This is consistent with my experience. In certain situations, like sports and low-light fast motion shots, the D7000's better AF and metering might help produce better photos, but for everything else, they're pretty much the same.

UPDATE: I decided to give the D7000 another chance and ordered a second one. Same backfocusing problem. This time, adjusting the AF fine tuning by a factor of -4 for all of my lenses results in sharp focus, but using AF fine tuning isn't an ideal solution, since it causes the camera to not focus properly at infinity or at minimum focusing distance. Depending on the degree of AF tuning required, this could then require the user to manually adjust the focus ring after the AF has ""reached its limit"" (the limit which has changed due to the use of AF fine tuning). Another unnecessary hassle you need to remember to take care of. The AF fine tuning feature is nice to have, but its purpose is to dial-in lenses that are a bit off due to manufacturing tolerance. I don't think it was intended to adjust a faulty body to work with lenses that are in spec, but that's the way it's often being used.

For anyone who buys a D7000, I'd recommend doing a focus test as soon as you get it, to ensure that you're getting the IQ you paid for. The best way to do this is with a focus test chart, but a quick and dirty method is to tape a page of text on the wall (make sure it's totally flat against the wall). Then, mount your camera on a tripod perpindicular to the wall, with lens (set at the largest aperture) at the same height as the page. Take a shot or two using autofocus through the viewfinder. Use the remote or self timer, with mirror lockup. Then take some shots using live view. If the AF photos are not as sharp as the LV shots (or at least very close to them in sharpness), your AF is off (most likely back focusing).",07-11-2011,07-11-2011

After having owned a D70, D5000, D90, the D7000 is a very different kind of beast. The initial body that I received had massive problems to focus with any of my 6 Nikon lenses, even the new 50mm 1.8G. After initially attributing the poor focus of all my pictures taken to my lack of experience with the camera, I eventually learned from series of test shots that the camera had a massive back focus problem. After exchanging the body for a new one at least one of my 6 lenses (35mm 1.8G) would correctly focus, all others had to be manually calibrated with AF fine tuning. While this process works in principal, I reject to notion that after spending $1.200 on a camera I would have to do so by default. It further tells me that the D7000 no longer is a camera in the league of a D90, which also allowed an hobbyist/enthusiast - consumer to take decent photographs. Thus said, the D7000 largely receives good reviews from professional photographers who know how to calibrate their lenses or people who deny that a $1,200 Nikon could be a bad product.

I urge everyone owning a D90 to hold on to it, as I wished I never had sold mine.

P.S. Yes, I spend lot's of time with the Nikon support desk, but they never bothered to answer my emails after I uploaded my test shot.

Now I am sitting on a bag of Nikon glassware and a camera that I have no confidence in.

This is very close to the D700 in low light and although I shoot in RAW for editing later it is great to be able to simultaneously shoot JPEGs, processed for a little saturation and sharpening in-camera and fire them off in email or post to the Web with zero other processing. This camera is head and shoulders above the D80 and D90; especially for low-light. I can shoot ISO 6400 and have very useable images. With some noise reduction in camera or post-processing they are really great and it allows that much more flexibility in low-light.

Another thing I love about this camera is it gets the exposure right nearly every time! It's impressive. I often flipped from aperture priority to manual on the D80 to get it right. I can't believe the camera is so much lighter than the D700 either. I really love this thing. My most frequent setting which works for what I do much of the time is to aperture priority with the Auto-ISO set to ISO 100, shutter speed 1/125 and Max ISO 6400.

I like that there is a custom menu, My Menu, for easy access to options I use all the time. I like that I can assign the Fn button to Picture Control and switch between Vivid and Portrait in under a second.

With such a capable camera and with the HDR craze these days I am a little surprised it only does 3 shots for bracketing but 3-5 shots is all you really need. If you want 5 you have to do those other 2 manually. That is why I gave it 4 stars in performance. Otherwise I just love this thing.

The HD video works well but you will hear that autofocus going unless you have an external mic or turn off autofocus/use a manual focus lens. I bought this for stills but the video is still handy once you remember you have that capability.

There are probably 5 more things I love about this camera but can't recall without it in my hands. Anyhow, if you are on the fence. Jump off and get it. It's true the camera does not make the photographer but this one sure helps. Since upgrading from the D80 people tell me how much they like my photos and I think some of it is attributable to the warmness of portraits shot in the low-light this thing can do. Unconsciously people are probably identifying how these quality photos differ from their pop-up flash facial blow out shots.",06-28-2011,06-28-2011

I always felt that the autofocus wasn't quite as good as my old cheapie N80 film camera, or the D70.  And, I never felt that either the D70's or the D200's sensor was as senstive as good old fashioned fim.  However, the D7000 exceeded all of my expectations!  I always shoot in fine jpeg's, and I must say that the image quality and autofocus are stunning!  Plus, the 100% viewfinder really makes a difference. ISO 6400 is very good.  This camera feels very refined, and the shutter is far quieter than the D200.  One thing that threw me off at first is the shutter release - it's very sensitive.

The Nikkor D7000 with the 18-200mm lens has the look and feel of a real SLR film camera, but with some unique features and quirks.  Perhaps most importantly is the fact that this camera does not use film cartridges.  Instead, you use computer disks that hold hundreds of photos and have a range of built-in ISOs.  Notably, there is no loud winding noise when removing a full disk...it's virtually silent--a welcomed change for wedding/event photographers.

Secondly, there is a large screen on the camera's back for viewing the pictures that you just took.  The screen also lets you access an internal computer where you use various lists for customization and effects.  For example, you can change from color to black and white with a few button maneuvers.  After a few weeks, I still haven't used all the computer options.

When you're done shooting (wedding, sports, etc.), set your computer to ""Import"" and you can review on the PC's monitor.  Then simply select ""Print All"" to print all the photos.  Ink and paper costs can be as much or more expensive than processing, but it is so convenient once you get the hang of it.

No, I'm not selling my Nikon F6, but I'll definitely  be getting my money's worth with my new ""digital bad boy"".

Read so many reviews and people begging the question, ""D7000 or D300s?"" I can tell you now, D7000. This camera is an all new camera and I love it. I won't get into technical specs/functionality since those can all be read on the Amazon/Nikon web site. Ergonomics would be my biggest complaint. I like a large camera because I want it to fill my hands and the D7000 is big(ish) but not D300s big. I find no issues with the autofocus; spot-on every time. The ISO performance is outstanding! It's certainly the best in all DX format Nikons right now and shooting with an f/1.4 lens, you can basically take shots in the dark. It has a lot of great in-camera editing that you can take advantage of while out snapping some shots. The HD video with a fast card looks incredible! The AF on the video tries very hard to be good but it tends to ""hunt"" a lot and non AF-S lenses are heard on playback and it's loud (gears turning the focus), best bet is manual focus. The screen resolution looks fantastic but so do all new DSLR cameras these days. I have owned 6 Nikon DSLR cameras over the past 4 years and am NOWHERE near experienced like many but I do believe anyone thinking of upgrading from a D90/D300/D300s should. The main reason would be ISO performance; it really makes this camera great if you cannot afford lots of expensive lenses (f/2.8 or better). I love mine and making the change was something I would never regret.",06-25-2011,06-25-2011

Now the Nikon D7000 is here I am very unhappy with this camera. The still pictures are excellent. But Nikon should have stayed out 0f the movie business until they perfected auto focus in movie mode. I took a trip to Alaska and took 200 plus still pictures that were excellent. But the movies are mostly out of focus that were made in auto focus mode. It is not because I don't know what I was doing it was because of the poor auto focus. When I used manual focus it worked fine. The Nikon D7000 camera does not compare to the Panasonic Lumix GH1 Or The GH2 for movies and the still  pictures are just as good as the pictures from the Nikon D7000. My advise is save your self $200 dollars and buy a Panasonic GH2. I would return this camera for a refund,but seller does not have a return policy.

The D7000 is amazing ergonomically with the right buttons where you need them.  Works great with all my old lens including the pre-AI ones and the Nikon PB-5 Bellows.  The only thing I miss from the D5000 is the articulating screen, that really helps with very low and vertical shots.  And I love flash commander mode with 2 SB-900s.

Got the MB-D11 grip with it.  Kinda pricey but makes the camera sooooo much easier to hold with larger lens plus you get a spot for a second battery.  Makes portrait orientation a snap with extra buttons where they should be in your hands.

I'm a still photographer but I did check out the video.  Image quality is great but autofocus hunts a little.  Manually focusing smooths it out as will a tripod.  Needs external mics and there is a jack for that. Definitely usable for video clips as part of a presentation.

I bought the Nikon D7000 as a backup to my D300. Now the D7000 is my main camera and the D300 is the backup. Great camera.

Update 06-20-2011: I just downloaded over 300 photos I took at a dog event. There was dog races and frisbee catching, etc. It was an all day event so I took both my D300 and my D7000. The focus on the D7000 was amazing, the rate of in focus shots much higher than I expected, very, very few frames were out of focus (most of the out of focus shots was user error). During the dog race, the animals were running at top speed toward me, the D7000 and Sigma 70-200mm f2.8 OS lens kept up correct focus while firing at 6 fps. The thing that impressed me most was the exposures. Every one was right on, bright back lit to subjects in the shadows, it didn't matter, the D700 exposed the picture correctly. On the other hand, my D300 was not as accurate. I was constantly adjusting the D300's EV up and down to get the right shot. As for the D300 in focus rite, it missed more shots than the D7000. I put the D300 back in my camera bag and used the D7000 for the remainder of the day. I can't say enough about the focus system on the D7000. It's more accurate, and faster than any camera I've owned.
I think I'm going to sell the D300 and save for the D400 when it's released, for I have a great camera to use until that time arrives.

Like many others I had a hard time learning how to use this model effectively even to the point of maybe sending it back. Well, it took about 300 test frames till I became satisfied with the IQ and overall performance of the D7k. Where an ISO of about 320 was the max I liked with the D90 I now shoot a default ISO of 1000 on this body. I found out I need to shoot at higher shutter speeds and that the D7k is not as forgiving as the D90. The ability to fine tune each lens to this body is a big plus. I still have a lot to learn but as it stands right now I'm happy with my switch and plan on keeping it. I'm not sure if this is a good choice for a novice as that would depend on many things.

I learned that camera pretty well and absolutely loved shooting with it. But I am an amateur and always felt a little guilty having spent that much money on a hobby. What's more, the D700 is big and heavy compared to amateur cameras (it's an awesome size for pros), and I actually found myself leaving it at home on occasion because of that size and weight. So when the D7000 was out for a bit and received such good reviews, I jumped.

I fell in love with the D7000 immediately and sold the D700. Of course, I would have kept both if I could justify the cash, but the D7000 is so good that I usually don't feel like I'm missing much. There are quite a few interesting points to be made comparing the two cameras, but I recognize that the average shopper would not be considering the two in the same class, so I'll just say I'd be happy to answer questions in the comments. The short version is that while the D700 produces slightly better images and generally handles better, the D7000 is at least 90% the camera for the half the price and is better suited to the amateur shooter in several respects.

So why do I like it so much?

-Beautiful images, of course.
-Low light performance is extremely admirable for a DX sensor.
-100% viewfinder
-Flash commander mode for using flash off-camera
-The right amount of heft and size for my taste. Build feels excellent, and it's got weatherproofing!
-Dual SD cards are a nice touch.
-Handling is great. U1 and U2 modes are a wonderful addition. Nikon's command dials have a nice feel and are extremely useful.
-I didn't buy this camera for video, but the video looks great IF you handle it right. Think movie camera rather than family video cam.

What I don't like as much?

-Buffer is a bit small when shooting NEF (RAW). It doesn't affect me because I don't shoot much action, but heavy sport shooting could be difficult in NEF.
-SD cards still aren't as fast as CF cards.
-Viewfinder is a nice size for DX, but it's still nowhere near the size of an FX viewfinder.
-I think I prefer the AF selector on the D700 by a hair. One finger vs two. Not that big a deal.
-See above, but video is obviously not as easy as a dedicated video camera. Who cares?

I mentioned the D5100 in my title because I think many people are wondering if the D7000 is worth the extra cost over the D5100. The short answer is that it depends on how serious of a shooter you are. Do you understand the relationship between shutter speed, aperture, and ISO? If the answer is ""No, and I don't care,"" stop reading and buy the D5100, or even the D3100. Do you want to film your kids playing soccer? The D5100 is better suited for that, although I'd really suggest you buy a dedicated video camera. These are primarily still cameras after all. If you're a more advanced shooter, or you'd like to become one, consider the following:

Some people say the D5100 has the same sensor and the option to shoot video at 30 fps, so why would you possibly want a D7000 instead? There are several very important upgrades that the D5100 does NOT have, some of which I could not live without:

-Flash commander mode: Enables you to shoot your external flash or flashes off camera. Huge capability.
-Continuous shooting speed is 6 fps vs 4 fps.
-Battery life is far superior
-Dual SD cards. Not critical, but a very nice feature for backup especially.
-Lossless compressed 14-bit NEFs. Probably not a deal breaker, but I want every bit of quality available from that sensor!
-100% viewfinder vs 95%. I didn't know I wanted it until I got it.
-Non AF-S lens compatible (for autofocusing), Will meter with AI lenses. Another huge feature. I can use my 30-year-old 85mm f/2 lens.
-Faster shutter
-Better AF system. Another big deal for dynamic shooting situations.
-Flash bracketing

The D5100 is cheaper, lighter, has a swiveling screen, and shoots video at 30 fps.

At $300 more, I think the D7000 is an excellent value compared to the D5100 when you consider the extra features it has.

What else can I say that hasn't already been said elsewhere? The D7000 is the camera to beat in this class, if you know how to shoot, and often, even if you don't.",06-10-2011,06-10-2011

(UPDATE after Nikon service),"If you currently shoot an SLR that makes you nervous about the noise every time you take it beyond 800 ISO, this is the body for you. For flash-less wedding ceremonies and low light event shoots, this body DOMINATES the power of ISO by making shots that were previously impossible, possible. I actually caught myself shooting in the DARK with the camera before I realized how impossible it was to do what I wanted. It's ISO capabilities will make you delusional.

Everything else it does well too but not well enough to warrant a paragraph like above. You still need to have decent lenses (I mate my D7K to the old standards, 50mm f/1.8, 24-70 f/2.8, and 70-200 f/2.8 vr along with a Tokina 11-16 f/2.8) but this body will only help unlock even more of your lens capabilities.

***** UPDATE *****
Alrighty. So after months of using the D7000 I randomly started having what looked like backfocus issues. At first I thought it was my Tokina since my Nikkor lenses seemed to work but within two weeks, all three lenses couldn't be broken... So with horrendous back-focusing issues, I sent the body into Nikon to have it looked at (under warranty).

Nikon received my body, fixed it, and mailed it back in a week. PPPPEEEERRRRFFFFFEEEECCCCTTTT once again. It's gone back to focusing correctly and all it well. Some small pieces were replaced and all of the AF related things were adjusted (according to the invoice).

Can't think of a better fit with the D300s being too heavy and too large for my taste. 2- Feels snappier and a bit more responsive. 3-Auto focus quicker and more accurate. 3-The menus are set up pretty much the same with the D7000 having more choices to make in the menus. I am sure I am leaving out all kinds of things but that is just a quick run down of a few things I noticed today as I was shooting. Just a really confident inspiring camera.

I love it my D7000! Nothing beats this camera for the price. I gave it 4 stars because unfortunately there is no ""perfect"" camera. The fact is that newer technology most of the time brings more bugs with it. 16MP is already high enough, personally i don't need anything higher than that, i don't even have it set to 16MP, i usually put it in 9MP or lower. I don't print LARGE prints, and i certainly don't get paid for it.

Anyway, the reason why i have posted this info is to let everyone that owns a D7000 to try something that i read in an online forum. I just followed what they said, reset EACH menu settings WITHIN the menus in the camera and do a couple other simple things. I just did it myself right before i typed this info for you and i will test my camera within the next couple of days, starting today, and i will post the results of this simple procedure. By the way, this information was given by a Nikon Technician. Here is the short and simple procedure, Good luck everyone i hope it works and please post your comments to see the overall results. Here you go:

Reset all and EACH of the menu system to default settings. Then turned off the camera. While off,  press the two green buttons at the same time Holding them down, use another finger to turn the camera on. The camera will then blink after two seconds, then shut it back off while holding down the buttons(basically you never let go of the two green buttons).

UPDATE AS OF 6/8/2012:

After performing the above reset, I have ALSO calibrated all my lenses with AF Fine Tuning and it looks like it really worked!! I am very happy, i have been testing the camera for about two days so far, and focusing the same way i was before when getting the back focusing, and so far it looks VERY VERY GOOD. The camera seems to be focusing exactly where it should be compared to before, i am seeing a BIG diffence specially in low light. This is very good news!  Bottom line:  Even if you do all the above you still HAVE to know which AF setting AND metering mode you have to use depending on what scenario you are in.  The camera DOES NOT do this automatically for you.",05-19-2011,05-19-2011

It is a GREAT combo. I love my camera. The downfall is that the first units had a problem with bright spots on the LCD and in movies (stuck pixels). A firmware update fixed this. It has the same processor as the D5100 but the d5100 shoots movies in 30fps where this one 24fps. The won't update the firmware for this. Seems like a scam to me. Overall I don't know if I would stick with Nikon on my next camera, I may go Canon. I'm happy with it, just wish the company was focused on their customers demands like Apple is. I don't feel like I have a voice and am just a sale for them. Do a good comparison before you buy this and make sure it does everything you want.

I used it with Sigma 17-70mm F2.8-4 and Sigma 50-150mm F2.8 lenses on my flight tour over Chicago downtown.

As an owner of Nikon D200 I can say that this body is lighter and smaller, which is good and bad.
Good part - your bulk load would be not so heavy as with D200. Bad part - if you get used to holding D200 or similar body (D300) then D7000 would feel not so comfy (big) in your hands. Plus, if you have big hands (long fingers) it might not be a very comfortable. But it is something that you can get used to with time.

Another, thing that would require getting used to is controls, focusing - D7000 has more focusing points but also it has a bit different setting than D200. If set it up as you like it at first then it should not be an issue, but if you would rely on basic auto focusing (default all 39 points) it might be frustrating because it might focus on something that you do not expect.
Well, again - just matter of time to get know this camera and set it up for your self.

In regards of quality / sharpness of the image - I got scattered result due to condition of shooting - I was in flying plane with some little turbulence. But when I was standing on air field most of my images were sharp. Just a side note - I shoot RAW (NEF) which would require post editing, including some sharpening.
In addition to this part - it all depend on what glass you are using. This factor would contribute to sharpness and brightness of the images - greatly. And you have to remember that each lens has it own ""sweet spot"" - aperture that would produce sharp images - it is not always F16 or F22.

Along with purchasing this camera I purchased 2 32Gb SD class 10 card (Transcend). Unfortunately for me - one card in Slot #1 failed when I was in the air. I tried to resurrect it but ended up removing it and moving card in slot # 2 into #1 slot. But it is not cameras fault. After this everything worked well.

Another point that you would need to get used to is buffer size of this camera, especially if you are shooting RAW and with continuous shooting. As to my test in High Speed Continuous shooting camera can  store up to 10 RAW images and then it shuts off to unload buffer which takes about 9-10 seconds and this is with class 10 cards.
As oppose to D200 which can handle 21 sequential RAW images it might look not enough. But - it is for you to decide if you can live with such buffer.

Menus - are similar to D200, so if you a proud owner of this camera then it should not be a problem for you to work with menus.

I'm sure there are many other little things that can be found (good and bad) - but it would be just a matter of your own taste.

Wish you good luck and have fun with this camera if you are buying it.",05-09-2011,05-09-2011

I don't care if the sensor is 3/4 instead of full frame. The images are perfect. 16 MP and RAW format won't let anybody to tell that the pics were not taken by a profesional 5.000$ camera.
I recommend to buy the body only plus the Nikon 18-200 lens. Probably that's all you'll need.
The only con is the User's manual: This camera has so many features and functions that you must be prepared to read a lot in order to understand and use everything.

I've been shooting with it for almost 3 months and I love it! This is certainly a lot of camera for a beginner, and even can be overwhelming for someone that knows a bit or more about photography. The performance at high iso is very good considering, and is an improvement over the D90. The presence of AF tuning is a welcomed surprise. This camera is packed full of features at a great price. It is absolutely the best bang for the buck if your budget allows. That said, there are other worthy contenders and one doesn't have to purchase a camera of this cost or model level to make good photos. Remember, it's more about the glass you put on the camera and the person pushing the shutter. The body is just your tool to make it easier to take the photos you want.

I have no complaints with my D7000 and consider it is an excellent upgrade if you are coming from an entry-level or older dSLR. If coming from an entry level model, you will gain nice features like 100% viewfinder, built-in focus motor, commander mode for off-camera flash control, a larger and better LCD, and access to more controls and settings at your finger tips rather than having to dig through menus or push combinations of buttons. If choosing between this or a D90, you really can't go wrong with either. If your budget allows, go for the D7000, but otherwise, go for the D90, use the difference to buy a nice lens, and enjoy taking photos.

If just starting out, please just remember that it's not just the camera that is critical for taking photos. In fact, technique and lens are both in line for most important pieces of the puzzle in front of the camera. Take the time to learn and understand and don't necessarily blow your entire budget on a camera thinking it is the most important part. Save the difference and upgrade your lens or add a fast prime or flash to your bag. Also, this camera isn't an entry level camera and while it will be fine for beginners, it can also be overwhelming if you don't take the time to read the manual and learn the concepts.",05-02-2011,05-02-2011

I won't try to duplicate the level of detail that you can read in some of the excellent reviews that have already been posted (here, and on many other sites), but will try to summarize some of my experiences with the camera, as well as provide some of the most important information regarding the camera. I've been primarily shooting with the Nikon 18-200mm VR lens, but have also used the Nikon f/1.8 50mm prime, as well. So, my review here will be focused on those lenses, but it is useful to have this background as you read my comments.

Getting straight to the nitty-gritty, and leaving extended explanations and comments until afterwards, and based on my actual use of this camera:

Pros
+ Ability to shoot at extremely high ISO levels with little noise (comparatively speaking) makes this a low-light shooter's dream
+ Sophisticated 39-point focus system
+ Good overall image quality in a wide range of shooting situations
+ Good video quality that makes up for many of the deficiencies of previous Nikon models
+ Huge feature set, with large number of customizable settings surpassed only by very expensive, professional cameras
+ Excellent construction quality, with few, if any, squeaks and/or loose assembly parts
+ Large set of ""mechanical"" controls, including switches, knobs, and assignable buttons which allow you to shoot without being required to dig through menus
+ Optical viewfinder amongst the best you will see in the camera's price range
+ LCD display at top of camera displaying current settings
+ Built-in autofocusing mechanism allows for the widest range of compatibility with past and current Nikon lenses
+ Extremely good battery life - I'm getting 400-500 shots on a single battery (no flash)
+ Quick turn-on time; it's ready almost as soon as you flip the switch
+ Excellent rear display that provides good resolution imaging and also provides an excellent setting display (each when activated)
+ Dual-card SDXC memory slots which can be set for either simultaneous (i.e., duplicate) or consecutive (i.e., switches to card 2 when card 1 is full) writing
+ Reasonable pricing, when you consider what you get

Cons
- A bit heavy; this thing can wear you out after a few hours
- Although many report a comfortable grip, the size of the camera could have been smaller (this is personal taste, however)
- No articulated display screen (the lack of which really limits video taking, but for those of us who have for years used an articulated display for photography, it's a real shortcoming, and one that is not easy to work around - again, as it pertains to PHOTOGRAPHY, this is a very personal taste issue; for VIDEO, which this camera shoots quite well, it's a real shortcoming)
- LiveView is still too slow to be really feasible (and can in no way match Sony's SLT cameras and some of their traditional SLRs, some of which focus instantaneously in LiveView; if you are looking for LiveView, I suggest you look elsewhere)
- Power on/off flip switch feels somewhat mushy, with no clear click position for On"" (and its wild just how much this can bother me over time)
- Battery charger design is too large, and does not have foldable prongs for the wall outlet (who at Nikon can overlook such simple, but important things as this?)
- No built-in GPS (can't believe its not included at this price; it's an optional component)
- Pricing is unlikely to come down in the near future

There is no reason to try and deny it: the Nikon D7000 is, in many respects, an amazing camera. As I mentioned above, one of the areas in which I have been most impressed is the camera's ability to have it set way up to 2,400 ISO and even higher and then just be used to knock off good quality photos in very low light settings at noise levels that were typically associated with cameras shooting at 400 ISO. In a pinch, you can move the ISO way up to 6,400, and although at this point noise is a real factor, you can still get some shots that would have been impossible before. But even at modestly high ISO levels in the 2000's and 3000's level, you can take shots with little noise, and this is, where in my mind, the camera really stands out from many others (the camera uses the same Sony sensor used in Sony's SLT a55 camera, which may largely account for this capability).

The camera feels tightly built and well constructed. Whether or not it is 100% magnesium construction underneath (you can read this debate in many online postings), the camera feels much more like a professional camera that a lower cost entry level model. The grip and design of the camera make holding the unit comfortable, although it is a bit on the large side (some people like the large size to help them hold the camera better). In addition, the camera is physically heavier than I would prefer, and I find myself dreading picking it up at times because I know its weight. This is, of course, multiplied when you add a lens like the Nikon VR 18-200mm that I am using, because, by that point, you have a pretty heavy set. But, as I say, this is a personal preference, and many people considering a purchase like this understand ahead of time (and accept) that this type of camera will be somewhat large and somewhat heavy.

Image quality is very good. The camera is capable of producing extremely high quality images, given the right lens selection and the right technique. I say that sentence carefully, because it is really a mistake to think that you can purchase a D7000 kit and, based on the rave reviews, just knock off one great picture after the other. Many, many reviewers (both professional and lay) have confirmed that that kit lens sold with the D7000 is not up to a camera of this quality, and simply exposes the shortcomings of the lens in shots. This means that in order to take advantage of the D7000's capabilities, you really need to put a good lens on it. My choice of the Nikon VR II 18-200mm may not be that lens for that absolute best quality, due to compromises such a zoom lens makes to get such wide range coverage. However, putting a prime on the camera can allow the camera's characteristics really shine, and even using the 18-200mm is a huge step up from the kit (and offers you wide versatility). But, in addition, the proper technique must also be used to achieve optimal results.  One should use a working knowledge of photographic technique to get good images. Use a tripod - even a mini one - when you can. Always use the lens hood, especially when shooting outside. Use fast shutter speeds to keep images sharp. Increase aperture when shooting indoors to maintain sharpness. The camera tends to overexpose in bright light shooting, so reduce the exposure to -1/3 or even -2/3 for outdoor shooting. And on and on. The D7000 can put out great shots, but you can't overlook technique and expect it to rescue every shot without effort. You also need to experiment with normal/vivid settings, because these greatly affect the overall color and saturation of the images according to taste.

One thing I feel needs to be mentioned is the image softness of the D7000. Many other reviewers have mentioned this (both arguing that such softness does, and then, does not, exist) but my own experience does indeed find that the D7000 images tend to be on the soft side. But that does not mean the photos are bad, or that this an unalterable outcome. There is in-camera sharpening that can be applied. Better still, one can shoot in RAW mode, and then use software tools to post process the images (using RAW mode can also address the overexposures that sometimes occur in bright light situations).  Even if shooting in standard jpg format, you can use image editing software and bring up thee sharpness quite well. But, in my own experience, the D7000 does tend to be a bit soft, and knowing this ahead of time can allow you to take steps to address this before you even shoot your first photo. Of course, if you have the budget for it, putting high quality prime lenses up front will really move image sharpness upward, but this is often a costly route for the lay photographer.

In sum, I have found the Nikon D7000 to be an impressive camera that represents a next step in the evolution of SLR technology. It would have been nicer if it had been a bit smaller and lighter, and infinitely more enjoyable if an articulated screen had been employed, but these things are often in the realm of personal taste, and thus, are not fixed determinates of how one will like the camera. The D7000 can knock out great photos in low light conditions that you have previously given up on, and its slew of features and customizability will keep you busy for months learning it all. It's a shame the price won't be coming down in the near future, but it does not seem likely at this time. Five stars.

One of the main reasons I got this one was because of the video feature(I am an amateur filmmaker) and it does not disappoint! Far better than any of the prosumer video cameras in this price range I have used quality is fantastic.

As far as pictures, I am still putting the camera through it's paces, but so far it has not disappointed in that area either, the clarity and color are wonderful so far. The autofocus is quick in most lighting conditions(worthless when shooting video though). The shutter is quiet as well. Now, addressing the title of the review: I added the if you can use it because a lot of the more negative reviews tend to reference downfalls that only occur when using one of the auto or program modes. If you are an aspiring pro, or even hobbyist really, you should rarely, if ever, use a scene or program mode. There's a reason this camera has almost twice as many buttons/knobs/what-have-you than the D5000: you are meant to use them!

In conclusion, this is a great camera for those looking to step up from an entry level DSLR or for one who is looking to come from film but you're not willing to drop $2k on a more expensive camera. If you're wanted to compare it to a D300s or D700, you should stop, because as far as photos, it will not compare at all.

Ken Rockwell's review was spot on. This camera makes taking beautiful pictures even easier. I have been happy with its ergonomics, weight, and quality.  (I also got the md-b11 battery grip and love its overall feel.) I opted for the body only to go with other lenses that I already own. I have been especially happy with the low light performance of the camera. This was definitely a great step forward in camera evolution for Nikon.  If you are shopping in this price range and do not have money invested in other brands of lenses than I highly recommend it. It is hard to say you should switch from another platform considering there are so many solid offerings. Canon's 7D, wow. But for the Nikon crew this is a great camera. Highly recommend. Be sure to do your homework though. I have read so many horror stories of people having bad experiences because they did not know what they were buying. Spending over $1,000 does not make you a photographer, or guarantee that your photos will be dazzling.

And please, since this is just my personal opinion that I just want to share with others, those who already own D7000 shouldn't feel offended by my review because this is just my personal experience I had with D7000.

I first bought D90 but soon switched to d7000 because I only hear good things about it..  Like many of you, I spent days after days searching for just a right camera which can take my photography skill to the next level.

Anyway, to make the long story short at first I liked the camera because it takes sharp photos with nice color rendering.  I was using nikkor 35mm f 1: 1.8G lens and although it's not the best lens out there it handled the low light condition pretty well.  Most of the shots I took came out pretty sharp and bright with almost no noise even at 3200 ISO.  However, the more I take the photos I soon began to notice there's something lacking in the pictures.  They're well focused, bright, clean and vivid so what's the problem here?  The problem is that my photos do not look `natural'.  It almost feel as if I am looking at, sort of like photo realistic, well drawn painting or perhaps I should say, `computer animation graphic like you see in Pixar movies. (ex. Toy Story)  Of course, with Photoshop tweak that problem becomes even more apparent.  If you're not sure what I mean, please go to flickr.com and type D7000 and see if you can tell the difference.

But D90, on the other hand, although it wasn't as 'perfect' as I thought(good though, just not perfect) at least it gaves me realistic looking photos.  I saw many review clips on Youtube that compare D7000 to D300s and explain the reasons why they think D7000 is a better choice over D300s.  Well, I am begining to question if those people at youtube are truthfully being objective in sharing their honest opinion, or if they were smply hired by Nikon to promote and boost sales of new D7000.  From looking at the sample photos from different sites it really wasn't hard to tell D7000 and D300s are not in the same level as far as the picture quality goes.  Even with heavy photoshop tweaks I still think those photos from D300s still do look like ""photos"".:

Of course, the quality of lens has A LOT to do with it too.  I just wish there's more acutal photo comparsion done with same lens with different bodies, or vise vesa and let the viewers come to better understanding with image quality generated by each camera/lens.  Some people like vivid colors, some don't--It's very subjective matter.  Just comparing the spec between cameras don't really mean much to me, as quality of photo is more important than anything else.  For others, other functions like capability of full HD, High ISO, and etc are just as important as image quality.  I know some guys in Youtube said image quality of D7000, when comapred to that of D300, looked ""at least"" the same or in some cases, better.  In my honest opnion,  that is not true. D300s is better when it comes to image quality.  When I look at the details from D7000 and D300s, it's sharpness is kind of like comparing it to  ""Pencil vs. 0.3 mechanical pencil.
Don't get me wrong, Nikon D7000 in my opinion, is a good camera.  Many people also choose D7000 because of full HD capability.  I was certainly one of them.  But after all, I am buying a camera, not a camcorder.  I mean, taking a great looking shots certainly weighs more than multi-function camera.  Again, D7000 is a good camera.  D90 is good too consider it's value.  But I don't think it is equivalent with D300s as some claim.  I came to a conclusion:  You get what you paid for.",04-15-2011,04-15-2011

Currently use an Olympus E-30, with High Quality lenses and the D7000 with pro level lenses. The D7000 is a very complex camera and the first camera I have purchased a guide book for.

Ergonomics/design of the camera are quite good for its size. About the same size as the D70s/90. I would prefer a larger body when using pro level lenses. An expensive camera for a novice with a large learning curve for all of the available options of which there is a plethora of. But camera can be set similar to a P&S if one desires.

I really enjoy the many direct access shortcuts (over 40) for adjusting everything from focus to flash to white balance and much more. The two custom settings are very easy to set. The LCD on top has some icons (e.g. flash settings) that are really hard to see what they are if you need reading glasses. I miss the Olympus Super Control panel.

Some strange things show on top level menus and in the Information Display considering most commonly changed settings. However there are other options to establish a menu that allows one to set up their most common items. But it is another learning curve.

The camera seems to shoot about a 1/3 to 2/3 over what I like for exposure. Colors are different from even the D70s but very acceptable. Again both are adjustable. Outstanding at hi ISO. Can shoot very useable photos at 3200 ISO when the user understands what needs to be done.

If I had a D90 I'm not so sure I would upgrade. Besides the FX and D300s, and if you want the options/controls - this is the camera to have.
BTW - it does not have a mag-alloy body as commonly stated and Nikon's estimated price for the body is $1199.00.",04-14-2011,04-14-2011

I sold the D3100 as it's a great beginner DSLR but I outgrew it very quickly for the type of control/flexibility I needed.

First, I read some reviews the pictures are not sharp. This DSLR body works best with PRO GLASS PERIOD. If you use the $300 kit lens 18-105mm and wonder why your shots are soft it's probably a combination of your ability and your lens.

I was debating on getting the D700 or the D7000. I am glad I got the D7000, the D700 is a better camera but its not worth DOUBLE the price for FX and 1 stop of improvement. This camera is the most advanced DSLR APS-C PERIOD. Canon touts more megapixels but Nikon rules in high ISO capabilities. I have taken shots with this camera at 10,000 ISO and they are not perfect (compared to a FX D700) but they are very usable. Where I feared using ISO 3200 on my D3100/D90/D5000 I don't even blink an eye when I need to go ISO 6400. I try not to shoot at extremely high ISOs but depending on the lens I am using sometimes you have to and knowing you can opens up a whole new advantage over other DSLRs.

Comparing this to the D90 it is not a horizontal upgrade. This camera is better than the current D300s - the only thing it lacks is the slower fps 6 vs 8 on the D300s and the buffer is the achilles heel on this camera its limited to 100 photos and less in RAW since the files are huge.

Everyone else has already touted the specs so I am not going to repeat what has already been said. This camera is the BEST DSLR APS-C PERIOD - buy it and if you do not like it return it with Amazon's hassle-free return policy. There is a reason it is sold out everywhere it's THAT GOOD and for the MONEY it's a STEAL for all the features it has.

I am anxiously awaiting for the D800 and have my credit card open for when it comes out! Nikon the HIGH ISO champ will remain on top. Those who buy cameras based on Megapixels alone are missing out on this gem.",04-14-2011,04-14-2011

Previously I had a Pentax K10. I was looking to upgrade to the latest generation Pentax SLR. Pentax K10 has an unreliable autofocus system, this is more apparent when you upgrade to a better lens. I hoped the new Pentax K5 would solve my autofocus problems. Pentax K5 is overpriced and it looks the autofocus is better but not the best. On the other hand Nikon D7000 has a wonderful autofocus and the sensor is almost as good as the on in Pentax K5. As other reviewers mentioned a good autofocus is way more important than a sligtly better range for the the sensor.

I've got my own photography podcast (photographerandmodel.com/podcast) and website. I teach workshops along with my studio partners every month on model and studio photography.

I've been using a Nikon camera since 1984. For the past couple of years that has been the D90, but I just purchased the D7000 and I'm in love. It is without a doubt the coolest camera I've ever owned. Let me count the ways.

1) The video on this thing is stunning. I know, you probably aren't buying it for the video...or are you.  I bought the D90 hoping to play with video, but its video really kind of sucked. And it didn't have an audio in, which made the video almost useless. (You do realized half of the quality of video is the audio, right?)

All those things have been fixed in the D7000. The quality of the video is stunning. Everything looks like a motion picture. Rich colors, great depth of field. It is awesome.

Only nitpiks on the video, it is only 24 fps. That's fine for almost everything and contributes to the film like look, but it means you can't do really high quality slow motion.

You have to set some settings before going into video mode, most notably white balance.

Focusing is tough, but this is a function of everything DSLR where you are using the LCD to do focus manually. Auto focus kind of works, if you have a stationary target.

2) Image quality is great for stills too. I shoot a lot in the studio and in lower natural light and this camera is Great. Putting a bunch of images into Lightroom, some shot with the D90 and some the D7000 and you see the difference in quality right away.

I'm not one to say megapixels is everything, but with the same glass, the D7000's pictures are just sharper and cleaner.

3) There is lots of control. And controls. Which is a blessing and a curse. You can do anything, but there is a lot to learn to take advantage of everything. But I was able to put it in Auto and hand it to my non-photographer wife and she could take pictures with it.

Overall a great camera that I highly recommend.",04-05-2011,04-05-2011

I dropped off my D40 and 35mm 1.8 for cleaning/small repair and was told I'd be sans camera for 3 weeks.  So, I said ""screw it"" and bought this camera and the 50mm 1.8 as a kit.  At first, much like a new pair of shoes, I was disappointed.  But once I broke in the soles, so to speak, I forgot how much I had paid and started to really enjoy this device.  I've since taken over 5,000 photos with it on my recent travels.  If you are debating between this and a D700, get both, as this is far better as a walking-around camera and the DX lenses are cheaper.  Or, if you want to save come coin, get the perfectly good D3100.  But neither will be as much fun as this puppy.  Nice weight without being too heavy, deep grip, quick autofocus and intelligent auto mode, and great performance at high iso.  I even use live view as my dog gets scared when I disappear behind the viewfinder.  Even video isn't bad, though an external mic is required.  Just buy it and don't look back.",04-02-2011,04-02-2011

They pulled out all the stops for a camera of this class!!,"It took a while to get - and I guess they are still hard to find sometimes.  I got mine at the MSRP, I think it's shameful that some retailers are selling higher.  My biggest reason for buying this camera was the features and I haven't been disappointed so far.  The frame rate is so fast that I have to set it on CL to keep from constantly clicking off 2 frames when I only intend 1.  I have not noticed any of the hot pixels that some have complained about.  One of this cameras features that I like so much is it's low-light high-ISO range - def. better than my old D200, and better than the D300 also.  I didn't like that I had to buy SD cards, but I found some for a good price, and I do like the 2 slots for cards.  One thing I don't like - the counter is not accurate.  It shows that I can fit 225 images onto an 8G card, but really it's over 400 (at least it errs in a good way).  The battery life is exceptional in this camera - I shoot all day on one battery.  At least that makes up for not using the same battery as the D200 and now my D700.  One little thing I wish Nikon would have done a little better - only 3 shots on bracketing.  I do appreciate being able to bracket by 2 f/stops - the D300 and D700 will only do 1 stop at a time.  I also notice some exposure prob. with highlights, but nothing major.  Anyway - no regrets about this camera!!",03-29-2011,03-29-2011

Movie aspect is another story.  Junk!  Unless of course you do silent movies.  You will hear the lens, very loudly, foucusing and zooming (a little less when using a zoom).  If an external mic helps, nikon has some info on this on their website, then that is a min. of 75 more.  That was the least expensive mic they suggested/recomended.  If you fix the focus or use manual focus it will be ok.  That is the only work around. Focus, auto that is, is terrible. If the movie aspect was not a joke then I would have given this 5 stars.  I did not buy this for that aspect, however, Nikon is selling, marketing and pricing it this way. I may try the external mic but do not believe this will help much.
One other thing....Nikon support is terrible. Very few people know much about what Nikon sells.  As far as still imagaes are concerned ...they are great.  Better than my D200 at 400 and up  and better color out of the box than the D200 at any ISO.

Update:  I did not know but in live,  manual,movie view mode.  You CAN'T adjust Aperture....only ISO and Shutter.  you must exit live view, change the aperture, and go back.  Maybe I expect too much or do not know much about the video world...this is very possible.  If you want a sweet camera then this is a winner.  Also, it is very light weight.

Update 2:  Got the external mic.  Audio Technica here at Amazon.  Better but still not worth it.  You will still hear the lens motor. I have a S lens...silent wave.  Focus sucks in live mode.

There are so many review about the still capability already. But the controlls of the video is OK but could be better.

I played with the Nikon d7000 video a little.  I even bought a Steadicam Jr for it. It took me a couple day to figure out I had to make an adapter plate to make the Steadicam work.  I added a quick release so I can use the camera on the Steadicam Jr and take the camera off quickly.  Here is my observation of the using nikon D7000 for video.

1) There is no remote start/stop to turn the video on and off to be use on the steadicam Jr or similar stabilizer.  I have to catch the ""floating"" camera on the Steadicam Jr to turn the recording on and off. So a time delay or remote switch to turn on the video is impossible?

2) The D7000 camera is very ""rear"" heavy to compare with a ""normal"" camcorder.  I made an adapter plate to allow the d7000 to work on the Steadicam Jr. Once the adapter plate is installed the Steadicam Jr works fine.

3) There is no motorized zoom on the D7000 and zooming is not going to be smooth. It is almost impossible not to stop the recording on the Steadicam Jr to zoom.

4) The built-in microphone is so close to the lens, it is picking up the noise of the lens motor when auto focusing is in action.  I am using a old zoom 24-120mm without the silent wave motor.  Other lense could be better.

5) I also bought the IR remote controller, however, it will only control the shutter, it will not start/stop of the video remotely.

6) No through the lens view finder to see the video means it is difficult if not impossible to take video under bright sun light.

So I'll share a few early impressions while they are still fresh in my mind. First off as others have pointed out this camera has a real Quality feel to it. Nothing at all like the Canon T2i and other enthusiast level cameras. It feels rock solid and very well put together. Weight wise it's not a lightweight by any means but it's nowhere near as large and heavy as the pro cameras. Still with the Nikon 70-300 VR attached I was glad to have ordered a fancy padded neck strap with it as I spend long days aboard my boat as a marine photographer shooting photos of watercraft, as well as long days in the mountains hiking rugged trails and shooting landscapes. In terms of being user friendly almost all of the controls are logically organized and conveniently placed. Compared to the Olympus E-300 that's been my workhorse unit for the past few years the D7000 is a virtual paragon of good design. This is a good thing because  this is one very feature rich camera with so many bells and whistles that Nikon could easily (and profitably) offer doctoral programs in its use.

My short lived love affair with Japanese factory manuals died a sudden death in 1984 when the manual that came with my Toyota pickup truck advised me to ""Not use windshield wipers on dry grass!"" And no, the last word is not a typo, that is precisely what the manual said. So even before ordering my new D7000 from B&H I ordered a 3rd party D7000 manual from Alibras. When it arrived I was all but overwhelmed by the complexity of this camera. Menus have submenus, and submenus have endless choices. The mere thought of someone new to digital photography buying this camera makes me glad I don't sell cameras for a living! Sure, as with any complex tool you can ""Grow  into it"" but believe you me there are going to be some growing pains for those just becoming involved in digital photography! I should, in fairness, add that the factory manual accompanying the D7000 is not bad at all. In fact I would say it's one of the best Japanese manuals I've ever read.

Happily by the time I had read a few hundred pages things began to look doable if I'd just hang in there and get the basics down. In fairness to the D7000 I should point out here that I've allowed myself to fall way behind when it comes to camera technology. Someone moving to the D7000 from a D90 or one of the many other later vintage enthusiast cameras put out by others won't face anywhere near as steep a learning curve.

Speaking of which, even when things go bad there is often a bright side to it. To whit, the first time I took the D7000 out to make some images I managed to set the auto ISO feature incorrectly and thus wound up with 25 shots taken at an ISO of 3200! The bright side of this was that I'd been duplicating all the images shot with the D7000 with my trusty Olympus E-300 set at an ISO of 100. Now the E-300 is no slouch when it comes to image quality but low noise is not one of its strong points. Still, when I discovered I'd shot all the D7000 images at an ISO of 3200 I felt confident that the ISO 100 shots I'd made with my E-300 would be far superior. Imagine my shock when I discovered that was simply not the case.  Quite the contrary, the D7000 images were superior! Wondering if this was a fluke I shot some photos of my cat in available light the next day at an ISO of 2500 and then compared them with the best images I've taken with the E-300 over the past several years at an ISO of 100. If you can believe this the D7000 shots were heads and shoulders better. In fact, the best shot of the bunch was shot with the Nikon 70-300 VR lens at a setting equal to 380 mm, at a shutter speed of 1/30"" and an F stop of 5.6 and it was simply stunning! Every whisker sharp as a tack!

So, it's fair to say that based on my initial experience with the D7000 I am quite pleased. I will get back with further comments after I've shot a few  thousand more frames.

12/17/2011

Well I'm back. Having shot 15,000+ frames with my D7000 I can only say that I grow ever more impressed with this camera. Image quality is simply superb! I commonly get images of a quality I simply would never have believed possible back when in the 1970s when I was a full time photojournalist shooting with top of the line Nikons and film. High ISO performance is also spectacular and I constantly have to fight my fear that bumping up the ISO will cause radical dropoff in image quality as was the case with my previous Olympus E-300 camera. While it's always wise to shoot at the lowest ISO practical I've found that anything up to 1000 is just fine for most of my work. Image stabilization with my AFS NIkkor 70-300mm G is also superb! In truth my use of a tripod has dropped more than 75% since the purchase of this camera and lens. I am constantly astounded by how low I can go shutter speed wise while handholding this outfit!!!! Simply unbelievable at times how good the images are shot handheld at shutter speeds of less than 1/60"" with a 300mm lens.

Any complaints? Well yes, there are a few. I find the control knob devoted to mode selection is very easy to rotate by accident...it needs a locking mechanism like that supplied for the release mode control beneath it. More times than I like to think of I've had a shot spoiled as a result of the mode selection having been shifted accidently.  I would also like to see the AE-L AF-L button repositioned to the right as it's a long reach with my right thumb while continuing to maintain pressure on the shutter button. I do have small hands so this might not be quite as serious a problem for those with larger hands. Perhaps my biggest gripe is with the dust reduction feature. Simply put my British mother would say this is ""Rubbish!"" Within weeks of using my D7000 I was seeing dozens of dust specks on the sensor and when I use apertures smaller than F!0 I have to devote a lot of time to retouching them out in Lightroom. And this despite the fact that I seldom change lenses and when I do I do so following scrupulous dust avoidence techniques. By contrast the dust reduction in my Olympus E-300 (many years out of date!) rates a 10 out of 10 score while the D7000 rates a 2 out of 10 score. With Olympus currently in terrible financial trouble the time is ripe for Nikon to approach them behind closed doors with an offer to license the Olympus dust reduction system for Nikon cameras. It would be the best investment Nikon ever made.

Finally, how about the issue of the D7000 meter consistently overexposing images? Well I have had some problems with this but have found the difficulty mostly related to how the metering system factors in color differences in light reflectivity. There is a wonderfully clear section on this in David Burchs D7000 manual and once you read it most if not of your overexposure problems will vanish.",03-02-2011,03-02-2011

If you currently own a D80 the upgrade is a no-brainer. Just do it, you won't regret it. If you're using a D90, as I was before, you may be considering the upgrade to a D7000 a bit more skeptically.

I am a serious amateur/hobbyist with more than 50 years of experience in photography, and have progressed from a D50 to a D80 to a D90 (each owned for two years), to the D7000 purchased two months ago.

Initially I wondered if the upgrade from a D90 would really be worth it. Well, it definitely is. The D7000 isn't an upgrade to the D90 in the traditional sense that we tend to think of upgrades, it's a whole NEW CAMERA. The improvements I'm most impressed with that matter most to me personally for my kind of photography?

1. New sensor with greater dynamic range and superior high-ISO performance. The first DX body to come close to approximating FX cameras in these areas.

2. New 39-point AF module that puts the D80 and D90's 11-point AF to shame in AF-C and makes easy work of any kind of action photography. Not only faster and more precise autofocusing, but also a significantly improved method for quickly choosing different AF modes.

3. Improved layout of buttons and controls on the body, but with a nearly identical menu structure to the D90 that makes it easy to learn and implement everything, including the D7000's new features. The learning curve should be minimal coming from a D80 or D90. And there are enough similarities to the D300 to make it an easy transition.

4. Metering, especially matrix metering, is more accurate in a wider variety of lighting conditions -- definitely improved over the D90 and a major improvement over the D80. A camera's meter readings are always suggestions, not commandments, and EV compensation is often necessary. But the D7000's matrix metering gets the exposure very close to right the vast majority of the time.

5. The D7000's light touch (hair trigger) shutter release takes a little getting used to, but it definitely minimizes the chance of camera motion blur when taking a picture. I understand that D300 and D700 users won't notice much difference in the touch, but it's a major improvement if you're coming from any of Nikon's consumer DSLRs.

6. The 6 fps continuous mode is plenty fast enough to capture very fast action like birds in flight. And the new dial configuration makes it easier than ever to change shooting modes quickly.

7. Programmable U1 and U2 modes eliminate time-consuming menu diving and button pushing when you want to switch instantaneously between settings for different situations (landscape or scenic shots vs. action photography, for example).

8. The introduction of several ""pro body features"" in a consumer camera like AF fine tuning, which is not something you need all the time or want to use indiscriminately, but it's wonderful to have when you need it.

9. Better construction gives the D7000 a ""pro feel"" not present in other consumer grade Nikon bodies. A subjective opinion, I know, but just picking up a D7000 tells you that you're handling a very solid, serious piece of equipment.

10. Yes, we all bemoaned the introduction of a new D7000 battery. But this new EN-EL15 is a powerhouse that will give the Energizer Bunny a run for his money. A very positive new enhancement.

11. Last but not least (lest we forget the real purpose of a camera), I am taking better pictures (technically, at least) with my D7000 than I did with my D90 -- and doing so much more easily and efficiently. Compared to the 2-3 months it took me to adapt to the D80 and D90 when I upgraded to those bodies before I began getting really satisfactory results, there hasn't been any such prolonged learning curve with my D7000.

I have not commented on the D7000's video capabilities because I don't shoot video with it. I have noted that autofocusing with any lens in Live View is rather slow, even in good light, and many lenses may have difficulty achieving an accurate focus lock in low light. And a few lenses may fail to autofocus in Live View at all. This is not really important to me because I very rarely use this feature, but it is something to be aware of.

A word about lenses: Achieving the best results with the higher resolution of the 16MP D7000 does require good lenses. The 18-105 VR kit lens is adequate and will yield perfectly satisfactory results. However, obtaining the superior image quality that the camera is capable of calls for better quality glass. For an excellent general purpose ""walkaround"" lens that is also a Best Buy at $449, I personally recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sigma-17-70mm-f-2-8-4-DC-Macro-OS-HSM-Lens-for-Nikon-Mount-Digital-SLR-Cameras/dp/B002ZNJB2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sigma 17-70mm f/2.8-4 DC Macro OS HSM Lens for Nikon Mount Digital SLR Cameras</a>.

I hope Amazon shoppers for the D7000 body only who thinking of upgrading from a previous DSLR find my observations helpful.

UPDATE ON 03/16/11 --

Here is a link to my Flickr photostream if you would like view some of the photos I have taken with the D7000. They include the EXIF info and were taken with the Sigma 17-70mm f/2.8-4 DC Macro OS HSM and Nikon 70-300 VR.

[...]

One feature I didn't mention in my original review is in-camera editing. This is not something new, but it's much more robust in the D7000 and I use it quite a bit. For example, JPEG shooters will appreciate the in-camera WB adjustment that lets you correct color balance that's way off right in the camera and then make subtle adjustments in post processing. Likewise, in-camera B&W and sepia conversions produce images with a full tonal gradient for later creative manipulation on the computer. Both of these are handy time-savers, and your original image always remains intact. The in-camera cropping options have also been expanded to include virtually all of the popular formats and provide excellent flexibility for basic cropping.

The more I use my D7000, the more I appreciate what a significant upgrade it is to the D90.",02-15-2011,02-15-2011

After a couple of months with the D7000, I am disappointed in that the sharpness of the images taken with the new one is noticeably less than those of the D80. I tested using the same lens, 18-200, not a particularly sharp lens, but the one I have used regularly, same subjects --- and when looked at at 100% magnification, the difference was very noticeable: the D7000 with a larger sensor is just not as sharp.

I also made a comparison, also of flowers in bright light, using a 35MM 1.8 DX and, again, the D80 was superior in both sharpness and also, with this lens, in color quality. I've noticed that the D7000 tends to overexpose.

I should have done these tests immediately on getting the camera, while I could still return it to Amazon, but now two and half months later, I am stuck with what may be a lemon, so be forewarned. I used it only a little, liked its other qualities but image quality is paramount for me --- and I thought it might be my error. It's really disappointing.",02-10-2011,02-10-2011

I knew my next dslr would be the D90 or better.  What I wanted was the dual scroll wheels and 1980x1080p video recording features and this totally delivered.  Also a bump in megapixal and the new cmos sensor with better iso for low lighting would sweeten the deal.  I carried over the Nikon 18-200vr, 50mm 1.8 and 35mm 1.8 from my old D40.

Photos:
I been shooting this camera since the first week of November 2010 and have taken about 4000 shots/some movie clips.  At first I thought the image was a little soft.  The poster on this d7000 forum told me how to fixed it in the menu and all is fine now.  I am finally getting night shots, when I did night photo stroll with my friends the D40 was too slow and my iso skill back then wasn't great.  Since I gotten this I played with almost every buttons and setting and actually shot aperture priority now, I been using the Nikon present for the D40.

Movies mode:
I am still learning this, getting things to focus on the fly.  It does continuous autofocusing, but not as zippy as the Sony A33 I played with.  Overall the movies I made are fun, but in no way anything you see on blu-ray 1980x1080p.  I find that I do a better job of manual focus and it is much quieter.  I plug an external microphone to this and it really is a benefit to filming with audio for less background noise.

Positives:
+Great photos, Sony newest CMOS is good for low lighting.
+Camera Body motor, I have a 50mm 1.8 that I can finally use.
+ISO looks very good, once I leave 1600, I can notice some different
+more external buttons, entry level camera like the D40 uses the submenu too much.
+Bigger body and sturdier magnesium alloy material, I like that in my hands with the rubber insert.
+LCD screen is much improved, now I do know if a shot is good or bad.
+Live view photography, I don't use it much but I like the option too.
+Nikon Service, I called about the stuck pixel in Movie mode, they said wait for the firmware, and it got fixed.
+Nikon ViexNX is good for quick adjustment.
+1080p 24fps Movie mode with continuous auto-focus(like I said not as zippy as Sony, but much quieter) I made a few youtube videos now.

Neutral:
Battery is bigger and more expensive then before.  I Since I record clip more it is hard to compare to the D40 which just took pictures.  I get 350-400 shots before I recharge.  Some people claim 1000 shots per charge, but that is not me.  My 4000shot has
has 5-6 charges already.

Negative:
-GPS, if the Sony A55 with the same cmos as this can have one for cheaper, why not the D7000.
-I was hoping it be around $1000.  The Sony A33 and A55 are much cheaper, with the same cmos.

Overall I like the pictures that I got from the D7000, and all the external layout.  I can bracket shots with ease, for HDR editing photoshop of course.  I don't have to go into the submenu to turn on the remote.  I even used the continuous burst for once.  The Nikon ViexNX is a good software for quick fix like for contrast and sharpening.  It is no way a Lightroom or Photoshop replacement, nope.  It can edit video too, but I just use the Window Media player on Win7.  I added the SB-700 to this camera and the two work well together, ie the wireless flash.  I have/carry this camera around me like a cellphone.",02-08-2011,02-08-2011

If money is tough for you and you have to decide to upgrade, I would keep the D90 or if you wondering whether to jump to the D300s...I wouldn't. The almost $500-6000 dollar jump to the D300s in my opinion isn't worth it. Plus it has less megapixels, but then again pixels aren't a big issue with photography.

Once I was able to drop the $1200 all I could find was the kits and I really didn't want the lens that came with it so I waited. And waited. And waited some more. It took almost 3 months for me to find just the body, and I must admit that it was well worth the wait.

From the get go, I noticed the mirror slap was much quieter than that of my D200 and I found it to be a pleasing sound. Definitely better for stealthier situations. It was also immediately apparent that the body was smaller than the D200 as well, but not so much so that I could feel a big difference while shooting. Another thing that I noticed was that the larger display was crystal clear and a nice upgrade. The general controls on the body were similar enough to the D200 that it didn't take me too long to figure most of them out, but there were a few options that I had to consult the manual to figure out; specifically, changing the flash mode and trying to figure out where the shutter release cable plugged into. The user menu is similar as well so I had little trouble setting up my normal shooting parameters.

I was very pleased to see that the D7000 wasn't nearly the battery hog that the 200 is. I purchased a spare battery and the MBD11 ""multi-power"" battery pack and got roughly 3,000 frames from the first battery. That's over double what I would get from the D200 and the BP that accompanied it.

There are a few other improvements over the D200 that I have noticed as well. The exposure metering seems more accurate and the AF motor is quieter too. I love the 16 MP images (twice that of my previous body) and despite my initial apprehensions, I even like the dual SDHC card slots though I wish I could still use my collection of CF cards. The auto white balance is HUGELY improved over the D200. I would usually do a custom WB for each lighting situation I would encounter. The D7000 has yet to be taken out of Auto WB mode and the results are more than acceptable.

The noise at higher ISO settings is greatly reduced in comparison. I get more noise shooting with the D200 @ ISO 1600 than I do with the D7000 with the ISO @ 6400. And the fact that I can go to 6400 makes the camera all the better.

Then there's the built in intervalometer which gives the D7000 the ability to automatically shoot one frame per second for up to 999 seconds. This is the feature that I was most excited to use and have used it a few times already. I am a huge fan of time lapse photography and now I have the ability to do TL projects. My only gripe is that the camera's internal software limits us to just 999 frames. That's only 16.25 minutes of shooting when taking one frame per second and when you make your movie (which is normally @ 24 frames per second) that works out to roughly 42 seconds of TL video per session.

Speaking of video, that is another feature that I was very excited over and I am looking forward to using when opportunities arise. I have used the camera in video mode all of once in the past six weeks and I am not completely happy with the results. In all fairness though, I am sure that the issues I have with the videos shot are more from operator error than they are from the camera. I really need to read the section of the manual pertaining to the video capabilities before I say anything unflattering.

As time goes on and I've had a chance to give the camera even more of a work out, I will make any necessary amendments to this review.

Strengths:
16 MP
ISO range from 100 to 6400 (25,600 on the ""H settings)
6 FPS
Built in intervalometer
Greatly improved auto white balance
100% View Finder

Depends what you need it for, its fast but has a limited buffer, so not great for capturing sports, probably not bad, but you don't want to base your livelihood on this body for that.  Otherwise, its a tough and thoughtfully made camera, should last a long time.

I wish I could love it, but this review is for those interested in true hybrid shooting: switching on-the-fly between still image capture and digital filming. I've been trying to find the right camera to use in the field when I have to shoot both stills and short film clips. A ""perfect"" camera doesn't need add-ons to do that... the Nikon D7000 does need them. I'm not hating on the D7000 because Nikon's definitely going in the right direction (by adding things like a socket for an external mic - something that the D90 sorely lacked. It also adds manual adjustment for film recording (people like calling it ""video"" but iPhones take video ... I want to go beyond that YouTube mentality).

The D7000 also sports that wonderful 5-6 fps still image capture. Not just a burst of 6 frames, but constant. In Jpeg mode, you can sit on the shutter and capture dozens of images. With the setting in Raw, you can only capture a handful of NEF files before the camera needs to come up for air to write; the image size is actually larger than the D3/D3S.

Now for what I feel is the drawback on the hybrid build of these cameras: Each one that has a mirror for shooting images means that you cannot use the eyepiece to shoot clips. Which means that you have to use the rear LCD screen to frame and capture. Taking that camera from cradle shooting (where you cradle the camera in your hands holding it to your eye) will yield camera shake when you extend a two-pound camera away from your body to shoot. And forget about fine-focusing if you're farsighted.

You also can't control sound like the camcorders like the ones with the XLR microphone jacks. Our boss plans to get an audio integrator, but they cost $399, and add bulk which goes against the desire to have an camera that doesn't attract attention.

One can add a viewfinder for the LCD screen (like the Hoodman) which acts as a loupe, but if you're into shooting both stills and clips, your eye won't be able to access the prism viewfinder. In my own opinion, the need to add these accessories means that development of a great field-use hybrid still has a way to go. I think these cameras should eliminate the shutter mirror. It would allow you to keep the camera close to your face and quickly and seamlessly switch between clips and images. The hybrid camera is moving on a course where this should hopefully happen. I think Lumix now has some cameras that are mirror-free and use an LCD viewfinder. But their image quality is still lacking.

Is it that photographers don't want to shoot using an LCD screen? Is there a problem with image jumping when a still is captured, where the image shows for a moment, or breaks away from the live action? I've noticed that with the Lumix cameras that I've shot with, and it makes it difficult to shoot something like football. Focusing isn't nearly as precise as using a prism viewfinder. Some people may be chomping at the bit thinking I'm hating you new-found gem. But I only want to focus on what others genuinely missed in their reviews. It's easy to talk about all that stuff that most write about. But I think this is an important aspect that needs to be explained, for those who want to use a similar camera as a standalone hybrid. We don't have the budget or desire to but external sound boxes, 8-inch monitors, and camera stabilizers. We just want to switch between video and stills without having to add extra gear or move the camera away from our eyes.",01-27-2011,01-27-2011

2 iso 25600 and 5d2 are at a comparable level; I personally feel that the ISO difference between D7000 and 5d2 is less than 3/1 stop apart (5d2 is still better)

3 Color is not so yellow compared to many other Nikon Cameras

4 Live view focus is fast; faster than canon 7d, 60d and 5d2

5 Feel good to hold it

6 Dead Pixels are yet to be seen

7 Great shutter life, much better than canon 60d

8 MUCH BETTER dynamic range than any of the CANON camera I have used",01-24-2011,01-24-2011

I have Nikon system since 1980s. I have no other choice but to buy a Nikon DLSR unless I have to replace my whole system, which is too costly for me now. With years of experience in photography, I rate this camera a 3 star. Nikon is slow in DLSR technology and very stingy in offering to its users.

The camera is feature rich, which does not require me to say. However, it gave me frustrations at basic levels for photography. Personally, its new 39 point focus system is with major flaws. It cannot focus when I try to take pictures at my nephews birthday party. The light condition was NOT bad. The lens was 28-70 f2.8 AFS. The auto focus setting was 39 points Auto-A. I tried to use manual focus override but the two focus indicator arrow kept blinking and the in focus circle never came up. No focus point was highlighted. The camera locked up. I had switch the camera off and on. The problem repeated several times while I was taking pictures at the party. The same lens was used on this D7000 to take 500 pictures before this happened. And it never happened again with the same lens and camera for the next 500 pictures. It was this particular scene where the camera failed on me. If you read reviews from dpreview.com and popular photography etc., you will find its picture quality is OK but no upto the competitions at this price level. Poor video shooting.

There is only minimun improvement on resolution compared to D90, while its color accuracy and noise level are worse. The new focus system is a joke, making no improvement over D90, speed and accuracy. Nikon knows

If you ask my advice, my answer is: if you have to buy a Nikon, then swallow it; If you start new or have money to start a new system, do not buy Nikon. You can get much better value somewhere else.",01-19-2011,01-19-2011

I am using a 28-300mm Nikor lens with VRII stabilization. The lens is used in all modes, selected on the lens body. The camera is the D7000. The lens was paired with an expensive hoya ultra-violet filter. The camera was NOT upgraded to the latest firmware.

Overall this is a remarkable camera. It is incredibly fast to select the focus and light balance - press the button and it takes the photograph almost instantly - a huge improvement over my D70 and D90 cameras.

The negative criticism is as follows:

First the camera over exposes photographs in high light level conditions. On the other hand, it is perfect for night-time or low light conditions. In high light, I switch to the 'P' mode and select two stops darker than recommended by the camera. This gives consistently good pictures in higher light levels (cloudless skies for instance). In night time conditions I select 'Auto' mode and get good results.

In the 1080p movie modes I see red pixels in the right hand, upper quadrant back-panel. However in the actual content when transferred to computer these fixed red pixels are completely missing. I am told a firmware upgrade MIGHT fix this. The locked pixels are NOT visible in normal photograph modes.

The camera records H264 in motion modes. This will need to be translated to 4:2:2 mpeg2 for most decent editors.

The focus is hard to force to a specific depth. I want to eliminate foreground fencing and fix to the background focal length - it is a struggle to get the camera to do this - not impossible but you need to read the manual. By comparison the D70 selected the right focal length 80-90% of the time. I feel the camera could benefit from firmware refinement here.

After setting up the U1 and U2 program settings I can get consistent results of the highest order (U1 is set for lo-lite, no-flash and U2 is set for hi-lite, panoramic conditions).

Overall this is a fantastic camera BUT you should be aware of the following:

1. The camera was released ""early"" and definitely needs some refinement - get the latest firmware updates
2. The choice of filter is critical. Not all filters work for this camera and you may need some trial-and-error to find the best match. I had a range of twenty filters for the lens, but only four worked out as good choices. If you get bad results, remember the filter MIGHT be the problem.
3. This camera is good, even great, but it is not perfect. Play around with the settings, the filters, the lenses. If you are patient you will get outstanding results in a wide range of light conditions. I am retiring my earlier Nikon cameras, several lenses and even more filters (at least until I figure out how to use them on this camera).
4. Your older lenses will typically not make full use of this camera, but most of them will work - a sigma lens went through excessive 'hunting' until I removed the filter. I bought a new Nikor/Nikon VR lens with this camera and was impressed. I am retaining about three lenses from my extensive collection including a Macro, panoramic and linear zoom. But I was suitably impressed by the stabilization modes in the new lens. I believe other manufacturers have equivalent solutions. I was shocked by the effectiveness of the image stabilization at 300mm in low light conditions. So I recommend you try at least one VRII (or equivalent) lens with this camera. Focus lock times are similarly exemplary.

Despite the above review I absolutely love this camera. I would like to slap Nikon management around the head for their premature release of this camera given the state of firmware development. The VRII lenses are literally amazing. I took night-time shots of fireworks and Christmas lights at the zoo in Las Vegas and the results were exceptional. I dealt with the 'daytime' issues and also got great results.

This is NOT the ultimate camera. It needs around 40M Pixel resolution and a smarter computer or at least better firmware. It is also abundantly clear that Nikon underestimated demand and then, rather cynically, forced many buyers to cough up another $200-$400 for a mostly-useless pre-packaged lens. Rubbish management! The 28-300 or an 18-200+ are the minimum lens you should consider unless you have lenses for earlier Nikon cameras. Overall, however, we are rapidly approaching perfection. Now all I need is a mode that analyzes ""great"" photos from mere snapshots!",01-05-2011,01-05-2011

Suffice it to say, it is the best DX camera on the market today, and it is as good or better than the Nikon D700 (I own that one too) even though the D7000 is DX format, and the D700 is FX format, which should give better quality.  With the D7000 DX you can use the smaller and lighter DX lenses, meaning you get to carry a smaller bag...great for travel and good for your neck!

As others have I'm sure noted, the D700 and higher end models do perform slightly better in very low light without flash, running at very high ISO settings. No question, if you are shooting this way...usually meaning sports or wildlife, and you are very serious about it, then you are going to have to have an FX type camera too.

If you're like me, however, you'll still mostly pack your DX SLR...and to me, that is now hands down the D7000. It is great camera, and quite easy to use too.",01-03-2011,01-03-2011

It is impossible to get a sharp picture with 16mm when shooting at a close distance, say, within 10 feet. The focus point did not seem shift a lot. It was just quite blurry even at the focus point. 35mm has back focus issue and the image was blurry too, just a little bit better than 16mm. 70-300 is much better. I used the same lens with D300s and the picture was much sharper. I guess something wrong with D7000's focus system.

While the D300s was (and is) an excellent still camera, the video support left something to be desired.  I ran the same test (and added some bonus footage) on the D7000 in this video review.

I'm happy to say that a majority of the video issues have been resolved in this new iteration.  Rolling shutter is still an issue, but it's vastly improved. As you can see from my Thanksgiving footage the video is steady and smooth even without a tripod.  The ""jelly vision"" that plagued the D300s is largely gone.

As a still camera the D7000 raises the bar over prior Nikon mid-level cameras.  While it's slightly slower than the D300s for stills, it feels a lot more ""pro"" than the D90 it replaces.  The D7000 is constructed out of a durable magnesium alloy body, sports two SD card slots, and has absolutely stunning low-light high ISO performance.  You won't need the flash often with a fast lens.

Resolution and image quality is also improved.  The camera shoots at 16.2 megapixels, a decent bump in resolution from the prior model.  The D7000's DX ""crop sensor"" also means higher pixel density than more expensive Nikon cameras that shoot full frame - great for doing ""crop and zooms.""

Bottom line:  this is the camera I was hoping the D300s would be.  Excellent stills, durable construction, and outstanding video.  It's a worthy replacement of both the D90 and D300s and can easily fit into a professional or semi-professional environment.",12-29-2010,12-29-2010

I've been shooting Nikon exclusively for years.  Buying a new body comes down to one thing:  I already own Nikon lenses, so I buy Nikon bodies.  F3, D70.  D200.  Now the D7000.  I've owned this since the week it was introduced.  I love this camera.  All of it.  No need to repeat what you can read in all the other reviews.  It truly rocks in every sense of the word.
My only disappointment is this:  Autofocus during video is a joke.  It shouldn't even be listed as a feature.  If this is a major selling point for you, buy the camera anyway but know ahead of time this feature blows.  I pray to _____ (deity of choice) that there will be a firmware fix for this.
I know, I know... true video aficionados don't use auto focus.  But sometimes it's nice to have the option, right?  Well you don't.
I shoot lots of video and manual focus on this thing is not for the faint of heart.  I have a shoulder rig with a follow focus and a screen magnifier and I work hard pulling focus, especially with subjects on the move.

If you're on a budget I also believe you can get a camera nearly as capable for under $500!  You don't need to spend $1200 on a camera, but if you're so inclined I don't think you'll regret it. The D7000 offers the best Dynamic Range I've seen from any DSLR at any price and nearly the best: Signal to Noise Ratio, Tonal Range, and Color Sensitivity; That plus two user modes, two card slots, more focus points, plus more ways to customize your camera, and make taking photos faster and easier, make it a pretty great camera in my view.

The controls are very intuitive and easy to find your way around. 1 con however is that the light meter is not visible on the top LCD panel. It is only found inside the viewfinder of the camera.

It's subtle, but at this price point, improvements are incremental but vastly appreciated.  This camera just captures the finest color gradations in dimly lit shaded areas or even in very low light. I'm sure it's a combination of better image sensor technology and improvements in the processing engine (software side).  Proper use of white balance and ISO are also critical to really nail colors and fidelity. It's also an extremely responsive camera.  Just fires away.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Having owned the D90 since fall 2008, before breaking it a couple months ago, I can tell you the D7000 is a big step up in a few key areas, although they're not necessarily related to picture quality (never would have bought one if my D90 was still alive).  The D7000 focuses faster and with more intelligence as it has many more focus points (39 versus 11).  The new shutter system is extremely quick and quiet.  The VIDEO, especially now that it supports 720P at 30fps, is hugely improved, and I've found snagging quick vids of the kids has become invaluable.  I see no need to shoot 1080p, which is just overkill.

But, the D7000 really is aimed at the insatiable enthusiast who'll never leave the camera set on ""A.""  The D7000 is meant to be tweaked and customized beyond what a cheaper camera might allow.  If you're only seeking a camera with zero shutter lag that offers cleaner shots with better colors, deeper blacks, and those blurry backgrounds, then any cheaper D-SLR will do, especially the D3100 (if you're a Nikon fan).  Don't bother spending the cash on the D7000 if you don't plan on READING the entire manual, exploring the vast menus, buying several lenses, and relentlessly seeking alternative ways to capture images.",12-15-2010,12-15-2010
https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D7000-DSLR-Body-Only/dp/B0042X9LC4?th=1,29,Electronics,Nikon D7000 DSLR (Body Only) (OLD MODEL),4.6,5,Nikon's Best DX Camera,"I bought my D7000 as an upgrade from my D80, which was itself an upgrade from the D50. I'm not one to buy a new dSLR every couple of years; I have been wanting to migrate from the D80 for awhile now because I don't like its meter, which consistently overexposed and blew out the highlights in pictures. I considered the D90, of course, but it wasn't quite enough to make me take the plunge. The D7000 is. I don't understand Nikon's naming convention on this camera, though: Prior to this, the pro-level cameras had one numeric digit (D1, D2, D3), the enthusiast-level cameras had two digits (D40-D60 for lower end, D70-D90 for higher end), and the newer consumer-level cameras had four digits (D3100, D5000). The D7000 in no way belongs in the same class as any consumer-grade camera. Nikon may have created an entirely different class of dSLR here. It beats every two-digit camera they've made, and might even render the amazing D300s largely irrelevant, but that's just an opinion. So, Nikon's inconsistent nomenclature notwithstanding, this camera is fantastic in nearly every way.

Suffice it to say that anyone interested in this camera knows the specs. Nothing in the marketing blurbs, however, can convey the way the D7000 feels and operates in the hands of a photographer. This camera just hums. It feels solid and professional, the buttons and dials are thoughtfully placed (no surprise there... ergonomics and build quality are why I shoot with Nikon), and the performance is just breathtaking. The D7000 borrows numerous features from its pro-grade lineup, such as blazing speed (largely unnecessary but still impressive at 6 fps), magnesium alloy body, virtual horizon, user-defined controls for entire banks of settings, etc. And it gets some features of its own, like 14-bit processing, a new processing engine, a newly-designed 16.2 MP sensor, vastly improved metering (much better than my D80), an intervalometer (for unsupervised timed interval shooting), and 100% viewfinder coverage. A full range of ""live"" adaptive dynamic range lighting control (called ""D-lighting"") is available, including an ""AUTO"" setting my D80 lacked. This really helps with high-contrast scenes, preserving the detail in the light areas while bringing out some of the details in the shadows. Focusing is fast, fast, fast, even with my non-Nikkor lens, which had regular problems on the D80. The D7000 manages it perfectly. Obviously, performance with my Nikkor lenses is silent, fast, and flawless. All of this translates into a remarkable experience for the experienced photographer. Playback is great too -- fast response when zooming (including diagonal zooming), and a new feature called ""Face Playback"" or something like that which is actually as useful as it is gimmicky, unlike most things like this which are more gimmicky than useful in real-world applications. When zooming in on a photo with people in it, the screen puts a small white box around all the faces. Set the zoom level, then use the front dial button to move instantly from face to face. Use the main (rear) dial to move to the next picture at the same zoom level. It's really useful and fun for checking to see if everyone is smiling and has their eyes open in a group photo. It's definitely gimmicky, since it's not strictly necessary, but in this case, it's actually quite useful, too. I enjoy this feature.

The menus are logically laid out, and pressing the ""?"" button offers more in-depth information on any of the myriad features and functions in the menus. Everything is HIGHLY customizable... you can easily spend several hours playing with menu settings, but owing to Nikon's liberal sprinkling of dedicated buttons and controls on the D7000 body, you won't need to dive into the menus very often after the initial tweaks are made. The superb degree of customization possible is what pushes the D7000 solidly into the very high end of enthusiast cameras. If you tend to leave your dSLR set on AUTO nearly all the time, don't waste the money on the D7000; buy the excellent D3100 instead. It's got many of the same features for half the price.

Battery life on the D7000 is completely insane. For even an enthusiast shooter, one full charge can easily last a week of shooting 100+ photos per day. Going on a weekend vacation? A week? Leave the charger at home. I took it on a six-day trip to Thailand and lost only one segment on the battery meter during that time (although to be fair, I didn't shoot hundreds and hundreds of photos). The D7000 is rated at 1,050 shots per charge, and I believe it based on my own usage so far. This is nothing particularly jaw-dropping for me, though: the D80 battery lasts forever, too. I also love the twin SD card slots with their multiple options for use: overflow, backup, dedicated video/RAW assignment... brilliant.

As reported, low-light performance is excellent, particularly with a fast lens. Even with a standard f/3.5 zoom, the lack of noise in ISOs up to 1600 means you won't be popping that flash up very often. I use my SB-600 speedlight now almost exclusively for wireless creative lighting techniques, not to actually supply light needed for a photo. At ISO 800, shooting handheld indoors is a breeze. When you do use the flash (for fill-flash situations, for example), it's pretty much perfect, typical for Nikon.

This is a serious rival for Canon's 60D, which I'd suggest is the D7000's only real competition in this class of dSLR. I'd say the D7000 beats the 60D in most real-world respects (though some of that is based on my own preference for Nikon's ergonomics), although I understand the 60D is superb for video. I'm not a videographer, so I can't really comment on that. (I can add that, in playing around with it, I do find the autofocusing during video shooting to be pretty bad.) The vast majority of the time, I'll be using my D7000 for still photography. I'd take the D7000 over the D300s, and the doubling of price doesn't warrant the purchase of the fantastic D700 (for me, at least).

I was lucky to get this camera at all given Nikon's continuing supply/demand issues. Even though it was released three months ago, it's near-impossible to find it in stock anywhere. I live outside the US currently and was, happily, able to get a D7000 body at a Nikon retailer for about the same price (when converted) as it should sell for in the States, about $1,200.

Money well-spent, I must say.

For me, upgrading from the D80, the chief improvements were:

 - The meter. Metering on the D80 was pretty bad, in all honesty. The D7000 is far, far better at reading the light, which is the most crucial point of photography. This excellent full-color RGB meter, in concert with active D-lighting (for high-contrast scenes), and seriously intelligent metering algorithms, makes getting the ""right shot"" much more effortless.

 - White balance. One of the most critical settings in digital photography, and the D7000 handles it brilliantly with so many nuanced settings and adjustments possible. Love it.

 - Fantastic high-ISO performance. I rarely ever use the built-in flash and when I use my SB-600, it's typically off-camera use for fun or creative lighting effects. The D7000 handles low-light shooting amazingly well, especially when used with a fast lens like my Nikkor 35mm f/1.8 prime. Even with a f/3.5-4.5 or 5.6 zoom, performance is impressive.

 - The 3-inch 921,000-dot LCD. The D80's LCD is quite good... until you've spent a couple of days with the D7000. If you're upgrading from the D70/s to the D7000, it's like an entirely new world. Though it's not an articulating LCD like the one on the Canon 60D, the LCD on the D7000 is still completely fantastic. Super-sharp, bright, and responsive.

 - U1 and U2 user-defined settings. Wow, I love this! I wish there were 3 or 4 settings, but having even two memories for entire banks of complex camera settings is great. The preloaded ""scene"" settings are also on an entirely different level from the D80 (you set ""Scene"" on the left dial, press ""info,"" then use the command dial to choose from tons of scene options on the main LCD), if you care to use Nikon's predefined scene algorithms. I used a couple (sunset, food) to test them out and the results were quite good.

 - 1080p movies and Live View. I don't envision using the D7000 to shoot a lot of movies, but even having that capability is an obvious benefit over the D80.

 - User-defined menu creation. You can put your most-used menu commands into a separate menu for your personal use and easy, single menu-level access. I really like this feature.

 - Seems to handle off-brand lenses better. Three of my lenses are Nikkors, but two are Tamrons. On my 18-250mm Tamron, the D80 would routinely struggle with it, either taking some time to autofocus or ""losing"" the lens altogether. The display would simply read ""F --"" as if there were no lens attached. I'd either have to remove and reattach the lens or switch the camera off and back on. This has never happened with the D7000.

 - The ""info"" button that puts all of the information that's on the top LCD screen, and a lot more, on the big, color rear LCD screen. I realize numerous newer Nikons do this, but the D80 didn't, so this is a quantum leap for me.

 - The integrated sensor cleaner. I presume it's ultrasonic and just vibrates any errant dust particles off the sensor. You can set this to occur every time the camera is switched on, or activate it on demand. My D80 had no such feature.

 - More megapixels. You'll notice this is last on the list because it doesn't really make that big a difference. The resolution of the D80 was amply sufficient and I still get awesome shots on my 7.2-MP point and shoot Casio EX-Z750, which I continue to love. But 16.2 MP allows for easy cropping with no real loss of useful resolution, so it's definitely a big step up from the 10.1 MP of the D80.",12-14-2010,12-14-2010

From my earlier D70, I already had a few other lenses and wireless remote

First reactions after about a few hundred photos experimenting with the body:

1. Great photos, scene settings work well
2. Active D lighting indeed makes a difference to the overall picture
3. Even at high ISO, noise level is low
4. Well balanced body, though with the 18-200 requires a firm grip
5. Battery life better than expected

Not so good ? only that the user interface for scene settings is a pain, that requires looking at the back screen to see which mode is selected. From the earlier models, where it was quicker

Overall happy with my selection of the body as well as the lenses. If you are in the market for a good DSLR and willing to spend $ 1500-2000 for good lenses and body, this is the best choice.

1. No PC/Sync Socket. If you shoot plugged into strobes you'll need to dust off your D100's old SafeSync or buy another Pocket Wizard.

2. No CF cards. You'll need to buy SD cards which may be a drag if you already have 157 gigs of CF. And remember: These files are bigger. They chew through cards faster. Use ""class 10"" for HD video.

3. Bizarre menu change: Rotate Tall only works in playback. If you shoot portrait orientation via video or HDMI, you're outta luck. Your stuff going to show up sideways which art directors really love. But if you bring your entire production to a screeching halt, you can play them back properly. Absolutely, frustratingly senseless.

Instead, here's some things that the camera does that you might not have heard about:

* Built-in EyeFi support

If you've used EyeFi SD cards before, you probably assumed that it would work with the D7000, since the D7000 now uses SD cards instead of CF. But not only do you not have to mess around with SD-to-CF adapters, the camera is actually EyeFi aware-- you can choose to have it upload or not upload on a slot-by-slot basis (so you might have it automatically upload the RAW files you saved to an EyeFi Pro card in slot 1, but not bother to upload the JPEGs you saved to the EyeFi Explorer card in slot 2), and there is also an icon that appears on the Info display to indicate that there are files waiting to upload, that the upload is in progress or disabled, etc.

The Nikon Wifi adapter is going for $400. A 4GB, class 6 EyeFi card goes for $40. If you really want to move RAW files, snag the Pro version for $80. Yes, the Nikon adapter does things that EyeFi can't, but if you just want to get your files onto a PC without pulling the card, why spend 10X the money?

You're stuck with the usual limitations of the EyeFi card, but I fully expect to use this feature a LOT with studio portraits-- yeah, it only takes 10 seconds to pull the card and have Windows recognize that you added it, then another 5 seconds to eject the card and stick it back in the camera. But if you just want a quick check that your exposure or focus is where you want it, wouldn't you rather just hit a single key and see your last shot, then get right back into the flow? You may want to drop your JPEG file sizes to speed up the transfer.

* In-camera RAW file processing

The camera contains a ton of built-in settings-- in addition to the basics like Standard, Normal, Landscape, etc, you also get all the various Scene modes, which are basically variations on those main settings.

RAW processing allows you to see how the shot would have looked had you used one of those other modes. In other words, you shoot in Normal, which basically applies no processing to the image, then select the RAW file, and choose how you'd like to adjust it. You can change the white balance settings, exposure, basic picture setting (landscape, portrait, etc), noise reduction, color space, and dynamic lighting. With the exception of the advanced details on the basic picture settings, you see a preview of how your change will affect the picture.

If you like it, just hit EXEcute and it writes out a JPEG to your card. Don't like it, just back out and nothing's saved.

This means that you don't have to worry that shooting in Vivid is going to result in an oversaturated image, or you can punch something up even more after the fact. The only real drawback here to me is that it is going to kick out a JPEG, so if you're planning on doing further editing in Photoshop, this may not be the best route. But if you're just looking to go right from the camera to the web, or want to get an idea of how playing with custom settings will affect your shots, this is a massive shortcut to taking and then deleting a ton of shots. (And keep in mind that Photoshop will allow you to mess with most of these settings when importing RAW files anyway, and the plugin D7000-compatible RAW plugin had a release candidate posted yesterday, so you can finally open your RAW shots.)

And a related feature that's in most other Nikons, but that you might not know about-- you can define your own basic picture settings. Want something that's super-saturated and super-contrasty? Just hit a few buttons, choose a name, and you're done. On the older Nikons, you had to edit the basic profile itself, now, you can use one as a starting point and adjust from there. Much cleaner.

* User-defined settings on the control knob

Not as hidden as the first two, but I can't emphasize how cool this feature is. Here's the situation I was in last night-- I was shooting a singing contest in a dimly-lit venue. I was allowed to use a flash, but I didn't want to constantly be blasting the singers while they were performing.

I defined one setting as shutter priority, 1/60th, ISO Hi 2, center-weighted metering & focus, no flash. The second setting was automatic, ISO auto, full metering and autofocus, flash enabled. I'd take a couple shots in U2 with the flash, close the flash down and switch to U1 and shoot a half a dozen shots, then switch back to U2 and use the flash for a couple more shots. There was no fumbling for controls, no worrying that I changed the shutter speed without realizing it when changing between Auto and S-- every time I went from U2 to U1, all my settings were reset to where I put them before the event started.

I don't think I ever felt as confident about my camera settings in a rapidly changing situation as I did last night-- with just a simple twist of a knob, I was able to change to a completely different shooting configuration with absolute confidence that it was what I wanted.

To me, the utility of this is almost endless-- I'll probably set up one setting for studio portraits, and the other for landscape stuff. If I was still shooting news, I'd probably be swapping between flash and no-flash configurations. For sports, I'd change between action modes and post-game portraits.

The only thing that would make this even better would be if I could import and export settings for later use-- even if you use the ""Save/Load"" settings option to back up your current configuration to a memory card, it doesn't appear that this information is stored. However, it may be a bug in the Load settings feature, as a number of my settings were incorrectly reset when I tried to load in settings. Either way, it would work better if I could treat these like custom basic picture settings, saving them by name and loading them at will.

* Built-in interval timer shooting

Want to take time-lapse pictures? Just set up your camera on the tripod, specify when you want it to start, how many pictures to take overall, and how many pictures to take each interval and walk away. When it's time to start taking pictures, the camera will automatically focus and shoot, then go back to waiting for the next shot. No messing around with tethering, 3rd party software, whatever-- it's all in the camera, and it's all super-easy to set up. You'll find yourself taking pictures of your living room just to see what your cat actually does all day while you're at work.

* Zoom in live view

This might just be ""new to me,"" but I found it to be very cool for manually adjusting focus when on a tripod-- frame your basic shot, then change to live view. From there, zoom in with the magnifying glass key, and move around the image with the navigation pad until you find the point you want to focus on, then manually focus. Since you can zoom into a tiny portion of the overall image, you can see that you're getting exactly the focus point you want before you take the shot. One gotcha that I always forget, though-- don't forget to pick your aperture BEFORE going into live view, as you can't change it once live view has started.

* Adjustable shooting rate

Again, might be ""new to me,"" but in addition to blasting away at 6fps, you can manually adjust that from 1 to 5 FPS in order to get a different effect. You obviously need to be using a fast enough shutter speed to support your choice-- if you're at 1/2 a second, you're not going to shoot faster than 2FPS.

As I mentioned in one of my other reviews, I used to be a semi-pro photographer-- I was the photo editor for both a weekly and a daily paper, I've shot tons of sports and news photos, and landscape photography is my hobby. I've recently gotten back into portrait photography as well. While I never owned as many cameras as a true pro would have (that semi- means that I never made enough money at it to be able to really spring for equipment), I have shot with a lot of other people's equipment, and I can honestly say that this is the best camera I've ever used.",10-26-2010,10-26-2010

I paid $1299.99 for the D70 and 18-70 kit lens.  I loved the D70 - it was good enough that I could resist the D80, D200, etc.  I spent my money on lenses instead.  Then along came the D7000.  I was nervous about jumping before DP Review has given their full report, but trusted Nikon and couldn't resist the specs.  Well, after several hundred shots I'm resting easy: this is an absolutely fantastic camera.

If you're like me coming from the D70, the D7000 is a step forward by every objective and subjective measure.  I'm especially pleased with the D7000's new sensor.  Two and half times the resolution changed the way I frame shots.  I can pull back a bit during sports shooting to leave room for alignment corrections that eat up pixels at the edges.  Unlike the D70, ISO 1600 is quite usable and ISO 3200 viable.  I'm actually using Auto-ISO now, a feature I switched off in the D70 since I couldn't stand the noise.

The back panel display is also a sight to behold.  With 7 times the resolution of the D70, the display is beautiful, bright and good enough to weed out poor shots on site.

The D7000 ergonomics felt immediately comfortable to my Nikon fingers.  The only thing that made me pause was to locate the trash can button, which is now upper left rather than bottom right.

Of course, many other pleasant surprises await, a customizable button, live view, Active D-Lighting, not to mention 1080P video.

So, to those still snapping away with their D70's, this is the one!  Enjoy!!!

-- EDIT --
If you are interested in the various GPS adapters for location tagging, be aware the D7000 uses a USB style connector for GPS units.  This is different and incompatible with most other Nikon DSLRs.  Make sure your GPS specifically states D7000 in it's compatibility list.",10-25-2010,10-25-2010

2. weather sealing similar to the D300
3. AMAZING ISO range (100-6400) and lack of noise in low light
4. FAST burst speeds, up to 6 fps
5. 12&14 bit selectable RAW files
6. twin SD card slots
7. ergonomics identical to D90

Cons: 1. still unable to shoot 1080p video at 30 fps
2. RAW files not yet recognized by 3rd party software at time of this writing
3. still not weight balanced when using larger telephoto zoom lens
4. difficult to think of any real cons

Summary: Being a Nikon D90 user for the last year, I love the combination of ease of use, shooting power and image quality. However over time I quickly grew to learn and appreciate the performance limits (fps shooting, ISO range, 12 bit RAW files only) that are addressed by the more expensive and professional level D300.

Imagine to my shock when Nikon announced several months ago a successor to the D90, initially dubbed the D95 then finalized as the D7000. When the spec sheets were announced, my jaw dropped. Basically what we have is a camera that is priced between the pro-am D90 and pro D300 DX crop sensor cameras. While the D7000 clearly and unsurprisingly outclasses the very competent and capable D90 in nearly every respect, from image quality, shooting performance and video capabilities, whats more shocking is how it seems to match or even exceed the specs of the D300s (if you're taking video shooting capabilities into account).

I was lucky to pick up a preorder of the 18-105mm kit from a local store (body only was not available yet at the time of this writing) and with excitement I set about opening it up. Packaged very similar to the D90, the camera comes with the 18-105mm VR kit lens in a separate box and instruction manuals/software CD. A nice change is the battery charger which comes with the usual long cable, but also has a short outlet plug that allows the charger to mount directly to the wall, much like most compact P&S camera battery chargers.

Onto the camera itself. As I've mentioned before, users of the Nikon D90 should find this new camera very easy to use, as nearly all the buttons, menus and controls are identical. They changed the live view button to a spring loaded switch similar to the D3100 with a button that is used to start/stop video recording. I tested the video at 1080p/24 fps and like the previews state, it does continuous AF during the recording unlike previous Nikon HD video dSLRs, however with the built in mic, the AF is LOUD and you can hear it whirring constantly in the video playback. If you want to shoot some serious video you're better off getting the optional external stereo mic that fits in the hotshoe.

Now onto the camera shooting itself. Having the 100% viewfinder coverage is nice, since the 96% coverage on the D90 made for some errors in composition, allowing objects to creep into the edges of my previous shots that I couldn't see due to the incomplete coverage.

The new 39 point AF with 11 cross type AF points is amazingly fast, and you can set to single AF so it only does it once before you shoot, or continuous AF so it'll continue to seek out AF points while the shutter is half pressed.

Shooting speed is FAST on this camera, at a respectable 6 fps at max speed, although you'll need at least a class 10 SD card to acheive this, and it maybe slightly slowed choosing 14 over 12 bit NEF RAW files. Speaking of which, like the D300, 700 and D3, you can shoot 14 bit RAW files now where the D90 and lower end cameras allowed you to only shoot 12 bit RAW which made for inferior picture quality in the final images.

The dual SD card slots are a great feature and the camera gives you multiple options how you want to use these cards, I chose to set mine up as overflow, altho when I start to shoot video I may set up the 2nd card as video only instead.

Now my favorite aspect of this camera, is not, contrary to some, the increased 16.2 MP over the 12.6 MP of the D90/300 image sensor, but the amazing ISO range and low light sensitivity. The D90 had a range of 200-3200 but images became pretty unusable above 2400 without serious software PP NR. I did some nighttime and indoor low light test shooting of the D7000 with its 100-6400 range and found images that looks better at 4000 than the D90 did at 2000 ISO. At 5000 or above, the noise does start to become noticable, but this new sensor plus a good image stabilized lens makes for a powerful low light shooter in most situations. I've read subject user reviews from people who own the D300 and FX sensor D700 and say this camera gives the D300 serious pause and in fact, can compare image quality to the D700.

Something to think about.

Overall this is a fantastic camera for the price and probably the last DX sensor camera I will need for a long time.",10-25-2010,10-25-2010

I have only taken a couple hundred shots but what I have seen after comparing the 90 to the 7000 is the image quality is definitely better and it seems that not only is there a better sensor and processor but also because the camera settings can be adjusted easier and more accurately. For example, the auto white balance is much more accurate and the shutter speed up to 1/8000 along with the great high ISO abilities and the metering seems much more accurate as well. Auto focus is great but I had no complaints with the d90s auto focus.  The controls and the feel of the camera are pretty similar with the 7000 being a little heavier but for the most part the menus and buttons are also very similar with the 7000 being a little easier to adjust with a few nicely placed camera buttons added on. The tripod base plate from my D90 will not properly fit the 7000 but the 7000 and 90 are real close in size other then that. I have no doubt this cameras capabilities are much more than my skill and/or knowledge warrant at this time but I don't see that being a problem. I believe anyone upgrading from a previous Nikon model will absolutely love this camera. I have not had any issues with Video noise or hot pixels. The video that I played around with is excellent quality. I had it on Pre-Order from Amazon but found Calumet photo had it available for the same price so I got it next day air from them.

After a few more days playing with this camera and comparing the D90 and this 7000 the 7000 is so much better than I first realized. Especially the high ISO capability and white balance. Great Camera!",10-23-2010,10-23-2010

The shutter went out a few weeks back but I had been planning to upgrade to the D7000 anyway so this just hurried things up.  I bought the D7000 kit with the 18-105 lens but quickly sold that on Ebay.  I was shooting with a Tamron 17-50 2.8 lens on the D80.  For low light, it worked pretty well but greater than half the time I needed to use my SB-600 flash to capture my young kids doing what they do (move).  The only downside to the Tamron, or combination of the Tamron with the D80, was that the images tended to be soft, especially when opened up.  So I also upgraded my lens to the Nikkor 16-85.  While this is a variable lens that maxes out at 3.5, it is amazingly sharp combined with the D7000.  And the extra reach is great for getting better shots and also providing relatively shallow depth of field that otherwise would be lost with the slower aperture.

The reason I mention the lens change is that I wouldn't have gone to a variable lens had it not been for the amazing ISO performance on the D7000.  I am now shooting flashless at very fast shutter speeds.  I usually shoot raw and process with Lightroom and I'm seeing amazing results at 800 ISO even when fully blown up (1:1).  At ISO 1600, I can see minor noise but Lightroom 3's noise reduction easily eliminates it. 3200 certainly isn't noiseless but again, Lightroom can clean it up very well in most situations.  My old D80 had more noise at 400 than the D7000 has at 1600; I'd say 800 on it was equivalent to 3200 on the D7000.  I could see printing 1600 shots at smaller sizes with no need for software cleanup.  So while my results are preliminary (3 weeks in), I am astonished at the ISO capabilities of this camera.  I no longer have d700 envy and am glad I can get great dx lenses for under $700 as opposed to $1500 for fx.  Perfect for enthusiasts like me!

You've seen the stat that the D7000 can shoot 6 shots per second.  The 6FPS shutter is in some ways overkill.  But if you shoot HDR/Bracket shots in quick succession having such a rapid shutter can allow you to do so handheld in a pinch. This is really only possible because of the high ISO capabilities enabling very fast shutter times. And for sporting events and the like, it's nice to have the ability to rapidly fire off shots.

I have also noticed considerably improved metering and white balance on the D7000 compared to my old D80.  Of the 350 or so shots I've taken, I am spending much less time adjusting lighting and white balance in Lightroom.

As others have mentioned, the ergonomics/design of the camera are quite good and I really enjoy the many direct access shortcuts for adjusting everything from focus to flash to white balance and much more.  The two custom settings are very easy to set and perfect for your two most common profiles (e.g. indoor portrait and outdoor landscape).  The screen is beautiful and moving in and around even RAW files is very smooth and fast.  I went with two 16GB SD class 10 Transcend cards and while I'm currently using the RAW 1 / JPEG 2 option, I plan to use the second as a backup card once I go to RAW only.

I've only toyed with the video function but that was a part of my consideration since I dislike carrying two cameras, plus chargers and media, on family vacations.  The tests I've done in 1080P have been very impressive, albeit large as you would expect.  Auto-focusing while video recording is okay, as long as the background isn't too noisy or subjects too many.  The biggest downside I have experienced is the built-in microphone picks up lots of auto focusing noise.  I have not yet invested in an external mic but probably will need to.

All in all I am very pleased with the D7000 and see no major shortcomings.  It's not cheap, but you get a lot for your money if you are in the market for a prosumer class DSLR.  For users who won't explore and use  the MANY options and capabilities of this camera, I would recommend considering the 3100/5100.  For D80/90 users who are ready to step up big time in terms of performance, this is the upgrade you have been waiting for.  Some will hold out for a D700 successor (D800 or whatever it ends up being called).  I have no doubt it will be an amazing camera but cost wise, you're going to be looking at $2500+ for the body alone and pay roughly double for coverage equivalent lenses.  So figure $4K just to get started.  Too rich for my non-professional needs but certainly should be considered if your work or wants dictate that level of camera.  And there maybe be a D300s replacement in the works too.  Still, I'd urge anyone to consider the D7000, which in my opinion is the best cropped sensor DSLR to date.",10-21-2010,10-21-2010

It's that good.
Handling

This camera is brilliant to hold and use. Nikon has done it again and has made the user interface more usable and streamlined. What to change flash modes. Press the flash pop-up button and rotate the control wheel. Sweet. Want to change create and use a User defined mode? There are two. Set your mode up. Go to the menu and save it. To use it rotate the shooting mode dial to U1 or U2. Presto you are there. In the D300 and D700 you to have to setup things in the menu and switch in the menu. Also, there were 2 sets of things you could change and they were not all inclusive. It was all horribly confusing and I never used it. Speaking of shooting modes. There is now one position on the shooting mode dial for scene mode shooting. You change through the different scene modes with the control wheel and the type scene shows up on the back screen. Sweet. I can go on and on but needless to say Nikon have really improved their interface. One caveat, I don't think it is quite up to par with the GH1 to change exposure compensation (IMO the most important control) but still a huge step in the correct direction in handling. I like the handling of the  D7000 better than either the D700/300.

Low Light Shooting

The D300 wasn't that great for Hi ISO. It shoots clean at 400 ISO and usable up to 1600. (The D90 and D300s were better) The D700 was fantastic. Clean at 1600 ISO and usable up to 6400. It opened up new worlds. The D7000 is close to the equal of the D700. Enough said. Just to give you an example. The bouquet toss at a reception is often done in poor light. By using 1600 instead of 400 you get the equivalent of 4 times more light. At ISO400 you flash may need to use 1/4 power and you can get 1 maybe 2 shots of the toss and catch before the flash needs to recharge. At ISO1600 your flash would only need to use 1/16th power and now you can get 5-6 shots. This is huge.

Picture Quality

Like all modern DSLRs it takes great pictures. I don't pixel peep so I can't really say that I notice a difference between the pictures from the D7000 and any of my 12mp cameras. It makes really nice pictures and that is all I care about.

Useful Photography Features (Not Marketing Features)

--100% view finder! Big bright with 100% coverage. No more guessing of your framing. (It is not as bright as the D700. However, it is 100% vice 95%)
--2 SD slots - When your getting paid to shoot a wedding or any gig, my card broke is not an excuse. Very useful feature. For the home user put two smaller cards rather than one big card and save some money.
--Smaller and lighter than D300, D700, D3s, D3x- When you stand on your feet for 9 hours shooting the wedding and reception, you start to feel every ounce you are carrying. Often you will be carrying two bodies with a fast tele zoom and fast wide zoom. That starts to get heavy. Light weight here we come.
--2016-Segment RGB Meter- for spot on exposure and white balance--No one touches Nikon on this and this one is fantastic.
--1/8000th -- Very useful for shooting into the sun wide open with a bright lens
--1/250 -- Could be better (1/500th for D40) but could be much worse. Auto FP helps.
--Magnesium body and better sealing -- Shoot in dusty environments without messing up the inside your camera.
--Uses the ML-L3 infra red remote -- Small and cheap. IR sensor on the front and back of the camera.
--Autofocus focus motor for non-AF-S lenses

Marketing Features that will sometimes be Useful

--16Mp -- Nikon was obviously getting creamed in the marketing wars on this. This is going to lead to bigger files requiring larger hard drives and faster computers. Occasionally it will be useful if you can't frame as close as you would like and you need to crop or you need to print big. Alien Skin Blow Up 2, Image Resizing Plug-in Software for Photoshop, Macintosh & Windows and Genuine Fractals 6 Professional Edition 1-user Full are two very nice programs that can increase the size of your photos for printing large. 16 MP is nice by not necessary.
--39 Point Auto Focus -- To me in some ways this is better than the 51 point of the D300 and D700 as that gets too unwieldy. However, you really don't even need 39. However, still useful on occasion.
--6 frames per second-- I very rarely ever put my camera in 3 frames per second. When I do so it fills the card quickly. If you are shooting the big game then 6 is nice. Or it is nice for some cool special effects shots. Other than that you won't really find yourself using it that much.

Video
The other thing I am not really going to dwell on is the video capabilities. In my opinion all the various video options are mostly marketing hype really targeted at a niche market. Shallow depth of field video is difficult and time consuming to shoot and edit properly. The average family home user has neither the time nor inclination to do this. With that said, it is nice to only have to carry one device to take still pictures and video. So I do enjoy that feature, however 1080 is not really necessary. In fact with up converting DVD players standard def is still very usable and takes up far less space. Suffice it to say that the video capabilities are very good and should do anything a home user would need it to do. Can be used for pro Videos as demonstrated by Chase Jarvis.

Intangibles

This is a very nice camera and it feels very solid in your hands. It feels far more substantial than the D40/D90 without feeling like a brick the way the D300/D700 do. I am sure the D300 has more marketing features than the D7000 but I would have to research them to figure out what they are.

Conclusion

In the end it all comes down to what is important to you. Smaller weight and size is becoming much more important to me and this camera is a very good trade off of features for size and weight. Anything that is missing I don't even use so I am not sure what it may be. My D700 was recently stolen and while I miss it, the D7000 is a worthy replacement for it. I opted to get the D7000 and Panasonic GH2 and save the $300 difference for a lens.

Pros

--100% view finder!
--6 fps (7D is 8. However, I think this number is overhyped in most cases. Even shooting at 3 FPS will fill up you card with photos that look remarkably similar) 8+ is needed for professionals shooting professional sports. Not enthusiast shooting High School etc.
--16mp sensor (a marketing increase but still nice to allow some room for cropping)
--14 bit photos
--39 point auto focus sensors (19 cross point) this is a bit of a marketing thing but it is still nice and it does not matter about the 51 on D300s and above. Still very nice.
--2016 scene meter - compares against data base for WB setting and color settings
--Excellent battery life
--MD-11 Optional Battery Grip
--2 SD card slots for back up redundancy or double the card space! Outstanding
--Magnesium used to make camera stronger

Cons
--16mp senor (takes up more storage on your hard drive) (12mp JPG 3mb 12 mp RAW = 12 mb 16mp JPEG = 5 mb 16 mp RAW = 16 mb. This is for 12 bit. 14 bit would require more)
--Camera heavier than it used to be
--No swivel screen - after using the GH1 extensively you really miss this when shooting at weird angles. You especially miss it for macro photography.
--No full time live view - Ditto from above. Live view is what you see is what you get. Forgot to change white balance-- you will see that when people are yellow, blue or green. Have it set in manual and blowing everything out-- you'll see that as a white screen.

Decision Matrix

Nikon
For the Nikon shooter this is a no brainer. If you are in the market for a camera, then skip the D300s. The D700 is getting long in the tooth and many people are buying the D7000 while waiting for D800. If you already own a D700 then this camera is a very good complement to it. Use the money you saved over the more expensive camera to buy a nice lens.

Here is a breakdown vs other Nikon DSLRs

D3100-- Two completely different classes with the D7000 being worth the difference in many. However at the end of the day they will both make nice pictures. Also, the lenses are more important than the camera. You can get the D3100 and 18-200mm for the same price. Something to think about.
D5000-- Good sensor and nice camera. D3100 comments also apply here.
D90--Tough choice. The best DX sensor of its generation and still better than most. If you can't quite stretch to the D7000, this is a very tempting proposition.
D300S-- Irrelevant.  The D7000 has a much better sensor, is smaller, lighter, cheaper, and better metering.
Nikon D700-- Would be a good complement to the D7000. Use D7000 when you need the 1.5x crop on the long end and a deeper depth of field due to the smaller chip (about 1 stop deeper) and D700 for when you want to isolate a subject with a shallow depth of field or you want to use the full width of a wide angle such as the 14-24mm. If you don't need the shallower depth of field of a FX sensor and you have the lenses to cover the 1.5x crop then the D7000 should suit just fine. D3s and D3x -- Different leagues altogether. However, the D7000 is 90% of the camera for 1/4 to 1/6th the money.

Canon

The 7D is an outstanding camera and while I think the D7000 is a better camera (better sensor, 2 SD card slots, 2016 RGB metering, Price) it is not that much better to warrant switching if you are already invested in lenses.

Sony

The Sony SLT-A55 is a great camera but not in the league of the D7000. However it is $350 less and does have so unique properties.  It is rumored to have the same sensor as the D7000 but Nikon always does their magic and makes it better (D3x vs A900).  The translucent mirror allows for fast shooting but loses 1/3 a stop of light.  Still a very nice camera.

Non-DSLR Owner or DSLR owner with just the Kit Lens

When you are buying a DSLR, you are really buying into the lens system.  So factor that into you decision making matrix.  For that reason, if you have not spent a fortune on lenses yet then I recommend the m4/3 as in my opinion that is the future.  The sensor of the top m4/3(GH2) is every bit as good if not better than the current crop of DX sensors and almost as good as the D7000.  It is getting to the point, the sensor doesn't matter as much.  At this point handling, size and weight start to become more important.

With this in mind I would recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panasonic-Lumix-DMC-GH2-16-05-MP-Live-MOS-Interchangeable-Lens-Camera-with-3-inch-Free-Angle-Touch-Screen-LCD-and-14-42mm-Hybrid-Lens-Black/dp/B0043VE27Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 16.05 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-inch Free-Angle Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Hybrid Lens (Black)</a>&nbsp;to anyone not invested in a lens system. It is smaller, lighter, more capable on the video side and in many ways better on the stills side. It needs a faster flash sync speed, faster shutter speed and the construction is not up to Nikon or Canon standards (In all fairness this cuts down on weight and I have not had a failure with my GH1.)  It is probably not quite as good at the high ISO. On the positive side it has a multi-aspect sensor as it is actually an 18mp sensor (16:9, 2:3, and 4:3 will all be 16mp not crops of one aspect ratio) It sells for $899 body only, $999 with the 14-42mm and $1499 with the fantastic 14-140mm 10x zoom. The lack of a mirror flipping up is a benefit in all cases. Also, you can use just about any lens ever made on this camera. Nikon, Leica, Canon, Pentax, C Lenses. You lose auto focus on any auto focus lenses and there is no accurate way to adjust your aperture on G series lenses.  While the GH1 sensor was by far the best M4/3 sensor and equaled most DX sensors of its generation, it did not quite stand up to the D90 sensor. I expect the D7000 to have a higher Dynamic Range and be an overall better sensor. However, that difference will not be noticeable to the lay users. What you get is a noticeably smaller and lighter camera that out handles any DSLR on the market and has the best video capabilities. In my opinion the GH2 will be the best all-around camera of its generation. The GH1 is the camera I reach for 90% of the time when I shoot for pleasure. When Panasonic puts out a full Pro line of lenses, I will use it more in the Pro situations. I am sure the GH2 will be my new go to camera.",10-20-2010,10-20-2010

Boy am I glad I did, this camera is amazing.
The image quality is outstanding - it's like they combined Shania Twain and Caroline Wozniaki into the camera - BEAUTIFUL.  I mentioned this to my wife and now she's jealous when I pixel peep at 100% on my photos.  I keep telling her it's simply platonic, but she won't listen.

High ISO performance is very good - I shoot RAW, so I can't comment on JPEG, but I'm sure all the Facebook people who shoot small JPEG will also be impressed.  I'm not sure why they think everyone cares about them sharing every facet of their life through photos, but whatever.

Weather Sealing - This stuff WORKS and thank goodness, because the tears the Canon guys cried once they heard the 60D compared to the D7000 would have completely ruined any lesser camera.
Autofocus performance - It autofocuses so good I don't even really have to lift the camera myself - it just seems to have a life of its own.  Frankly I'd be surprised if one day it just doesn't go out by itself and get some good photos, making me all but obsolete.  Luckily Nikon didn't include arms, so the camera will still need me to extract the photos to my computer.  Opposable thumbs, baby - EAT IT D7000.

Meters with AIS lenses - Finally Nikon got awesome and brought this feature downward.  Of course, a lot of people buying the D7000 won't even know what an AI/AI-S lens is, or why it won't autofocus on their camera, and they surely won't even know what ""metering"" is, but at least Nikon threw the knowledgeable enthusiasts a bone without requiring a DXXX purchase.

In all, this camera is amazing.  It has enhanced my endurance and satisfaction, made me last longer, and has overall improved my confidence.  I'm now firmly committed to Nikon, and I'm sure with this caliber of camera they're going to achieve maximum penetration into the market.

In my case, moving fifteen to twenty feet or so from the sound source causes that Bluetooth chattering. I can't even turn my head away from the sound source without invoking the annoying chatter (choppy, signal interruption) sound.

I had these for a day, returned them and got the Skullcandy Hesh 3, which are great, fit my ears, and have superior sound.

Some reviews on here say the Hesh 2 have great sound, they don't. I think the people who are saying that have never used very good headphones, have only used cheap ear buds, and are impressed to actually hear some bass. But the Hesh 2 has kinda muddy bass and kinda brittle high end compared to the Hesh 3.

Ear cups are round and too small for my ears on the Hesh 2, and my ears aren't huge. Unless you have tiny ears, I think these won't really fit your ears. An hour of wearing these and my ears were hot. Not comfortable.

Plus points: sound OK, cost is OK, and paired effortlessly, unlike many Bluetooth devices. And the headband is solid without hurting. I wish the headband on the 3 were as solid as on the 2.",03-30-2018,03-30-2018

I've been wearing a pair of Skullcandy headphones (PLYR1) for like, 6 years now and they have really held up, but these are just too small for me to recommend.",11-09-2017,11-09-2017

These babies have great sound! Skullcandy are always high quality, and these are no exception They're so lightweight. They charge relatively quickly. The buttons are easy to use and easy to tell apart without looking. Some headphones grip the ears too tightly and cause headaches. These have a springy rubber top piece that has exactly the right pressure to keep them on your head without causing pain. Bonus is, they won't break there, unlike other headphones we've owned.  Even the cord feels pricey. The materials & design are excellent, these feel and sound more expensive than they are. That's always wonderful.

Comparing headphones is tough - the solution? Buy these!","These headphones are fantastic! I was worried that they were a bit pricey, but they are well worth it. After trying several others, including some that were twice as much, I selected these - boy am I glad I did! Why?

The pros:
1. The sound quality is truly superior. The basses are rich and deep, the trebles are crisp and clean, spoken word and music sound fantastic!!!
2. The sound isolation is the best I have encountered without active noise-cancellation. This means you are listening to your audio without interference from the outside world. (There is danger here too, however, don't listen with these in a situation where you need to hear your surroundings!
3. The durability is very impressive -  I dropped these out of my car and partially ran over them. I was very worried that I would have to replace them but, other than some minor scratches, they work just like they did from day one. Very impressive! (I wouldn't recommend others doing this, however, I think I was very lucky - particularly as I had only had them less than a week!)
4. The included soft case (pouch) and the cord for use directly with your audio device when unpowered are definitely superior touches. Both have been very useful!

Cons:
The cons are minor, and they are what make the pros so strong (so I can't give stars for them and then take them away! That said, they need to be pointed out for a fair review:)

1. The noise-isolation can be dangerous in the wrong situation.
2. Their sturdiness makes them pretty heavy! Doesn't bother me, but may not be good for a child or a petite person.
3. They can cause your ears to get hot and sweat - part of the full noise isolation means that there is no air circulation either!

Overall I am very glad I purchased these. I think that they are a great deal at this price-point, and any headphones that would be superior would cost many hundreds of dollars.",08-26-2017,08-26-2017

Sound is loud enough but even at full volume it's not going to leave your ears ringing or anything. Connects fine and for me has stayed connected. Have used it with my Samsung S8 plus and my Asus Zenpad 10 tablet. Can't comment on battery life really cause the longest I have used it in one sitting is like an hour maybe a little more. Don't know how long it will last on a single charge. My only real knock I suppose is the blue flashing light that has been mentioned before. It's definitely bright and easily noticed when using in a dark room. As this is distracting while watching shows I simply just turn them around so each is on the opposite ear and the light now flashes behind me. Other than that I have no complaints.

Original review:
These work pretty well. The sound control on the headphones is nice, as is the rechargeable internal battery. They pair easily with my USB Bluetooth dongle on my PC, and a full charge lasts a while. The audio is pretty good, and the ear foam is comfortable for a while. Like most headphones, though, the ear part and the band over your head get uncomfortable after about an hour or two. It's fine, I move it around a bit and it feels better for a while, but I can't wear them for more than about 4 hours at a time.

EDIT 6/3/18: After much use, I have some more thoughts. This was originally a 4-star review. After about 11 months (right near the time when the warranty was to expire), the battery stopped charging. It became usable only as a wired headset; the wire is included, but I didn't buy these to use wired. I sent for a warranty claim, and they sent me a new set. However, within a month this second set developed exactly the same problem. This is a Quality Control problem, perhaps mixed with a design problem. I would not recommend buying these.",07-22-2017,07-22-2017

I really like these. The sound is good. People are saying it's crap but it's not. I also was thinking it was quiet but I had my windows 10 headphone volume turned down to 45%. The ear pads deafen outside noise fairly good.

Now for cons.

So yes, the ""over ear"" is kind of a joke. Why they don't make these oval shaped is beyond me. Is it cause they wouldn't look ""cool"" enough? Luckily I got tiny ears. The overall comfort is good. Maybe a little tight on the skull. Just a little. I've had way worse.

So I read that these are Bluetooth 2.0. Really, 2004 tech. They have 5.0 out now even though I doubt it's on the market yet. If it's anything like computer hardware, they announce stuff but it takes 5+ years to see it in the product. Like USB 3.1. Anyways, my guess is they're thinking; why change something that works and sells?. I would think they could sell much more if it had newer tech in it. I have a cheap dongle and it's making the headphones cut out when I walk more then 4 feet away from my tower. I'm buying a better transmitter and hope that helps it. Hope.

Those are my only two gripes about these. Thus the big fat star minus. Totally worth the 40 bucks. Anymore then that no.",07-20-2017,07-20-2017

In comparison from what I can tell, the high notes aren't quite as bright sounding and the bass is more pronounced (I'm a big fan of hearing a pronounced kick drum).  I understand the ATH-M50's are supposed to sound very ""natural"" and are preferred by a lot of audio engineers, but for my taste these just sound better to me.

Pros:  I bought these for about $42, which was a great price.  I use these headphones all day at work, and they last the whole shift.  They connect to the bluetooth source very quickly.  They drown out a good deal of noise, and the audio is decent enough for listening to music casually.  These were about as minimalist as you can get in terms of logos and flashy colors, which is best for the workplace.

Cons: They don't actually go over your ear, but instead, sit on top of your ear.  This will eventually make your ears hurt after some time.  I often have to take them off every hour or so and take a break.

They are a nice set of headphones if you don't mind the small size of the ear part.  Honestly, I probably would not buy another set of these in the future if these broke.

The only down side is that they do not cancel outside noise - even when I turn the volume up pretty loud, I can still hear what's going on around me. For the most part, they do block out enough noise that I can focus on what I'm listening to or watching on Netflix - I have major issues with ""competing noise"" (noise coming from multiple sources, such as music playing in my office while I am on a phone call and coworkers are talking around me or the break room - which is directly across the hall from my office - is super noisy at lunchtime) so it's important to me that I be able to tune out most of the noise around me to avoid becoming overwhelmed and anxious. Compared to my other Bluetooth headphones, these are easier for my coworkers to see - this helped solve the issue of people coming in and talking to me when I can't hear them and/or don't know they're there!

Got these to use for tablets and a computer, and wanted the option to hardwire to 3.5mm when desired/needed. Overall, comfort is good. These are ""on ear"" design, unless you have really small ears. They are not noise cancelling, but they do get loud enough to bleed out the surrounding environment - too loud in fact. The highs and mids are perfectly good for this price range - if not better, and the lows are what I would expect - IE, partially existent. These are not $400 headphones, so if you're expecting to get $400 quality sound out of this price range then you will be disappointed. If you are looking for reasonably priced headphones without sacrificing too much quality, wireless and wired option, then these will work great for you. This comes with a soft ""sack like"" case. Wish they would have come with a hard case like the Koss ones I purchased, but there are options here on Amazon.

I'm not really a part of Skullcandy's demographic, I'm a tad past it, but I was in their price point so I was willing to give these cans a go.  Surprisingly they are very nice cans. The bluetooth is rock solid, which is high praise for me. I have other bluetooth buds and cans and they have occasional and persistent issues with connectivity. Not so the Hesh 2. Granted, the use case for the Hesh 2 is an iPad, and watching video at a desk, which means immobile, but even this challenge is too much for other units I own.

The only drawback is that the cans are a bit heavy and they make the ears sweat. I can watch one movie before they have to come off and I have to take a break. Sound quality is good, if not awe-inspiring. The cans are plenty loud, I'll give them that, and they are accurate enough for dialogue.  I've played music through them a few times and it's been a pleasant enough experience, the sound is accurate and well rounded. For the money, it's a very nice set of cans.

Set up is typical for Bluetooth on Apple products, a bit of drama, and then it works. It comes with  supplied cords, one for audio, one for charging. The charge cord is your typical and utterly bland usb micro that is a bit longer than most but not all that functional. Power reserve is 10 hours of active play, which is more than most people could stand considering the wight and pressure of the cans on the ears.

Overall, these are the best bluetooth cans I have purchased, and probably the best at their price point. I highly recommend them for casual users. If you are spending more time with your cans, you are most likely going to have to spend more.",02-21-2017,02-21-2017

This is my third pair of headphones in a month and unfortunately I'm going through a bit of a a goldilocks and the three bears scenario. The Chinese brands I bought were ok and comfortable but they leaked too much sound and the build quality was subpar. I bought these hoping for the winner and aside from how painful they are to wear, I almost got it. The headphones connect seamlessly with any of my bluetooth capable devices (ipad, macbook, android phone, and iPhone). They sound great. I can say they sound great because I'm not an audiophile so I can't hear whatever it is that they hear that makes things bad ;). That being said, after 10 minutes of wearing these, my ears become almost raw to the touch. If I put them on my ears, the ear-pads, which are way too small, crush the top and bottom of my ear against my face. Because of the weight of these, that hurts. To combat that effect, I started tucking my ears into the ear-pad holes. That hurts too. I was promised ""All day Comfort"" and I did not get it. They will be going back.",01-12-2017,01-12-2017

I bought them 7 months ago. I got them because I broke my last ones. I was looking for something durable but with good sound. This guys are really resistant. The head band is made of some sort of flexible material that allows them stretch them to put them on and off comfortably. The soft part is still as new. They are really comfy to wear. It doesn't completely block sound off but it dims a lot of noise down. In my case works perfectly since I need to be able to know if they are calling me or walking down the street without getting run over but still be able to get away to focus. The sound is crispy. It has a low beat. They are easy to connect. The cable works great when the battery is out. The microphone is not that good, it sounds far away so better use the cable one. I normally end up just talking normally on the phone. That was not why I really bought them so I am not taking that off in the stars. The batter y lasts a long time, more than 6 hours of playing.",01-06-2017,01-06-2017

- Mediocre sound quality - even with EQ app on iPhone I couldn't make them sound good
- Not very comfortable - ear holes too small
- Ear cups become hot and sweaty after only about 30 minutes
- Bulky

On the plus side, the Bluetooth pairing worked well and reliably with good range.

There is a lot of hype around these headphones. They didn't meet my expectations
as they sound like cheap headphones. Yes, they are inexpensive, but I expected something better.

Going to stick with my Plantronic Backbeat Fit headphones which are more comfortable and sound better.

I am not going to say they are amazing or can compare with any high end brands, but for under $100 these things are pretty good. They are not great in any one category but middle of the road type of headphones, and for the price they met my expectations.

Sound Quality - These sound decent but nothing amazing. I listen to mostly hard rock/hip hop./blues/alternative and they seem to handle everything fine. I would not say bass is over-pronounced. Overall average sounding which is fine for less than $100 bluetooth headphones

Comfort - these hold up pretty well for a few hours and then start to become more uncomfortable. I think it is because they are an hybrid over the ear on the ear style. The ear holes are too small but the muffs are very soft and form onto the ear nicely. The headhand doesnt have any padding but is a type of rubber/silicone so it does not put much pressure on the top of the head.

Style - I have the black version and i like the way they look. not too flashy and skullycandy log on the side is subtle. I've seen them described as bulbous by other reviewers and id tend to agree. The black looks slick though and i also enjoy the camo style.

Build Quality - Headband is a rubber/silicone coated over the plastic and easy to bend so im not too concerned about it snapping. when adjusting the headband you can see the plastic under the rubber so this could be a weakpoint.

Bluetooth - the connection has been pretty solid and pairs quickly. range is average but i don't go to far from the source with them. i do notice some cutting out when moving into other rooms if there is any obstacles in the between.

Features - i like the simplicity of the buttons on this. there is an overemphasized plus and minus sign for the volume. and the main power button servces as pause/answer call function. skipping tracks is a long press of the volume button. all buttons are on the right ear cup. they are easy to use and work great. charging inside of the ear piece is kind of weird. i have had some issues occasionally with getting the connector into its slot. its not a major issue though. i have not tried the microphone so cannot comment on that. noise isolation is decent because the cups seal pretty good on my ears. probably depends a lot on your size. while you cannot use the ear piece buttons when in wire mode, the clicker button on the wire works simple enough. overall this set has a lot to offer in way of features.

Constant blinking blue light when on - this is the main reason i took off a star. it is just annoying. i wear glasses and can see the blinking reflection sometimes in the glass depending on the lighting. it is also annoying for others around you. i know other bluetooth headphones have this same concept but their lights are usually pin sized. the power button on the hesh 2 wireless is quite large and the whole button lights up. this is obnoxious and the only solution is to put some black tape over it. some could probably ignore this but for me it is annoying.

Final Impressions - overall i like these headphones and thats why i gave them 4 stars. they are mostly average in all areas but are simple and function well. they do a lot of things and this is a strong point for a sub $100 pair of bluetooth headphones. i thought they were comfortable and look appealing. Sound overall is not bad and will probably be good enough for average listener. The constant blinking large blue light is annoying but not a deal breaker. overall a solid headphone for the price.",01-04-2017,01-04-2017

Love the sound quality, but the comfort thing has become a deal break.  Was in BB yesterday and tried on several more expensive models, and the comfort issue was definitely not an issue on these (JBL/Bose/Etc)  ... I'm trying to find an around the ear set now

I really wanted to love these headphones and give them a 5 star rating.  I'm taking off the star for one con --- comfort.  Otherwise I really like these, especially for the price and would recommend them to others.  I really think they represent a pretty good value.

Pros:  Sound is good, pairing was simple and easy, bluetooth range is good and battery life far exceeded expectations!  I use it to make Skype calls as well, and the mic/speaker combo work well.  Noise cancellation/isolation is good enough for me (I can still hear background noise, but it's enough that I can block just about everything out in the house).

Now my one con.... I can't seem to wear these for more than about an hour or two without getting some discomfort.  If the ear openings were a bit wider I think these would work a little better for me.  I will likely use these for some time, but I will likely end up trying to figure out some headphones that don't bug my ears as much on the next go around.",12-27-2016,12-27-2016

But I felt strongly enough about this purchase I decided to write a short review.

I recently upgraded to the iphone 7 and have been looking for a good sounding pair of Bluetooth headphones. While I love my AT M50X and my Sony MDR 7506 (now relegated to my vintage stereo) headphones, I needed a set of wireless.

I read about a million reviews and thought I would take a look at the new Sonys. I decided to head out to the local big box store that carried a variety of headphones.

Well I tried on the Sonys and they were ok, a bit muddled but ok. I was bummed. I then tried (only for so I could say I tried them, the Beats) and they SUCKED! I won't bore you with my opinion on these, but I will say I can't believe people die so much for a mediocre pair of headphones. Marketing does work I guess. But my opinion only matters to me, I get that.

I tried on some other headphones as well to get as wide a sample as I could while I was there. And let me tell you I am glad I did.

So lastly I tried on the Skullcandy Hesh 2 and have to say I really was surprised! I had never heard the Skullcandy brand before, but to my ears, the HEah 2 wireless sounded great. I listened to a variety of music and was really impressed. Good vocals, good bass, and crisp highs. The phone calls I have made sound nice and clear and in fact the people on the other end have had no idea I'm on wireless headphones. I also tried on the Crushers (bought a pair of those too), but that's for another review.

Long story longer, I bought a pair for my wife and another family member. They have been equally impressed.

Now I can't speak to longevity, but they appear to be solidly built and so far are very comfortable. I have had them on for about 90mins and while my ears get a tad warm, it's nothing that bothers me enough to take them off. Battery life has been about as advertised, but I typically charge them every or every other night so I can't swear to the 15 hours exactly. Range has been great within my house, 50+ feet with no issues. I haven't tried them outside, and may not ever do so. I mean who leaves their 800$ phone sitting on a table and walks away from it just to see how far away they can hear Bob Marley without breaking up?

Bottom line, If your looking for a set of affordable, solidly built, nice looking, great sounding wireless headphones, in my humble opinion, you can't go wrong. This is especially true if you can find them used but like new. Give them a test run, you could do a lot worse.",12-24-2016,12-24-2016

They are great for the gym and really anywhere you are traveling that you want to toon out the world and strictly listen to your music. The Bluetooth feature works well, and the sound quality is very good. I have noticed that once the battery gets below about 50%, the Bluetooth connection does get a little fuzzy at times. But the battery life is so good with these that I usually only have to charge them about every two weeks and that's using them 4-5 times per week for about an hour at each duration when I'm at the gym. The comfort level is very good with these too. I can wear these for hours at a time and still be comfortable. They link instantly with my phone and laptop whenever my bluetooth is connected, which is also a plus. All in all, yeah $80-100 is a good amount of money to be spending on headphones but when it comes to these types of electronics, you usually get what you paid for.

It was one of the biggest factors that went into why I got this headset followed by sound quality, comfort, and construction quality. All of those other factors are quite good, and if you're interested in a good set of wireless headphones then you should give these a go. You shouldn't need to deal with the crappy customer service.

lacking bass. -- I don't want something like the Sony Extra Bass nonsense, but I don't want the bassline to be invisible either.

Bluetooth works like a charm, battery life is good, the cable is a nice touch, they look and feel great. Been using them for a month, no problem.

They're not exactly 'Over-Ear' because they do press down on top and bottom of your ears a bit, if you have earlobes. They still are comfortable to wear hours at a time and a quick 3-4 minute break is enough rest to then wear them again for a few hours.

THE ONE CON

These don't swivel right and left, only up and down. For users who don't live alone and want to hear people speak the one-headphone-on-one-off is a bit uncomfortable because they will lean causing more pressure because of the lack of swivel.

I've been using them for about 3 weeks and haven't had any big problems, especially for the price, these are 100% worth the buy. If you are looking for good premium build headphones for a cheaper price. There are probably better 'Over-Ear' headphones that may do the job a little better for comfort.

I was not expecting to like it much more than the V8-1 set I usually use, and in the end maybe I don't, but it has it's points:

It probably is much more rugged than the cheaper headsets, so if you are in a situation where you expect it to take some abuse, that could make a difference.  I occasionally drop it about a foot onto the carpet, so not any particular value to me.

It doesn't creek when you twist it (or your head) around like the V8-1 does.  That can be nice.

The controls are easier to find with your fingers than on the V8-1.

The cushions are really lush.

The microphone is a pinhole type on the right ear, so you won't find it in the picture.  Both flash (this one on the right, the V8-1 on the left, which can be important to your mate if you wear them to bed) and make my head look like a plane coming in for a landing.

The sound on both is fine, hard to say there was any difference there, except the V8-1 seemed to have slightly more bass.

So, is it twice as good as the V8-1?  Not for me, but it depends.  Still, this will be the set that I favor.",09-22-2016,09-22-2016

(10 min out of the box),"Updated Review 2: (37 days later)
I've had these headphones for quite a while and they are nothing short of awesome. I still think the sound could be a tiny bit crispier (like the beats) but the price range for this headset makes it ok.

The battery takes a long time to discharge and I can get one full day out of one charge which is great. My ears do get a bit hot but it's expected if there's warm weather and the cups cover the entire ear. They do hurt the top part of my ear (left mostly) after long periods of time but it's not something too bad.

What did get me annoyed (A LOT) was the lack of volume control when wired and the lack of song control when wireless, so I was trying to find a solution. Just out of curiosity, I plugged my beats cable into this to see if the control would work and it does!! So I purchased a new cable for these headphones (Barely $7):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Replacement-Cable-Wire-for-Beats-By-Dre-Headphones-with-Leather-Pouch/dp/B00NQ8OW7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Replacement Cable/Wire for Beats By Dre Headphones with Leather Pouch</a>&nbsp;for them and it's just what I needed!

There will never be a solution for my wireless problem, but this tiny cable brings new life into a pair of headphones that are already amazing to begin with.

Bottom line: I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again!

Updated Review: (8 hours later)
I've literally had these headphones on for the last 8 hours and I can tell they are very comfy to wear. Haven't charged them at all and they are still holding up strong. Paired them with a Macbook Pro and no issues at all.

Marathoned a tv show on iTunes (4 hrs aprox) and the sound is very good for spoken word. There is no lag between the sound and the video.

Had a 2 hour FaceTime call and the sound quality is great. Testing on my mac I asked the other party to see if there was a degradation of sound by using the built-in mic and the one on the mac and they reported no major differences. Using the mic on the headset on bluetooth does lower the sound quality for the listener considerably. So I would suggest (if you're using a mac), to go to sound preferences and on the input tab, use the built in microphone. It's more reliable.

Leaving my phone on a table, I'd say the bluetooth range is about 20 average steps away from the device and the music is still very clear.

Started jumping, dancing around, spinning and they didn't come off, they fit kind of snug and over my entire ears (which is a good thing for me).

The only thing I didn't notice before my purchase is that there is no play/pause, rw, fw buttons on the headset, only the on/off button, and volume up/down. This isn't necessarily a deal breaker (nor it would demerit a star) but if you're looking for this, they aren't there.

The cable is as long as the one of the Solo HD Beats I had so that's also a plus.

I'll make a third review later during the week to see how they hold up with more use.

Original Review:
Just got these on the mail and I have to admit I'm impressed. Although I have been thoroughly spoiled by the sound my Solo HD Beats have given me for the past 4 years, I wanted to give these a try.
I have owned Skullcandy in-ear headphones before but never these. I have to admit pairing them to an iPhone 6S was very easy and I like the quality of sound (for $70), but I'll still end up splurging on a new pair of Beats wireless, just because the sound on these tends to be a little flat in comparison.
Don't get me wrong, they sound really good, but they don't have the extra oomph I was looking for. The cans are very light and they rest very nicely over my ears. I'll be testing out these headphones and updating my review in the future. So far, 5 stars to them.",07-15-2016,07-15-2016

The battery life is way better and the sound lag on the other headphones while watching TV is way worse.  The skull candy headphone audio syncs pretty much exactly with the video.  The comfort thing is still an issue, but like I said, not if you only have them on for a few hours.  Still great headphones!

I wish I could give these 4.5 stars, but I really had to take some stars off for comfort.  I can only wear these for about 5 hours a day without my ears hurting.  This isn't really a huge deal for me because I rarely wear them for more than a few hours at a time.  Below is my review on the individual aspects of the headphones:

Style:  3 stars.  These things are kind of bulky in comparison to beats or some other more expensive headphones.
Sound;  5 stars.  This things sound awesome!  I really like listening to music with these headphones on.
Quality:  5 stars.  These are high quality, look like they will last forever.  I have had them for 5 months now and had no issues.
Connectivity:  5 stars.  Very easy to pair with all of my BT compatible devices.  Stays connected and has a good range.
Battery Life:  5 stars.  The battery seems like it lasts forever!  I charge these every once in a while just to be sure they don't die on me.  I can listen to them all week for several hours a day without them dying.
Price:  5 stars.  The price is very good for name brand, well built headphones.  I didn't have to worry about paid reviewers reviewing these and making them sound better than they are.  I know several other people that have these headphones.  Sometimes name brand is just a better way to go for warranty and reliability.
Comfort:  3 stars.  They are ok for a little while, but the pads are nowhere near as soft and comfy as my friends Beats headphones.  He let me try them for a while one day and they are way more comfortable.  I am not going to spend and extra $150 to $200 for that comfort when I really don't wear headphones all day anyway.

Bottom line:  I do recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a good BT over the ear headphone for moderate use.  If you can try them on first, I recommend that.  Skullcandy is a reliable and trustworthy name brand and you can't go wrong with these headphones at this price!",06-19-2016,06-19-2016

This particular component is stupidly engineered because it is elastic around the bottom which makes it impossible for me to fit the covering back onto the ear piece as as soon as I get one edge fitted over, just attempting to pull the next edge over, pulls the other one back off again.

I bought these via Prime Now, and apparently they aren't carried by Prime Now and can't find any way of even contacting Amazon or the manufacturer through a Orders history as you can within regular Amazon site.

So I suppose I'll have to manually make contact after attempting to figure out the order history. I'm angry because this is really a stupid and technically minor issue that is causing me huge problems. Nothing even broke, it's just that the ear covering came off, but now the entire thing is useless and I'm stuck wasting time trying to figure out who and how to contact.

PROS:
- comfortable and somewhat adjustable for ours of listening - fit my head and wrapped around my ears well (but if you have a big head/ears, this may be a problem)
- durable - headset band is rubberized material and not cheap/flimsy hard plastic (bend and stretch and no scary cracking sounds)
- decent bass - bass is okay, not good/great, but if you use Android apps VLC or Equalizer and up the volume and bass, you get a pretty good result
- price is reasonable, not like the overpriced popular brands and you can confidently buy versus the no-name brands (that are dirt-cheap or reasonably inexpensive, but the quality is questionable)
- battery life is very good and charge time is very fast
- seconds as ear-muffs during the cold/windy winters
- much better than in-ear or ear-bud headsets at drowning out external noise, but no substitute for noise-cancellation systems
- bluetooth connectivity is good and reliable (audio tips tell you when the headset is connected)
- headset amplifier (via volume buttons) works very well and combined with the volume on your phone, you can get plenty of sounds for most listeners

CONS:
- comfortable ear cushions means they are not dense enough to insulate/isolate exterior noise (screeching noise of the train wheels against the metal rails pierces right through the headset, even when you crank the sound up)
- comfortable on your head, but not when you wear it around your neck temporarily (cannot turn your head down without the big round ear pieces in your way)
- seasonal, i.e. great in the Winter and Fall, but will make you sweat in the Summer (but I guess all over-the-ear headsets will do so)
- no guide that tells you how much charge is left",06-05-2016,06-05-2016

They do not get as loud as normal headphones, but they get loud enough for me and I'm a metal head.

Bluetooth pairing works great. The only issue I have with these is that they do not pair with multiple devices at the same time. For example: When I sit by my computer with my iPhone in my pocket, if I turn the headphones on, they will automatically pair with the iMac, then disconnect and pair with my iPhone, then disconnect from my iPhone and reconnect to the iMac. And this continues to happen and its really annoying. This could so simply be fixed if these would just pair to more then 1 device at a time.

Bottom paragraph is the vedict (summary).

The uproar was fairly painful compared to the Hesh 2. The sound is great and that's nothing new with Skullcandy since they have always given quality sound. Bass isn't too big which isn't a big deal for me since I'm not bass heavy. The button for turning on the device is at a rather not so smart spot. The uproar had better positions when it came to the buttons, MUCH better positions. At least the plus and minus button are at good positions. All in all the sound quality delivers as Skullcandy products have always done.

Wireless is a bonus for me so I don't have to deal with a cable infront of me as I'm writing down notes.

So why the 2 stars? Comfort. I've been studying all day and my head hurts wearing these. And me wearing glasses doesn't affect the comfort because I had them off for 2 hours and no difference. When I take the Hesh 2 off my head feels relieved from the release of pressure. I honestly don't understand why there needs to be so much grip on the head. No the ""Memory foam"" does NOT help at all. Not only that my ears do feel odd with the size of the ear pillows. seriously ear is just large enough to be at the rim. I put the top of my ear in the hole while my ear lobe gets pressure from the pillow. Why couldn't Skullcandy make the hole a little larger is beyond me or even make the headphone a little larger so that it really is around my ear instead on part on ear part off. it's not comfy at all. I don't know what size their ears are but they should take into account the shape of the ear which is more vertical than circular.

This could have been a seriously good product but it isn't . Even with the sound being the high quality that is expected from skullcandy, the comfort just kills it all. Being on halfway and off halfway isn't comfortable not to mention pressure on the head tight cause aches over time. As a college student who spends a lot of time studying while listening to music comfort is a MUST. I've worn these headphones all day today and I'm rather dissapointed. If skullcandy does put out comfortable wireless headphones that are around-ear I'll be there asap to get one and try it but right now there isn't something like that in the market.",04-13-2016,04-13-2016

These are awesome headphones. I'm not a headphone connoisseur by any means, I just got sick of inner ear buds because they hurt my ears. Fit comfortably around the ear, easy to figure out and use. And no cable to mess with! (Unless you wanna attach the mic).

The only negative I have is that I feel like the side of my head is a beacon. Which was confusing on the flight having a light on both sides of my head blinking in my peripheral vision (one side was the airplane's beacon on the wing, the other from the ""on"" button). I'm glad I have long hair so I didn't annoy other passengers (or myself), but when I listen to them in bed or in the dark, I cover the button with electrical tape. Kinda tacky, but the light bothers me.",04-11-2016,04-11-2016

I don't have access to bluetooth Bose headphones, but I do have access to the wired sound reducing Bose headphones.  While we cannot compare apples to apples here, I can tell you that I am CONFIDENT in saying that you can get better sound quality out of these cans versus the Bose equivalents that are around four times the price.

They don't actively cancel noise, but they sound great.

They will not blow you away with fake bass, but rather provide a rich and balanced sound across the spectrum.  I think you will be very happy with this purchase, if you purchase this product.

The range is good, the quality is great, and the sound quality is above what I would have expected for the price - though with the brand I did expect decent sound.  Battery hasn't died on me yet, haven't had them a week, but so far so good!

They SHOULD sound better through their alternate wire-connect. FM radio tops out at 15K also. That's why your CDs (20-20,000 cycles) sound better than your FM.  15K is the 'Brickwall' limit. A friend let me try his Hesh. Not bad!

The fact that these Hesh 2's sound better through the wire is actually a compliment to these phones. It means that the speakers themselves are capable of better frequency response, themselves. The fact that I keep reading these complaints is actually a plus. Knowing that, if you really want to do some Critical listening, plug 'em in & rock out. I'm still reading reviews, but am regular Amazon customer, & retired recording engineer. This is probably the pair I will get.  Also 15K will actually help save you hearing...high frequency hearing can be the first to go. Save yer ears, buy 'em!!!",03-17-2016,03-17-2016

Great.,"**Updated review*** I was dissatisfied with the charging port on these headphones and have  been trying, for two years going on three to find headphones at the same price (or less) with as high quality sound. It has been frustrating as hell. And the Hesh 2 remains clearly the best sounding headphone around the $70 mark. I keep getting suckered by glowing reviews for less expensive products. Leme (incredible for the price with one big flaw... much too quiet) The MPOW (garbage) and the Avantree 40hr audition (great headphones for the price, but they make me miserable because they don't have the hesh 2 quality sound.) I think I'm going to bite the bullet and buy another pair of Hesh 2. Or wait for skull candy to design over  ear headphones with  long battery life. If Avantree can do it for cheap, it can't be long before other manufacturers follow suit.

Below is my old review: It remains accurate. If your bottom line is sound I think you should strongly consider these headphones. And they've moved the charging port to a better spot (and hopefully improved the build on it). I still hate micro usb but everyone seems to use them (love the wireless charging on phones... but that's another review ;).

*******

Pros: excellent sound, 12hr battery life. easy pairing. simple controls.

Minor Con:Minor Con: Big ear cups. The ear cups stick way out, They're actually pretty small in diameter. I'd much prefer larger diameter ear cups that were flatter to the head.

Major Con: This would have been a five star review except for the micro usb charging port.  As consumers we've got to tell tech company's these micro USB ports FAIL and we don't want them on our devices. I'm sick of having frequent-recharge devices such as cell phones and headphones turn into garbage when the ports wear out. And they always seem to wear out.  My headphones are shot because of the port failing. I'm just so sick of this design flaw. And it's everywhere. Boycott devices that use micro ports for recharging. But these are super headphones otherwise. *sigh*",03-13-2016,03-13-2016

Nearly perfect headphones! They are not as big as everyone makes them seem, they're about average size compared to other headphones with similar size drivers. Comfort, the ear-pads are heaven. thats about all you can say about them. some people complain about skullcandy not selling replacement pads, why do you need them? i've owned these for a year and 4 months not, and they have not once fallen off, nor have they ever torn. they look as good as day one the headband stretches as far as you need it to without breaking, however lacks any padding, after several hours of wearing them you start to feel they're on your head, but losen it up some and you'll be fine. Sound quality is unbeatable(like wise with skullcandy products-minus the jibs). music sounds great, and bass is better than any pair of beats. Tested beside a pair of beats solos, these were more comfortable, and very similar in sound quality but these still took the cake. the battery life is outrageous, i believe its advertised as 12 but i get more like 15 with volume turned up quite a bit. volume is plenty to tune out the background noise mowing the lawn. They're just stereo headphones, but they're more like an expensive gaming pair of headphones that you can REALLY tell the difference between left and right. no static noise ever. EVER. not even while messing with the backup cable, which is included(and has an inline mic), and i have used many a time with my ps4. the headset doesn't work with the bluetooth capabilities on the ps4 however because the ps4 doesn't support the profile for the headphones, however i use them while gaming on my pc with bluetooth just fine without sound latency. standard bluetooth range of around 30ft before they start to cut out. some people say they aren't loud enough, lies. they have an independent volume control on them so in order for them to be loud you have to turn up your phone, and the headphones. they have a matte plastic finish which doesn't look cheat at all, and doesn't show off your fingerprints like some glassy plastics do.",03-13-2016,03-13-2016

I have used these many times for multiple hours, and the battery is still over 50%. I am amazed by the battery life! Aside from the issues below, I love these. I spend a lot of time with these headphones on doing homework. Due to the small size of the earpieces these start to hurt m ears a bit after several hours of wearing them. Despite these negatives, they are a very good value.

I was expecting better bass performance with these headphones, given the size of the drivers (50mm). The micro usb plug location on the headset for charging is in one of the worst locations, which makes it difficult to attach the cable without damaging the connector. Additionally, the ear pieces are a little small and barely fit over my ears, I wouldn't say that I have overly large ears, so if you do these might not be the best option for you.

Aside from these issues, these headphones are a dream. The leather ear pads are very soft, and comfortable. The sound quality is very clear. The volume controls are easy to identify, and operate. The styling of these is very nice and appealing.",03-08-2016,03-08-2016

Partially due to a few misunderstandings on my part, and partly due to the headphones themselves.

First off these will NOT play GAME audio on a Playstation 3 system, which was the primary reason I purchased them.
NO ""normal"" Bluetooth headphones will. These will ONLY work for in game chat, which is stupid, since by having both ears covered there is no way I could hear the game to play it.

Secondly, the ear-cups are much larger and looser than I anticipated, meaning that they were both insecure on my head, and at the same time pushed uncomfortably on my glasses.

Thirdly the quality of the sound over Bluetooth, from several devices was low average, lots of cutting out and weird clipping of sounds, also volume was far too low and they had a hard time staying paired with both my computer and my Galaxy S5 smart phone.

Positive notes:
Sound with the supplied 3.5 MM stereo cable attached was more acceptable, but kind of defeats the purpose of having wireless headphones.
They felt fairly sturdy, not like they were going to fall apart.

Music Sound Quality: The Bose are awesome, great base and seperation of instruments, great sonic space. The AudioMax are surprisingly good -- great clarity and it actually makes you not miss the Bose. The Hesh 2 Wireless is a distant 3rd. The music feels flat and a bit compressed. It's OK but if you really like music, the AudioMax sound better.

Video Sound Quality: Again, the Bose are amazing. However, the Hesh 2 are good for watching video on iOS and desktop. The AudioMax actually had a delay in sound, so the lipsync was always off (especially on iPhones and iPads.) The Hesh 2's handle it well and videos are totally watchable, lipsync is robust.

These are NOT over-the-ear headphones. Just to be clear. They are circular, and fairly large openings, but they do NOT fit over my ears completely. I'm not sure if I like this or not yet. The ""ear cushions"" are indeed soft and pillowy. I can't imagine them hurting over long periods of time like some other headphones, but I'll try to come back and update this review when I've used them for a few days.

The tops of my ears fit snuggly inside the openings, but I can still feel the cushions pressing slightly on them. I may be able to adjust them to make that not the case, but the lower part of my ears are definitely not inside the openings, and it feels awkward to not have my ears completely enclosed.

The sound is SLIGHTLY muffled/muted. Lower volumes so far seem slightly muffled, but louder volumes don't seem to be as bad. Granted, I didn't get these to listen to them on low volume. I got them because I want to be able to crank my music up without bothering people in adjacent offices without being tethered by a cord.

They are heavy. From what I can see they would not be good for jogging or biking. But what do I know, I haven't biked or jogged in years.

I'm now on the fourth song, and I'm liking them. Again, slightly muffled, but not bad for bluetooth and $60. It's going to take some getting used to with my ears not quite fitting, but if they don't give me ear fatigue, I think I can deal with that.

I don't think I'll return them, but if I were to purchase fresh right now, knowing what I know, I might look for headphones where my ears fit fully inside. True over-the-ear headphones.

-----

11 songs in: I've forgotten about the awkwardness of my ears, but instead my ears have felt... I don't know how to put it... suffocated? Like, I need to take them off to let my ears breathe a little bit. I haven't, but I feel like they need to a tad. It's a little warm. I might get used to this as well.

-----

5.5 hours of solid listening later, I'm getting a little bit of ear fatigue in my lower right ear, as well as the backs of both ears. It's not as extreme as the last pair of headphones I had been using that were on the ear, but it's still not as long term wearing as I was hoping for.",02-13-2016,02-13-2016

Not real heavy on the bass as the Sony set I had bought. And does not have any ""tingy"" sound to them as other cheaper sets. I am not an audiophile by any means but I rate these very highly. They have an evenly balanced sound.
The Skull Candy has a nice sound while on Bluetooth although they do not get extremely loud, but loud enough to enjoy your music. Plug in the 3.5mm cable and watch out, they can get EXTREMLY loud. I love the wireless option, so I can put up with a little less sound. The controls are easy to adjust while on wireless and it was easy to pair up on Bluetooth. I have had Skull Candy earbuds and they were nice too, except they never seemed to last long. I am hopeful these will be around for years to come.

The only 2 cons I can see at this point. 1. I would have liked them to be able to get louder on Bluetooth. 2. They say over the ear, but they are not quite that big. They are in between over the ear and on the ear. If you have small or medium ears, I think you should be ok, but if you have large ears, forget it. Mine almost cover my ears, it touches the top and bottom of my ears. I should be able to handle this, but I really prefer the true over the ear headphones. But I like these enough I will keep them and use them. If you wear earrings, they may push the studs a little, I could see that getting uncomfortable for an extended period.",02-12-2016,02-12-2016

Stay Away if you like Good Sound and Comfort!,"When I purchase a set of headphones, I am looking for comfort and quality sound.  These headphones fail miserably in both categories.

When I first opened the box and pulled these out out I was impressed, they look really cool and feel durable.  I charged them and when I heard the first song I played I was totally let down.  They sounded as if they were playing behind pillows; very muffled and very drab sounding.  The highs were not clear, the mids were non-existent and the bass plain sucked.

I thought how lame!  Skullcandy is supposed to be a good name in headphones.  Anyway I tried listening to these thinking maybe I could get used to them.  However after about 3 songs, my ears began to hurt because the padding inside was pressing too hard against my ears.  In baseball hats, I wear a size 8 so my head is not big in any way.  These were just plain uncomfortable for anything over 15 minutes or so.

The final straw was when they started cutting out intermittently far too often then they should.

For $70 dollars, these are a total waste of money.  They may look nice, but when you cannot wear them for extended periods of time and the sound is so bad, you don't want to listen to them, they are useless.

Pros:
- The sound is nice and crisp, The bass is not overpowering, and with an equilizer, you can really customize the sound.
- The headband is soft and the ear cups are comfortable.
- They're very easy to use; intuitive.
- The included stereo cable, used to run them when the battery is dead, is short, but works great.
- They've fixed the charging port location. A lot of these reviews say that the charging port is on the top of the ear cup, It's now on the bottom next to the stereo cable jack, so you can wear and charge at the same time.

Cons: (You knew there had to be a few since it's not a 5 star review)
- The ear cups have very little give, so they don't twist to fit the angle of your ears at all. can get a little uncomfortable after a couple hours of use.
- The headband appears to be plastic. I've had 3 other pairs of SkullCandy headphones (Skull Crushers and 2 other pairs of Hesh) with similar headbands, and they've all broken in the past. I bought an extended warranty on these so that when (not if) the ear cup breaks off, I can get it replaced
- (The BIGGEST con so far!!!) The power button is surrounded by lighted LED ring that flashes blue while connected. While this isn't a problem for me (I can't see it when listening to them), it's very distracting to others when you're listening in a dark room or on the bus before the sun comes up. it would be VERY nice if the flashing could be turned off, My wife used them for a while and I kept seeing the flash out of the corner of my eye, and it was really disruptive and annoying. I get it that there needs to be an indicator that it's still connected, but put it somewhere where it doesn't annoy the heck out of other people. I'm now very self conscience about using these on the bus, because I don't want to annoy my fellow commuters.

A good pair of noise-cancelling headphones with a built-in mic for my many conference calls seemed ideal!
Not so much.
As a caveat, I am not an audiophile, and I don't have boatloads of money to spend on audio and computer equipment. This was the most money I've ever spent on a pair of headphones.

The noise cancelling was great, surrounding sound was blocked out completely. And these are quite comfortable, I had no trouble wearing them several hours at a time. The Bluetooth connection was strong and never wavered.

Everything else? Pretty bad. The sound was muffled, like it was trying to saturate the bass too hard, which made everything sort of fuzzy. The mic is complete garbage - I was repeatedly told that my coworkers couldn't hear anything I was saying, despite speaking quite loudly. In other words, the two things I needed this headset to do - play sound and record - it did poorly.",01-14-2016,01-14-2016

Do these headphones go over your entire ear?  Sadly, this is not the case.  If you are insistent on having Skullcandy headphones that cover your entire ear, then your best bet are the Crushers which, as of the typing of this review, are not wireless.

That little issue aside, let's talk about the product.  These headphones are very comfortable to wear and mostly go over your ear.  With the way I wear them, they touch the top of my ear.  Skullcandy claims Hesh 2 headphones have a fifteen hour charge.  I've used these listening to music off and on for a total of eight hours thus far with no issues so I can't say for sure if the fifteen hour claim is accurate.  Music comes through well enough for me.  I'm not an audio snob so if the bass is a little off or the treble is a wee bit high means nothing to me.  I can hear my music and it sounds rich and clear.  They aren't noise cancelling so you can hear some sounds around you.  They are also not consider noise cancelling so if you find that to be a problem, then get noise cancelling headphones.  As for using the headphones for phone calls, they work well enough. Callers can hear my voice clearly and I can hear them well. There is an annoying delay that comes with Bluetooth usage so I opt not to use them for phone calls.

Overall, I love them.  Yet another wonderful product from Skullcandy.",01-07-2016,01-07-2016

People buy them because of the cache and the celebrity endorsements. Beats are garbage, and spending money on them is a huge waste. Yes, these are better than Beats, a lot of headphones are.

Pros:
Super comfortable
Very durable
Onboard controls
Long battery life
Cute design: I like the little skulls on the band

Cons:
Heavy
Very Quiet, even at full blast, I find it insufficient.
No noise cancelation, makes the volume issue worse.
Comes in a giant stupid bag, and doesn't fold, so storing them is a huge pain in the ass.
I've been told on calls that it sounds echoey and the caller can hear themselves on the other end. This has only happened a couple times, and usually when I'm laying down.

So all in all, these seem ideal for gamers who want to sit in a quiet room and have a headset to play games and chat. But for commuters and people who may be going through noisy areas and might want noise cancelation, not so much. They are super comfortable though, I will say that even a second time. They are SUUUUUPER comfortable, haha. And I like the little LED flashes, the colors, the sounds, the style of the headphone is very nice. It's very cute, is very well

These are NOT over the ear unless you're 5 years old.","I picked up these Skullcandy Hesh 2 wireless headphones at a major box store for the same price as Amazon (wanted them today).

The ""Over the Ear"" spec is way off.  Maybe they would be over the ear for my 5 year old...

Pros:
-Easily pairs
-Comes with wired cord for when the battery runs out (or you forget to charge)
-Sounds decent for the price
-Controls Samsung Note 4 and will track forward (Plex music)

Cons:
-More of an ""On ear"" headphone, feel top of ear fatigue in less than 20 mins of use... (Might be returning)
-Not crazy loud... (Which is fine I use these at work)
-Fatigued the top of my ears in under 15 mins...

Overall for under 70 dollars these seem ok, the fit is my only complaint.  Will update as time goes on.

BT and wired produce poor sound quality.,"I tried the wired version in a store.  Evidently, the display had highly processed music because every range came through in a pleasing manner.  When I received these, I tried them.  The Hesh2 paired very easily with my iPad.  After that, it was very less than adequate.  I used a very familiar albumI have been listening to this album, in different formats, for 30 years.  The sound quality was poor, not all ranges were presented accurately and hear-able.  It is a problem to be missing parts of songs and know they should be ""there""  The poor quality sound was on bluethooth and wired connections.
On bluetooth, the music would stutter at times.  It would pick up at the same place as before the stutter.  There were occasions when the music would ""warble""slow down and pick up with some pitch distortion.  The Hesh2 were always within 2 feet of my iPad.

My previous wired headphones have none of these problems: Koss DJ/100& 200.  Being wired, they require a cable.
I returned the Hesh2 and will either try the Koss bluetooth headphones or the Bose over the ear, bluetooth headphones.

Clear, crisp sound especially connected to my Bluetooth headphone amp with 0 distortion even at max. volume. Heavy Bass. Just ok without the extra 60 watts from the amp. The Bose, without or without the amp, blow these off the charts. Got the Bose ""Like New, open box"" here on amazon for 149.00

Got these in a ""Lightning sale"" here on amazon for 54.99.  wall mart (sic) reg. price for these 59.94. I purchased soft velour ON EAR covers for these because the PLEATHER made my ears sweat within 5 minutes. These are 3 1/2 inches so if you get covers get 4 inches, as they slip right over these & if necessary Electrical tape matches all ear covers securing edges anyway, so you can secure them easily with that & no one will ever notice. 3 1/2 did not fit over the pleather, & removing the pleather then putting the covers on didn't work right. Doesn't affect the volume or sound at all.

Frankly, unless you're hitting these with some real power, they are too low in volume for the 50mm Drivers. Plug em in any home theater Receiver & you'll see what I mean-bzzz to THUMP! Even so, the Bose are tiny compared to these but have much fuller sound, handle high power effortlessly, better Bass & if you find a good ""Used"" pair backed by amazon then spend a little more, for A LOT MORE. Crazy tiny MINDBLOWERS those little Bose!

Also, takes a good 5 seconds to power on while holding the stiff power button. Same with turning off. No padding for your head (I made one off older headphones-velcro'd right on) & they are huge for Bluetooth. They do not fold & come with a cloth ""Case"".

You get what you pay for, but these are worth no more than 150.00 (Retail) & that's it. Rated #2 of all Bluetooth headphones, price being the MAIN consideration.",12-02-2015,12-02-2015

I received them as a gift and was really trying not to be critical but I couldn't but share my thoughts.

Pros:
- good battery life, I easily get 3-4 days with moderate usage between charging
- decent build quality excluding the quality of the actual phones
- relatively light

Cons:
- bad to mediocre sound quality for headphones this large. This is really disappointing, especially considering that other companies have models that remain virtually unchanged for 25+ years and have superior sound quality. Take Sony MDR-V6, for example. The sound of Hesh 2 is far removed, lacks details as if you're listening to the music in through the wall or have a bag on your head. Bass is a bit loud which probably makes trending music sound a bit ""better"" or rather not as bad.
- blinking LED light around power button that you can't turn off, at night it becomes very annoying as it's quite bright and reminds me of nothing but of an aircraft with a strobe light on.
- not the best design, a bit bulky - but that is probably a limitation of modern technology when you need to cramp a receiver and a Li-Ion battery into headphones

Verdict:
Mediocre sound quality makes these headphones a bad choice for majority of people. However, if you don't care much about sound quality and want  long-lasting headphones they are not that bad.",11-29-2015,11-29-2015

let's start off with just the box the box is informative and minimalistic but classy the instructions are clearly visible the features are clearly visible some of them aren't exactly accurate to my standard but to the layman they will give you a good understanding of exactly what you're getting
once you open the package they come out looking great you get the headset the cable and instruction booklet and most of the things that you find in a new set of headphones so let's get on to just the headphones their beautiful there very sturdy no clicking in rattling sounds when you shake them they look very quality orientated the skull candy logo is across the top and there is a logo on the right and left sides and the cups are strangely comfortable if you followed my instructions you know that they come with 50 mm speakers it built in microphone and the cable includes a microphone also at first glance I would call it a noise canceling microphone but the instructions say that it can be used as a microphone unto itself there is the large volume buttons a pairing button which also doubles as a power button now I would say that is the biggest points of its physical appearance now once I connected the headphones by cable to my PC it was apparent that the sound quality was great not very busy it has that high fidelity yield to it the microphone worked very well with the cable but like I said on my first impression of these headphones I really believe that the sound was being conveyed to the system from the headphones themselves and the instructions say that it can happen that way but the real reason why I'm getting very clear sound from my voice into the system is that included headphone microphone that is connected to the cable not from the microphone coming from the headphones themselves and again I believed that these were wireless headphones but you've got to remember like I said there's a cable and that is how the sound is being conveyed to the headphones I did get a chance to use them in their wireless capacity that quality of sound is considerably less than the cable connection considerably what I have found out in the last week while not yet a week but in the time that I've had them
at first I really considered returning them because I was not satisfied with the connectivity portion of the headphones but having them now for a week I have reconsidered my conclusion about the connectivity usually I use my headphones at my computer so being connected that way for high fidelity sound is not a bad thing and when I use the headphones with my cell phone it gives me in option I can just plug the included table into my cell phone or go it wirelessly via Bluetooth I can also receive sound from my computer via Bluetooth and also use the microphone via Bluetooth the only thing I have a problem is that in the Bluetooth connectivity side of the equation the quality is greatly decrease I don't even believe that the sound quality coming via Bluetooth is stereo the booklet and the box says that it is but when you listen to the sound you'll be able to tell that it's not really that way the first time you use the cable you will understand what I'm saying but even for a wired set of headphones to give you the fidelity and the response that you get from these you're going to be happy with the results I have used many different types of headphones wired and wirelessly turtle Beach Corsair Logitech and so on they all start off with great construction except for the turtle Beach in my price range they were not constructed very well as well is to a be expected for the price point but they never lasted past one year but like I said for the price it kind of balance itself out but when you spend more than $100 for a pair of headphones you really need to be a little bit more careful only because I don't know how your budget is but I can't afford to buy a new set of headphones every few months they have to last me at least a year to be viable at a certain price point as far as longevity goes I had my Corsair headphones for more than a year closer to two my Logitech's lasted exactly one year turtle Beach I still have two or three of them still working not wirelessly but they are still working and I usually give those headphones to my kids or someone in need at the time and I can always fall back to my wired headphones whenever you're having battery problems we know how that goes but with these headphones if the batteries should go down the wired connection still work with or without battery life which meant that I could keep these headphones in use longer than any of the others so as far as quality and performance I would say that these are pretty good for someone looking to do a little like gaming sometimes just spending time on your cell phone talking to your friends or just listening to music I would say there a good addition to someone who's got maybe two or three other sets of headphones for different applications because you can use these with your cell phone or any other Bluetooth connection that should be available television VCR anything that you have that is Bluetooth connected and the battery life is pretty good it says 15 hours of continuous use but you usually don't sit down for 15 hours so you figure if you sitting in front of the computer to her three hours at a time in a day you've got to three days of battery time there and if you just use a number use your phone it's even more and like I said if you have the wire with you you can use it until the batteries go dead and then just plug the wire in until you get home to charge them up I haven't had that problem yet I hope I won't have that problem but in the case that it might happen I know that I won't be without until etc.",11-16-2015,11-16-2015

The good: They have good sound, paired easily, and seem to have good battery life. They seemed comfortable at first on my ears.
The not so good: I have moderately large ears. After using the headphones for half an hour the outside part of my ears began to hurt - I believe from having been folded into the earpiece. The headphones also began to feel tight on my head and I don't see a way to loosen the pressure on the sides of my head.

It's not as hard as removing the funny bone in the game Operation, but it's not easy either. The USB charging port is on top of the left can but it's covered by the headband. So, to recharge it you have to pivot the left can out and hold the headphones so the port is exposed with one hand and then jack in with the other into a tight space.

I also like the large volume control buttons and the aux cable option. But I have had a few minor issues:

1. The clamp pressure is a little bit on the tight side. This is what allows for the noise isolation. I suppose it wouldn't be an issue for a small headed person, but I have a decent sized head, so it is a little snug for my liking. Also, it can get warm fast if you are using for exercise.

2. The cups are a little small for my larger than average ears, so I have to bend them ever so slightly to fit into the cups. This is not a huge issue for short term listening, but after a while can certainly get annoying.

3. I have had issues with connectivity to my laptop. I use these on both my smart phone and laptop. No issues with smart phone, but lately (after a month) I have had issues connecting to my laptop. Most of my other headphones (I have about 6 other pairs) have no problem connecting so I know the issue is not with the computer. I will update if I find out anything new.

Bluetooth or wire in, the sound is pretty much the same. I say that because I've read reviews that said the Bluetooth sound is lower than the wire in sound. If you buy new ones, thats NOT true.

I also read reviews said said they are heavy and uncomfortable. That will probably depend on your head size. But they are not heavy at all. They don't hurt. Very comfortable. But that's me.

Very easy to connect and battery life is pretty extensive.

And like the guy told me when I bought em, these aren't for exercising or working out in. They are for when your chilling. If you need something for on the go, get the smoking buds 2 wireless. I haven't tried them so I can't tell you what they are like.

I'm listening to yo gotti on these now and I like it lol. As far as noise cancelling, unless you have them turned up, doesn't cancel too much noise. So.. Don't buy these for that.

Overall I recommend these if you want something wireless and ""good enough"" for the time being until you can get something like Bose. That exactly what I'm going to do. But very nice headphones though. And that is real.

Oh yea, the charge port is in a weird place behind the left ear pad. Be gentle when plugging in.

Update..10/30/15.. I finally used these to talk on the phone and the mic picks up great. I could hear the other party clearly and they could hear me clearly.",10-17-2015,10-17-2015

I would say this is an awesome headphone for its price. I got this pair for somewhere around $60 when there is a discount. Regarding this price, the performance is outstanding among its peers.

Pros:

1. Design is simple, function is easily accessible.
2. The volume is neither too loud nor too small. I would say it's very well adjusted. I once had a Jabra Move, but the sound is way too loud. Even the lowest level on that headphone hurts my ears after half an hour. The loudest sound on this pair is very loud. I would never use this loud volume anyway. I am good with around level 3 volume on a noisy bus.
3. Noise isolation is enough, on buses and subways. It cannot block everything, but the noise isolation make the music much better on these noisy environment. In an office environment, it will block others' conversation with music on volume level 2.
4. The sound quality is good in terms of Bluetooth streamed music. Off course it can not offer the same quality as those wired headphones, but the sound is good enough for you to immerse in the music instead of complaining a messed and muffed sound. (Note: I have never test it using corded option. I don't think there is any point to use a bluetooth headphone with cords.)
5. Battery life is awesome. I charge once a week.

Cons:

1. The headphone is kind of hot, it suffocated my ear in one hour of use. It would be better in winter or in AC cooled room in summer. But it is definitely not a wise choice to ware it outside in summer.
2. Can only connect to one device at a time. For some other models, you can get two connections at once and switch between them easily. This model cannot do that.
3. The charging port is at a wired position, making it almost impossible to listen to the music and charge at the same time. Well, I won't do it anyway. And I won't seriously consider this as a downside because it hides the charging port cleverly when you are using it.

Some other things to say about comfortableness:

As some comments point out, the pad is some kind of small. Some users complain that it's uncomfortable because it can only act as an on-ear headphone. The trick is, you have to put your whole upper back position of your ear INTO the pad. It is OK if the lower and front side of your ear get pushed by the pad a little bit if you get a big ear. DO NOT wear it like an on-ear headphone, it is not designed that way. I wear this headphone comfortably for one hour even I have a pair of glasses under the pad. With the Jabra Move I once had, it really gives me a headache after 20 mins of use.

HOWEVER, this pair will not last long on my head. After approximately two hours, I became notice of the uncomfortable felling and have to take it off for 15 mins for a break.",09-04-2015,09-04-2015

I love bass and loud music. These headphones sound great when they are wired, but when on Bluetooth there is a substantial volume deficiency.

I read other reviews about this before purchasing and gave them a try anyway. That was a mistake.

I exchanged these at best buy for Sony's MDR-XB950BT which were on sale for $150 and they completely blow away these Hesh 2's. For an extra $50 I am completely satisfied. The extra bass feature really cranks up the bass. They sell the Sony's on Amazon for $148 at the moment.

If you can afford the extra $50, go with the Sony's. If you can't afford it or if you don't care to have your music loud, the Hesh 2 is an okay alternative. The volume deficiency while connected via Bluetooth was a deal killer for me. There is no deficiency in volume with the Sony's.",09-03-2015,09-03-2015

I own a pair of Parrot Ziks, Wireless Beats, etc. - I got these because I wanted something I could take to work with me and I am seriously beside myself. The sound is not super bass heavy like it's competitors, but it is clean and you can hear a wide range. That said, I tested the bass against my ""go-to"" ( On My Level - Wiz Khalifa, feat. Too $hort ) and they sound great.

Pros:
- Great sound. Can compete with higher priced headphones easily. Right now they're scoring above my Ziks.
- Big ol' buttons... The buttons are huge on the headset. That means you're not fumbling for some tiny thing and accidentally go to the next song, and if you've done that while listening to Pandora you know how infuriating that can be.
- Range is amazing. I left my phone downstairs and was microwaving a pizza when I realized I've been walking around my house with these things still going strong. I can even walk around my garage with the phone in the basement and they're still crisp.
- Comfortable, but secure. You can do things around the house and they won't fall off your head.

Cons:
- I have kind of a giant head and they're a bit tight, this will likely change with repeated use so I'm not super worried. I actually wear them backward ( L on right ear, R on left ear ) as that is more comfy.

Definitely recommended.... if that changes I'll update the review. - on that note, I just bought a second pair. The ones on my head at the moment came from Best Buy.

Songs used for testing:

Some ppl mention that they are a little heavy, I would add that they are a little wide as well from right to left compared to more streamlined models from Bose and Sony. They are wireless though! They actually sound really good on bluetooth and they have a cable just in case your power runs out. Those points themselves are great but I can also add that the battery lasts forever ... so far, I've charged them every week or so just in case I was running low.

I can add that also, even though they are a few ounces heavier than others, for me, they never really feel uncomfortable and I was able to get them for 80 dollars at Bestbuy matching the Amazon Prime price. For a comparable Bluetooth headphone at this price range, it doesn't really exist. Even the Sony ones I mentioned are around 100 dollars but the quality from what I've read isn't as good.

The cups are WAY too small. I didn't think I had big ears but these are starting to make me feel self conscious. They are described to go around the ear but unless I fold my ears into them, they sit on the ear. The clamping force is also way too high. These things will give me a massive headache after a short while. They also don't breathe. Man do they get hot.

Second, the sound. While not terrible, they are FAR from great. They are very bass heavy and it's not clean bass either. Basically they just sound all around kinda muddy. I can get them sounding acceptable on my phone with a lot of EQ tweaking though but all my other headphones just sound better.

And now for the main reason I originally bought them. The Bluetooth functionality is the best part. It connected to my old phone quick (Droid Razr M). The controls worked great. HOWEVER, the signal was not the best. With the phone in my pocket, audio would often stutter. It was kinda random though. It's not as bad on my new phone (OnePlus One) but still happens. It might have something to do with the fact that I think the Bluetooth module is in the right side of the headphones and I keep my phone in my left pocket. Still, if that's the case, I would still expect better performance. If my phone can pair with a 2014 Subaru Forester 30 feet away, then it should be able to work with these headphones 3 feet away.

I originally bought these because the headphone jack on my old Droid Razr M broke. They served their purpose and are officially retired. Since the headphone jack works perfectly fine on my OnePlus One, I'm back to my Sennheiser PX 360's. One positive though. I recently bought some Philips SHP9500 headphones for my PC (which sound great and are supremely comfortable, just no bluetooth and are an open design) and the cord was too long.

Don't believe the good reviews here.,"Have no idea why the reviews here are more than two stars.  This Hesh 2 is not worth the $100.  There are two good things about this headset:

1.  They don't fall off easily like the Sennheiser wireless headphones.
2.  The battery charge life is long

BUT, these two things are not offset by the defects in design:

1.  The sound is muffled, poor, and lacks brilliance.
2.  The buttons for on/off, higher volume, and lower volume and not palpable.  To locate and use them one has to remove the headset to find the + and - buttons, unless one is skilled in braille.
3.  My set was NOT stereo.
4.  They apply a bit too much pressure on the head, but that's improved if one reverses right and left.
5.  No treble/bass adjustment (the company alleges that this feature will be added in the near future)
6.  The signal travels about only 20 feet max.  My other pair is wireless, not bluetooth, and they transmit at least 100 feet.

I would recommend these overall. Good performance, mid-range price.

Pros:
Good balance of sound. Good at noise isolation. Bluetooth works great. Charge lasts a long time.

Cons:
Heavy. Ear cups start to get painful after about 30-45 minutes of use. Charging port is in an awkward position.

The pros outweigh the cons with these. I'm glad I purchased them, but would have liked to have tried out something like the Jabra Move/Revo first. The packaging on these is such that it basically gets destroyed when you open them, making returning pretty much impossible.

The sound has a good balance of treble/mid/bass, not too heavy or lacking in any of them. If I had to make one modification, I'd increase the bass level just a touch for a little more oomph.

I work in Electronics. I've heard many-a headphones. These are one of the best as far as sound quality, bass and freedom I've heard within the price range (up to 199.99). Beating out even Beats by Dre, especially in quality for price. I first thought that they weren't that great, as I used them with my phone, playing Pandora. I felt like they didn't get loud enough for me (I'm amazed I'm not deaf yet after years of loud headphones) or blast enough bass. Then I found an old MP3 player and plugged them in. WOW! I had to turn it down half way! The only headphones I've heard that really beats the bass in these (in the price range) are the Skullcandy Skull Crushers. Definitely worth the buy.

As for working out, it depends on what I'm doing. Anything which involves laying down is a little tricky (bench press, skullcrushers - not related to the headphones lol - as the band can slip off and that is a little awkward when you are holding heavy weights. Anything standing or sitting upright is no problem.
For running, I can deal. They don't slip BUT you're going to feel like your ears are in a sauna. They are going to sweat a LOT. If that's a feeling you can't deal with, don't use them solely for working out with.

I have somewhat small ears so these are more like an over ear than on ear fit for me. They stay pretty comfy for a long time.

Bluetooth does work and sounds as good as wired. I liked the fact it has a wire connection as a backup when the battery runs out.

The volume is still more than plenty using it in Bluetooth mode, unless you want to lose your hearing. I use it with an iPod. This is the best price for quality wireless headphones. But beware, you may find it for less elsewhere. I got mine for $99 at Target, but they were very hard to find when I was looking. They were sold out at most Targets and everywhere else. The Camo's are $99 here. I suspect they must not be popular in that motif. I prefer the black because unless you are hunting or on combat duty, camo is ridiculous.

I wanted my search for bluetooth headphones to be over, but it's not.  First thing I noticed when I opened the package was how well built and durable they felt.  I knew that, at the time, I was really going to like them.  Nice big easy to feel buttons on the right side.  Nice easy to see ""R"" and ""L"" on the band so I can throw them on in the right direction quickly.  I thought ""wow, this is a nicely designed unit.""  Then I was ready to plug them in and charge them for the first time...wait...where's the micro-USB charging port?  On the right botton next to the controls?  Nope.  On the left ear next to the 3.5mm jack?  Nope.  I had to go to the manual to find that they're on the top of the left speaker under the headband.  Wait, what?  You have all this easily accessible real estate on the outside edge of either speaker and you tuck it away in the worst possible location?  It takes me probably 5-10 seconds longer to plug them in (usually requiring shifting my finger position at least once to get the plug to the right angle.  Easily and without question the worst charging port position I've ever seen.  But oh well, if the rest of the headphones are as good as I'm expecting them to be, it's a small price to pay, right?  So I paired the headphones with my mobile device.  It was probably easiest pairing I've ever done.  Plus the ascending and descending power on/off tones are a nice touch.  I've had devices that give you the same beep for both and when they're on your ear, you can't tell if that's the ""on"" beep or the ""off"" beep.  So these tones were nice.  Next I fired up Pandora and was greeted to a rich audio experience with just the right amount of base.  Very nice.  The noise isolation, which isn't the best I've heard, is adequate for the most part I guess.  I switched Pandora station to classic rock and hammered the volume, ""Let's see how loud we can get!""  Well, turns out not very loud.  The max volume is again, adequate.  You an hear everything and for the most part is enough but I would love to crank some AC/DC and get lost in an Angus Young riff but the volume just isn't quite there.  But oh well, if the rest of the headphones are as good as I'm expecting them to be, it's a small price to pay, right?  Then a track came up that I didn't much care for so I thought I'd advance to the next one.  Turns out the volume buttons double as the FWD/NEXT buttons.  Do a long-press on the volume up button and it advances to the next track.  To pause/play the music you tap the power button.  Clever.  I'm happy with this interface.  But as I'm listening to the music I realized that the headphone cushion is round and not oval shaped as most over-the-ear headphones I've used and is pushing the top of my ear against my head.  It was kinda annoying but figured the designers knew what they were doing.  Well, after two full days of using these headphones the tops of my ears hurt and last night I had a head ache I feel was caused by the pressure.  So even though I like the ease of use, sound quality and controls of these headphones the rest of the experience is annoying and even painful, it's too big a price to pay.  My search for decent bluetooth headphones isn't over yet.",01-16-2015,01-16-2015

They are not bass heavy so if that is what you like, you may want to go with the Beats.  These headphones give a nice clean sound and they are very comfortable.  As a kid, I was always teased about my big ears. I was shocked at how comfortable these headphones fit over my big ears.  I use them for roughly 5 hours a day at work and have no complaints.

They are well constructed with a great rubbery/plastic feel which is hardly a problem.  They are very easy to sync with any Bluetooth device and the features to answer and end phone calls if using a cell phone works great.  The only draw back I noticed is that when I answer a call using the phone and not the headphones, the music does not restart in the headphones but comes from the phone's speaker instead.  So, it's best to use the button on the headphones to answer and end calls.  As far as distance goes, I was able to walk 27 feet away from my phone before the music began to cut out.  I'm not sure how that stacks up against other Bluetooth headphones.

Anyone else not impressed by Beats or their prices?  Bought some beats and now want wireless?  Lost or broke your existing headphones?

These are your headphones.  You can pick them up for around $100 most of the time vs the Beats bluetooth for around $350.

I bought these at a brick and mortar because Amazon didn't have these headphones when they first came out, and I searched.  Sorry Amazon :)  If you have heard the Skullcandy Aviators, then you know the kind of headphones this company can make.  The Hesh sound like bluetooth versions of the Aviators to me.

Pros:

Sound
Range
Passive Noise Cancelling (not active but does well enough for use during mowing and yard work)
Connectivity (I have a lot of issues with my Plantronics earbuds with staying connected or re-connecting, these are great)
Controls on the right ear cup are usable and function reliably
Volume up and down are in fact volume up and down (also fwd and back for audio if you hold the button longer than a tap)
Comfort (I wear these for 4 hour stints with no issues, this beats out my old Sony wired headset)
Battery life is good, no problems yet, haven't had them turn off as I charge each night
Nice charging port on top of the left ear cup (behind the arm)
Will play while it's charging, not a standard feature in this genre
Materials/feel/design is all very modern and pleasing

Cons:

Not as loud on Bluetooth (using the cable isn't terrible and boots the sound noticeably)
They don't fold for storage or travel
Fabric covering the drivers seems to be loose after just a few uses
No easy way to check battery level with any accuracy (offers flashing LED response but only when battery is low, give me a 100/75/50/25/10% check voice or LED)

Overall these are amazing headphones and I couldn't be happier that I didn't fall in to the Beats trap.  I shopped, listened and waited for the right thing.  These look and sound right.  I listen to a little of everything and this handles it all cleanly.

Great for anyone who loves music, podcasts, audiobooks, or just watching some video on your phone/laptop/tablet.  These even pair nicely with my Dish Network Hopper so that I can watch loud action movies/tv shows at a good volume while my 22 month old daughter sleeps.

DON'T PURCHASE UNTIL THE MARK UP DROPS! READ ON FOR DETAILS ON HOW TO PURCHASE!,"DO NOT PURCHASE! THIS CARD WILL DROP SIGNIFICANTLY IN PRICE POINT AFTER 10-15 DAYS!

Ladies and Gentlemen of Amazon, these cards are released on June 10, 2016 at a $449 price point for an early release ""founders edition""

The ""HYPE"" is real! It is an amazing card, hence the 5 stars, it's faster than the Titan X... HOWEVER!!! READ ON!!!

This is the first time NVIDIA will be competing against partners like EVGA to sell the card directly.

This means their cooler design with the ""Vapor chamber"" that they try to upsell you to the $449 Founders edition for IS NOT WORTH IT EITHER!

PLEASE WAIT UNTIL THIS CARD DROPS TO THE REASONABLE $349 MSRP THAT IT SHOULD BE!

On a side note,

THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE IN ANY MATERIAL OR DESIGN USED, BETWEEN THE FOUNDERS EDITION CARDS, AND THE REGULAR CARDS SHIPPED SHORTLY AFTERWARD.

The Founder's edition is another way of saying Reference Card and another way to charge those who want the card on the very first day, an extra 100 bucks.

Partners like EVGA will come out with Custom Cards with liquid cooling and so forth, for around the same price point.

These cards will come factory overclocked and superclocked, and will have different types like the ""Kingpin"" edition which uses premium copper for heat dissipation on the 980 Ti

Please wait, be patient for 14 days, and then order a custom card from NVIDIA partners.

That is my best advice to you Amazonians.

Good luck and happy gaming",06-08-2016,06-08-2016

I have several I have built that I use at home, and at work. It has been a hobby since about 1994. I used to surrender to the urge of getting the very best component you could possibly get when building a PC or whatever electronic system. And if that is what you want, there is nothing wrong with that. But in the last few years, I have made it a goal to make the best desktop PCs for workstation, and gaming at the lowest possible price. This card is amazing for how cheap it is (yes 380 dollars plus tax is cheap). I spent $400 on a card back in 2006/2007 just on the cusp of AGP going out and PCI-E coming in, and that wasn't even as much as I could have spent back then. So this price for what it can do is insane. There is not a game that requires 8GB of video RAM. Sure some games are made poorly and require a lot of power (Kingdom Come: Deliverance) and if you enable certain graphics options it can get up to the 8GB maybe... but in general it isn't necessary. The difference between the 1070 and 1080 is small when comparing the price difference ($100-$200 depending). In this range of cards, the 1070 is in a sweet spot. So unless you plan on spending 1000 or more, this card is the best for the price in this range.",09-17-2018,09-17-2018

Overclocked out of the box, it reaches 1974Mhz. I gave it a +136 offset and it reaches 2050Mhz on average now so it probably has some more overhead in a cooler room, or if you put the fan speeds up. The asynchronous fans are awesome for noise levels, with the gpu core fan on the left usually spinning at all times. Temps never get above 73C.
.  Having shoved this card into a Bitfenix prodigy case, I don't have a lot of height space to work with, on account of the optical drive. If you were to forego the optical drive, if would fit just fine with some height to spare. I also have a 200mm front intake and I was able to fit the card without any clearance problems on the front. Considering the small size of my case, you can expect temperatures well below 73C with proper airflow in a bigger case.  I have seen this when I had lower ambient temps in my room, when cranking the ac.  I imagine a mid-tower case would see this thing being very quiet and keeping good temperatures, even at full utilization. A great buy. Although the current shortage has lead to a inflated price.

I have 2 1080p freesync (Yes Freesync) displays that both run @ 75Hz I use upscaling on them to play my games. Which with this card every game I've thrown at it plays maxed out. I hope to get better monitors soon but for now everything's works as it should. This card says max boost is around 1750-1800Mhz but most card I've seen max boost out around 2000Mhz benchmark wise my card sits close to a stock founders 1080 for 20% less cost I'll take it. :-) Buy this if you can't justify the price hike for a 1080 especially if you own 1080p monitors go for it. Beats out my crossfire rx480 I sold for this plus way less micro stutters.

1. Item bought as new, but the factory seal was cut (image is attached).
2. There were no plastic coverings that should be on the new item (e.g. on back-plate).
3. There is a label stuck to a box with the text ""LPN RR 30236 0026""(image is attached). I googled a little bit and found that this kind of labels are stuck to a !!!RETURNED!!! items. Maybe I have wrong info regarding LPN abbreviation, if someone can clarify what does it mean, please let me know.
4. And finally... the card does not work and I'm starting the return/refund process from the next Monday. A sad thing is that the card is outside of the USA and I have to pay for the shipping (to USA) and take care that the card will be in USA within 30 days return period.

If you have the money, the 1080 is a much better card and will run games faster, farther into the future than the 1080.  Also if you already own a 980 TI, R9 295X2, R9 Fury X, or better, the 1070 will not be an upgrade and you should consider the 1080.

I purchased the FTW with 1797 clock, the 08G-P4-6276-KR version. EVGA makes several versions of this card and it can be difficult to determine what the difference between them is.  I will try to do so here.

Glossary
Blower Cooling - Cooling that uses a blower style cooler and heatsink.  Economical design.
ACX3.0 Cooling - Advanced cooling system using variable speed fans and heatsinks.  Good design.
iCX Cooling - Evolution of ACX3.0 including additional thermal sensors and technology.  Best fan and heatsink design
Hybrid Cooling - Closed loop water cooling that requires mounting a radiator on the back of the case.  Very effective cooling

Backplate - A metal sheet that is placed over the back of the card further protecting the electronics, and improving heat handling capabilities.
RGB LED - An LED that can change color programmatically to any color.  Easily match the color of other items inside your case to maximize flexibility in design.

10 Phase Power - An enhanced power supply design that will deliver more consistent power to the graphics processor to insure reliable operation.  More phases means cleaner power, and greater power capacity.  The other design is a 4 phase design.

8 pin connector - Add in graphics cards need additional power provided to them.  This is typically done with an 8 pin connector from the power supply.  Some older cards used 6 pin connectors, so some power supplies provide 6+2 connectors, while others provide 8 pin connectors.  You need to make sure that you have the proper number of 8 pin connectors (or 6+2) or you will not be able to power your graphics card and it will not work.  A 6 pin connector will not work, it does not supply enough power, or fit for that matter.  If you do not have either 8 pin or 6+2 pin connectors available, you will need to upgrade your power supply.  This is common in older computers, as well as name brand computers from Dell and HP.  The power supplies were not designed for high power add in cards.

I chose the model I did, because it had ACX cooling, and the 1797 clock with the 10 phase power and RGB LED.  The more expensive cards offered very little benefit.

If the 1070 is just too much of as stretch for the budget consider the 1060 at 6GB (not enough savings to go to 3GB).  Be aware that the 1060 is comparable to the 970, 708 or Titan.  It is also comparable to the Radeon RX580/570/480/470, R9 390/290 or Intel HD7990.  If you own one of those it will not be an upgrade.
http://amzn.to/2vyqP6K

If the budget is really tight you should look at the 1050.  Be aware that the 1050 is on par with the 950, 760 or 660 Ti.  It is also comparable to the Rx460, R7-370, R9-270 or Intel Hd 7870.  This card will not be an upgrade if you have one of those or better.

Batman Arkham Asylum (for funsies)

During gaming I don't even need to overclock it as Witcher 3 with Ultra settings (I disabled hair works) on 1080P runs in the 100-150FPS range on stock clocks. For mining I have it overclocked to +100mv, core +125mhz, Mem +675mhz in MSI Afterburner. The memory clock is too high to game with as you'll see artifacts, but for mining it works out to 30.5MH/s with ETH without difficulty. The card runs nearly 24/7 and I've never seen the temps exceed 45c even after 16+ hours of load. When I want to overclock for games I usually do a mild OC of core +125 mhz, Mem +400-550mhz. I could push it higher but I'm running on a 1080p TV at 60HZ. In Far Cry 4 and Just Cause 3 the FPS on max settings is in the 150FPS range so I turn on Vsync to keep it consistent and the GPU never goes above a 50% load. I don't regret this card one bit, and since it can mine decently it will eventually pay for itself (6+month for ROI atm). I've played with my friends GTX 1060, but this 1070 walks all over it. My setup is: GTX 1070 (this card), Ryzen 5 1600 OC'd to 3.925ghz, Samsung 960 evo M.2 SSD 250gb, 2TB seagate drive for my games, Team Dark Ram 2 8GB sticks running at 3066 mhz, Corsair RM100x 1000 watt PSU, etc. This card scores a 12563 on passmark with core +125 and mem +550.

Free from EVGA, but still a pain. The thermal pad issue was announced by EVGA on November 1st of 2016 and my order was placed on February 3rd of 2017. 3 months and they apparently hadn't cycled out their inventory yet. What's worse is that there's a potential fire hazard if you don't perform the mod and outside of personal research, EVGA has no system setup to notify owners if their units are affected. One star down for that.

As far as card usage goes, I've been getting pretty great gaming performance using my 1st gen Razer Blade Stealth and Razer Core. I don't have all the latest games, but it runs Doom, Fallout 4 and everything else I've thrown at it on ultra without a problem. The bottleneck I experience on some games is the CPU in my laptop (i7-6500u), but I still stay well above 30 FPS no matter what.

I've also started stressing the card by folding proteins (Folding@Home) and it's not performing  as well as I thought it would. I'm currently in the process of figuring out why... I suspect it's due to the limited bus bandwidth of the Razer Core's Thunderbolt 3 connection, but I haven't confirmed yet. I know this card is capable of 600k PPD (I'm only getting ~100k) so I'll try and update this review once I've learned more.
5/24/17 Update:
I got it folding correctly. Getting over 600k PPD now. Also running the card at 2.1GHz with some slight voltage bumps. The limit of PCI-e 3.0 x4 doesn't seem to be a problem at all with FAH. The bus only runs at about 20-25% usage while folding full throttle.

The other reason I dropped a star is because the EVGA Precision XOC software is pretty craptastic. It crashes and hangs more than it should, but also has a poorly laid out interface. I realize this isn't going to affect most users as the card will function just fine without the software, but for me, it is a part of the product experience and is marketed as a feature from EVGA.

If the EVGA software gets an update and starts working better, I'll bump this review up to 4 stars. nVidia has made one hell of a graphics chip and it deserves better vendor support.",05-22-2017,05-22-2017

Although I have the version without replacement thermal pads, I haven't noticed temperature problems in the GPU.  However, I would recommend downloading and installing the latest firmware from EVGA to be on the safe side.

My only complaint is with configuring the EVGA Precision XOC software.  Recommend using MSI Afterburner or similar monitoring programs

First off the hybrid version is a good inexpensive nice feature. When I water cooled the R9-290s, it cost me an additional $90.00 to upgrade each card with the AMD metal plate, fan and radiator. This is a steal compared to doing it later. That said, I use the cards for Prepar3d flight simulator in SLI mode ( CrossFire not supported) and this is the first time I don't have to overclock the video Card to get good performance in my sim. I will overclock it but this is the first time I can just plug and play and the settings are maxed out. When I am in my aircraft sitting in LAX, my frames are at 25fps. That is outstanding. These are great cards thay are quite and perform well. Write now without overclock my temps are in the low 40s at full load. I did some small overclock tests and already I know I have a lot of headroom when I do overclock these cards. The hybrid is the best price value card in the group, powerful, good price over upgrading later, and what I have seen and heard,  overclocking these boards are a snap and good performers.

I am by no means an expert, but I did my research and found that the 1070 was probably best suited for my needs, and having used several EVGA components in the past I decided to stick with what I felt was the best.

I am so glad I did.

For starters, I built my daily driver PC roughly 1.5 years ago and it started life with an EVGA 750 SC TI. For what I was doing at the time it worked well. It handled most games I played in the medium to high range with some settings adjusted, and I thought I would be happy. I thought wrong. The FTW2 model I purchased was and is as the kids put it eloquently ""Off the chain"". Now, all current games I play are ultra settings, and it just churns out those precious FPS. I paired it with an i7 4790k and it works like buttered toast.  Wait tastes like buttered toast. no... erm.. Its just great.

Installation was a breeze, although I did end up pulling my system apart to clean and perform some wire management. This card is long, so make sure you check specs and measure before you purchase so you aren't stuck needing to buy a new case or move other peripherals around. I only had to move my HDD to fit it. It does require two (2) eight (8) pin power connectors, so make sure you have those available. I currently use a fully modular 650watt PS from EVGA, and it works just fine.

Running the card was as easy as booting my system, ensuring settings in BIOS read everything correctly and then booting to windows. I found on initital startup the login screen was not nearly as harsh on the reds. Don't know why it changed, but it changed for the better. Currently I am running three monitors with this setup and configuration was already set. I downloaded the precisionOC from EVGA (protip: make sure you have your cards serial number ready, as its needed to download) and fired it up. The interface is clean, with each item able to be hovered over with the mouse for a small description of that item.

You know the cooling fiasco of VRMs in EVGA ACX cooling. They tried to solve it somehow. I think they were concerned about life span of the chips therefore suggested pad mod and vbios updates. Eventhough they listened to customers and reacted very fast, they should have seen this issue before starting serial production. Therefore they lost 1 star in my mind.

Overall performance and core cooling are very good.
With fan speed at %100, core temps doesn't go ever 59C in furmark stress test which is very good

OC performance differs very much based on your luck. However if I am buying FTW version, I would expect card to achieve certain OC numbers.

I've purchased this to hold me over until AMD releases it's Vega Cards this summer and this card has not dissapointed. I run any game I want on max settings, 1080p from 60-100fps all day. This card puts out a small amount of heat but that is to be expected from a high performance GPU. The fans on this card are very quite and I am happy with the noise level. Installation is a breeze and it comes with a cool poster for your wall. The reason for 4 stars? Overclocking.... This is about as overclocked as it gets right out of the box. Ive had some success in ramping up the settings, but the benchmark results from any increase in Frequency or voltage are not enough to justify doing it. In most cases, an increase in frequency or voltage had reverse effects and I saw a decline in bechmark scores. That being said, straight out of the package its a great video card, and will play all games with ease right now so I would suggest buying it.

Using EVGA Precision X, I have been able to get this card to run stable at about 2075+/- MHz on CPU clock and 4330 MHz+/- on Mem clock. That is +100 to CPU and +250 to MEM for those interested. That is with Power Target set to 110% and Temp Target set to 90deg. I suggest turning on fan control and setting the fan curve to Aggressive if you plan on doing this.

Another reason I gravitated to EVGA was the aesthetic of the card - the FTW and FTW2 cards have the full RGB lighting on the side with the fans plus the logo lights up - this is a plus for me.

I installed the card in my system without a hitch and it runs perfectly.  This card is a BEAST and will handle gaming at 1440p with little to no issues whatsoever, depending on what game you are playing - the ones I've tested so far have no issues.  Running the card while gaming and monitoring with MSI Afterburner, the temperatures stayed within good limits, so you won't have to worry about any thermal issues.  If you have any worries, the Precision XOC software you can download from EVGA offers options for your card, like controlling fan speed, overclocking, and customizing the LED color on the card.

I know there are cheaper 1070 cards out right now, but I wanted the latest offering from EVGA, and honestly, I am not disappointed one bit.

Since I can post links in a review, you can find 75 pages worth of this issue on the nvidia geforce board by searching: gtx-1080-high-dpc-latency-and-stuttering/1/

I currently have this: EVGA SuperClocked+ 02G-P4-2684-KR GeForce GTX 680 2GB and it's been ROCK SOLID for years (also have a 10 year warranty on it,) and just wanted to upgrade just for more ram (and better performance), as GTA V plays well on the GTX680, but I want the extended draw distance (2GB is very limiting), and wanted to skip Volta, so this would be a more affordable solution, skip 1080, skip Volta, and get the 3070/3080 when the 1070 becomes too under-powered for a 4K screen (currently using 1080P)

I bought the EVGA 1070FE a few days ago from Amazon and it's still sealed (it's a lot of work of setting all 4 monitors up with DP to HDMI connectors and annual cleaning of the machine, so I held off) and now after reading the stutter issues, I'm hesitant of trying it out since Amazon charges a 15% restock fee on opened PC parts.

It seems some amazon reviews also report stuttering, so if anyone can comment on this, I would greatly appreciate it.

Also, this is not an EVGA issue, but a Nvidia issue -- I just posted this here because I did buy the EVGA 1070FE from Amazon.

I'm using a case that is literally as small as you can get while still using standard PC parts. I'll include a photo (970 is shown). Before while gaming the case would get HOT to the touch at the top/front (exhaust end). Now the case just gets warm after hours of gaming. I get more power, less heat and less noise.

Same thing I told EVGA, we don't game in clean rooms...don't sell a WHITE card and void Warranties for dust...seriously?

2nd) Amazon, although directly linked from their site, did not Honor the 'For Honor' game code (pun intended lol) and neither would EVGA. I honestly don't care much for either free game honestly, but I don't like getting yanked around by the chain over stupid BS either.

3rd) It's WHITE and dust void's the Warranty lol...sorry, still a little peeved about that one.

Pros:

Great Customer Service so far--will change this review if thing's change.

I was offered an iCX Upgrade immediately after purchase for $99 buck's. (read fan con's below lol)

NOTE: The iCX upgrade option was over as of writing this.

iCX Upgrade or not, 90 day Step-Up Program to get a better model (at a cost, of course...but nice regardless) is a pretty sweet deal.

In my I-7 6700K
MSI Gaming M7
32GB DDR4
Toshiba P300 7200rpm HDD (Yeah, I know...lol)
144Hz DAS (Dynamic Action Sync) LG Monitor

My never overclocked build kills modern console's easily..

Cons:

Precision XOC crashes almost every boot (likely fighting MSI Command Center for control) so I can't say if it's common or not.

Had to run DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) and even after that, my less graphical HDD (VS 10) has blue dots I never seen before loading Win 7.

At default fan speed (with Precision X) it make's a squealing noise, was givin suggestions to losen screw's AND even offered a replacement on spot. Guess that's a Con and a Pro really.

You have to pay up-front for 'Army' (get your card before returning defect's) within 90 days, and the iCX has no option for it even if you did. BS

I want to lose the squeal and it's pay $100 for ship first, or pay $100 for a new cooling system, and it's STILL white haha. WTF EVGA?

All in all if you don't mind the horrible color or the even worse warranty deal about it, it run's everything I throw at it at 1080p 144Hz. Lost a star for the idiot who gave a white card that kind of warranty...and for the pay first to ship first where a dusty white card may get rejected ANYWAYS and you lose the money flat out. Other than that, it's actually a really good card.

No major complaint's, so far at least. The customer service does make up for most of the minor issues and hopefully will be considerate if the card does happen to get a bit dirty. Time will tell.",03-01-2017,03-01-2017

Sure, the 1080 (and upcoming 1080Ti) are faster, but they also cost far more.  In fact, if you break down frames-per-second per dollar spent, those higher-end cards are a terrible value.  The 1060 is also a great card, but has limitations.  I purchased the 1070 and have been very happy with it (this is my 4th eVGA card, never had an issue).  It's powerful enough to run anything I throw at it, but was 60% cheaper than a 1080 when I purchased it.  I use it to run Steam VR and my HTC Vive, and I've never had any frame rate issues.  I also play a variety of games (FPS, MMORPG, Racing) on max settings (1080p) with 60+FPS with no problem.  Gaming at 1440p is also quite smooth, though for 4K you'd need a beefier setup.

I upgraded from a Radeon R9 200 which isn't a bum (except for the software/drivers) I've had an 860M in my gaming laptop and it's still going strong 2 yrs later.

I ran this GPU under Passmarks bench tool and it scored in the 99th percentile. Now I take that with a grain of salt but given it had absolutely no issues with the 3D DirectX 12 test I can't complain.

I play Final Fantasy 14 and constantly had issues with the R9. Artifacting, freezing and crashing in the normal AFK zones like Idyllshire. I couldn't go from the aetheryte to the vendor without a freeze. I had my graphics set to basic and FPS at 30. Still crashed.

I did nothing else but swap out the GPUs and now I'm on max settings and I've limited it to 60 FPS. The card stays a cool 45c under load and no more freeze ups or crashes. I run two clients on max setting at the same time and have yet to feel any stress from this card.

I absolutely love NVidia hardware; I could never go back to Radeon. I've had nothing but issues with AMD the last 4-5 yrs and some longer. If you want a hard that stays cool and performs as expected, get this.

You will need a full tower. I have the Raidmax Augusta case and it fits perfectly. Because I'm water cooling the CPU I chose to modify the front of the case and place my graphics card cooler there. No problems whatsoever.

My setup:
i7 4790K
GTX 1070 FTW
Corsair 32 GB ram DDR3 2133
Samsung 850 Evo
ASRock Z97 Extreme
Corsair 1300 watt Platinum PSU
Corsair H110 CPU cooler
Basic Samsung Blu-Ray Drive
Toshiba HD-DVD drive

I will update this review if I find any negativity and/or if it performs solid for a few months.

Last thought: cooler and lines feel solid. I just can't believe how impressed I am from the get go.

Update: 3/13/2017 - card has been fantastic! I built a new PC with an Intel i7700k and DDR4 @3300 MHz ram. I bought a second card to go in the new build and my temps never reach above 55c.

Rather that focus only on this card, I'd like to give potential buyers some perspective by sharing my unique experience of comparing three different GPUs over the course of one month. I started with a GTX 770, then bought this GTX 1070 SC, then very recently upgraded to 1080 SC (all EVGA).

1. GTX 770: I had great framerates (~50-60) in BF1 on med-high, similar on Witcher3 on high and no hairworks. Tomb Raider 2013, 60+ no tressfx. In short, a very happy gaming experience but just no extra-fancy bells & whistles. I had an ASUS 1ms 60hz 1080p monitor at this time.

2. I gave away 770 to a deserving student of mine (I'm a high school teacher) and bought a 1070 SC as well as an ROG swift 144hz GSYNC 1080p monitor. BF1, ultra @ 70-85fps, W3 65-80 w/ hairworks, R6:Siege 80-95fps on ultra. GSYNC on all. A extremely satisfying experience, to be sure. BUT - it's worth noting that I really didn't see/feel much of a difference between my experience on the 770 and on the 1070. Other than slightly smoother minimum rates, I never really noticed all the extras that much. Yeah, if I looked I could see them, but do you really count how many rocks there are on a patch of ground as you run past it? I'd say that I got about a 25% increase in satisfaction over the 770. No coil whine, either.

3. Well, I gave that 1070 away to another (really!) deserving student and got myself a 1080 SC for my birthday. BF1 @ 95-130, W3 75-95, R6:Siege @ 120-140. I actually didn't expect such a jump in numbers, I'd thought it'd be minimal since my CPU stayed the same. But you could definitely feel the difference in minimum frame rates compared to the 1070, and having the games run close to my refresh rate probably was noticeable too. I'd say the increase in satisfaction over the 1070 was about another 20%. Yeah, statistics from Duenor's school of analysis. If it wasn't for a coil whine problem, I'd be supremely happy since I had expected hardly any difference. Oddly everyone says that BF1 is CPU dependent but in my experience it was W3 that had the least improvement over the 1070. BF1 I could definitely feel it being smoother. Yeah I know people will try to tell me that I'm wrong, it's all in my head, only fighter pilots can tell the diff between 60fps and 144fps let alone 85 and 130, but that's how I feel and I'm sticking to it.

Anyway, I'm totally happy with the EVGA treatment of the 1070 and 1080 SC (non black edition, I like my backplates) in build & performance. Right now as I'm going through RMA for the 1080 I'm using an EVGA 9800GT from 2008(?). You know what? I'm pretty happy with it, too! I'm playing Enslaved: Oddyssey with a great FPS, playing South Park, playing Ori:Blind Forest. I might play CS:GO in a little bit and I bet it'll run great, too. UserBenchmark says my gaming rig is now a ""Surfboard"", which is one step above ""Tree Trunk"", haha. But I'm getting plenty of enjoyment out of this, too. So the moral of all this is that I don't think one should look too much at numbers. If you're happy with your card, that's all that matters. If you're not, it's hard to go wrong with either the 1070 or 1080 - and I can definitively say that the 1080 is noticeably better than the 1070, even on the humble 1080p that I prefer.",02-05-2017,02-05-2017

These things get hot like they radiate so much heat its like a large capacity space heater. Placing two of these in a case is lunacy, but i never said i was sane. Fits in a corsair carbide 540 just fine. Fitted an msi gpu bolster in there to keep everything on the level. Works fantastic. Hottest theve gotten is 54 degrees C. Which isn't bad at all. The fans push a decent amount of air thru the radiator, though im considering getting higher static pressure and flowing fans to upgrade to. They are super quiet on max fans in precision software, it makes virtually no sound difference, they're low rpm fans going from 1200rpm to just over 2000. The cards themselves are beautiful, like fine art beautiful the lines and the metal on the backplate and fan cover are amazing in person. Pictures do no justice. Gaming im getting around 90 to 160 fps in elite dangerous maxxed out with supersampling to 2.0 dropped to lowest of just under 70 where my dual 970s would drop to 40 and stay under 60 in alot of cases (on an AOC 35"" 2560x1080 21:9 160hz monitor), haven't tested much else yet.

The deciding factor was the quality of the card and the reputation of EGVA customer service. This card is paired with a Dell UltraSharp 34"" curved monitor and the results are spectacular. Two days after it was installed, my computer ""lost"" it during a Nvidia  driver upgrade. My husband called EGVA 24/7 live customer support and spoke to an American representative within 5 minutes. He knew exactly what to do, our problem was fixed quickly, and the rep told us how to keep this sort of problem from re-occurring in the future when Windows decides to update a driver..

The only semi con is that I get coil noise with this card. I don't dock the card, apparently this is a power supply issue (from what I've read on the forums), so my usually quiet machine gets a little rowdy when I first start up a game. Not a biggie to me, just a note.

I was running an EVGA GTX 950. With that I couldn't set any current games to ultra and get a playable frame rate (intel i7-4790K 4ghz, 8 gig ram, Asus 144hz gaming monitor, Coolermaster HAF X case). I could play games on high and some ultra settings and get 30 to 50 frames per second. Here's a list of some of those games for reference:

Skyrim Special Edition (heavily modded)
Far Cry 4
The Witcher 3
Dragon Age Inquisition
Dying Light

Now... same computer, but with this card... I am playing all of those games (and more) set to Ultra settings on all features, and I'm getting 50 to 100+ frames per second. I'm even playing The Witcher 3 with everything including ""hairworks"" set as high as possible. It's amazing.

I'm not interested in 4K gaming right now. I run 1080p... so I see no need for a GTX 1080. The 1070 is a sweet spot for me. My games have never run better and I'm having a blast.

It's not running hot (it's a newer one) and it's quiet. I love the look. I have been using EVGA cards for many years now, and I continue to be very happy with every one I buy!

One little word of advice to anyone who is looking for a new graphics card and is currently running an AMD CPU, DO NOT UPGRADE TO THIS CARD.

I run an AMD FX-8320 and I only get 45-50 fps on max settings in some games that would usually hit 60 easily according to benchmarks online. I made the mistake of not upgrading my CPU first so now my games are bottlenecking. My old graphics card (GTX 770) was a good card, but the 2GB of ram was not enough for the types of games I played, so I thought it would be a good idea to upgrade in 2016.

Solid performance and a huge upgrade from 700 series like I had been using. EVGA's parts on the other hand are terrible. With any of the ACX cards you either pick poor thermal performance, or deal with extra noise (both electrical and fan) by adding the thermal updates. It's a shame considering EVGA's past of having the best and longest warranty. Now the warranty is much shorter, and it really shows in their design and build quality.

I opted for better thermals without knowing the electrical noise could happen. My guess is the thermal pad placement is causing it, but EVGA can't fix it for everyone without a full recall. Maybe they'll extend everyones warranties for free like last time a similar situation happened.

Currently, I'm suck in an RMA loop with EVGA.
RMA 1 which swapped a pre-thermal problems card for a card with the updated VBIOS and thermal pads.
RMA 2 swapped the thermal pad and vbios updated card from RMA 1 due to a loud clicking noise that exceeded the noise level of the fans as fast as I've seen them go (about 30-40%)
RMA 3, if approved, will be the same as RMA 2 since the new card has an identical, though slightly quieter noise issue.

Luckily the RMA's have been with the advanced RMA system with cross-shipping, but I'm sure EVGA will stop doing that if more RMAs are needed. It's just not viable for them, or really for me either. After enough RMA's the cost quickly approaches the difference in price between the 1070 I bought and a 1080 without the issue. Without some sort of consumer protection laws though, EVGA can get away with leaving customers with cards with shoddy solutions to serious design flaws that are capable of severe damage (and not just to the cards).

I really hope EVGA will work on redeeming themselves after this. Sorting out these issues out for everyone is a must. If it is a case of the extra pads causing this sort of noise, then EVGA should find a better solution. If they can't, then offer refunds or a modified trade up program to cards without the issue (ie designed for proper thermals instead of modded for proper thermals).

Such a large drop in consistently and quality from EVGA is out of character when remembering their past. It's very close to, or already at, the point where me and many others are no longer considering EVGA, and rightfully so. These sorts of components aren't cheap, and no one in the market is happy to buy ones that may blow circuits or catch fire. The current issue also hugely effects resell on these cards, which used to be an area EVGA cards were strong in.",12-09-2016,12-09-2016

I was quite frustrated with the lack of AMD Crossfire support for the R9 390X in Crimson software, and as of this writing, Team Red has nothing to offer at the ""high end"", although I know Vega is due out shortly. Since I recently purchased a new 32"" 2560 X 1440 VA Panel Monitor (for all purpose, including some FPS Gaming), I needed some new Graphics Horsepower.

The GTX 1070 offerings are many, but I chose this particular Card due to the high quality of construction, EVGA Customer Service and Support, and I received a significant and stable overclock out of the box. The Marketing was not just hype, but the performance is truly there. With no adjustments, Nvidia Boost 3.0 has my Card running at 2012 Mhz in Game. I did apply a custom fan curve through MSI Afterburner, and my fans start up at 45 C. I never saw the temperature go above 65 degree C., and the fans are quiet. I am not getting any coil whine, and everything just works. My results at 2560 X 1440 in CRYSIS 3 and Metro Last Light are on Par with what the major reviews have already benchmarked for this Particular GTX 1070 FTW Card. I also like the 10 phase power, and the larger fans over the SC version. I have not Overclocked any further than the out of box settings thus far, but since I already have a significant overclock, I am not strongly compelled to test this further to obtain very small FPS gains. I would rather just move up to a GTX 1080 for that.

I can't comment on the EVGA Precision XOC Program, as I am not using it. I will stick with MSI Afterburner for now. While I think the idea of RGB lighting is pretty cool on the Card, I am personally satisfied with the pale blue color of the default LED color, and I am more satisfied that I do not have to run Precision XOC software just to fiddle with the RGB lighting. I am also staying away from the Nvidia Experience Software. I just do not need it.

I would like to add that I purchased this card, well aware that there have been some expressed concerns about the VRM cooling. As VRMs do run hot, (VGA Card, Motherboard), I do believe that cooling is important. I did go ahead and order the free thermal pad kit available from EVGA, and I will go ahead and install them. EVGA is also offering a BIOS update to address and remediate these concerns. I am pretty comfortable tearing down my PC equipment, and I build my own custom computers. I really like EVGA's approach to this concern, and it is one more reason why I am buying this particular video card from EVGA.

You can get any 1070 and they will perform about the same.  Here's why you should still pick an EVGA card.  They support their products even if they make a mistake.

Problems and mistakes can and do happen to anyone, even the best of us.  Great customer service is put to the test when problems arise.  I have always gotten great service and product support from EVGA which is why I will keep using them again in the future.

If you don't know what I'm talking about... cards shipped from EVGA before Nov 1st will need a BIOS update to address an overheating problem in the VRM.  Cards shipped after this date are fixed so do not let the ""VRM overheating issue"" scare you away from buying an EVGA card.

I bought one of these affected cards so I can speak for the level of support EVGA has gone above and beyond in my opinion to support this card.  Many graphics card vendors have terrible support and if something like this were to happen in manufacturing you would be stuck with a dud.  Luckily I picked this model and they were able to make everything right.

They fixed the issue reasonably quickly with a BIOS update and furthermore offered affected customers free thermal pads if they wanted to mod the card to fix the issue.  EVGA offered to do both of these for me if I shipped my card back to them, but I elected to do it myself.  I performed both the BIOS update and the thermal pad mods.  The BIOS update was simple and the thermal pad mod was only slightly more difficult than installing a CPU cooler.

Apart from EVGA's service here's my thoughts on the card itself:

Just tweaking a few settings without spending too much time on it I was able to overclock to about 2100mhz so I feel pretty comfortable with the ""silicon lottery"" on my specific card.  The RGB lighting is a nice touch.  It's not too obnoxious looking, but the lighting is on the bottom of the card on a standard ATX install.  The backplate at the top of the card looks really nice and adds a polished touch.

The fans are quiet, even with the BIOS update I did not notice any difference in the fan noise.  You can hear them when they are at their max, but I wouldn't call them loud.  The Precision X software for overclocking is pretty easy to use.  It was difficult to figure out how to change the RGB settings but you can do it two ways: through Precision X or by downloading a separate (hard to find) app from Nvidia called the ""led visualizer"" which was for some reason taken out of the most recent version of GeForce experience.",11-15-2016,11-15-2016

UPDATE: Those who have heard about the overheating GPU's with the ACX 3.0 on the 1070FTW as well as the 1080FTW know that NOT ALL THE CARDS will have the issue. My card has run at a stead 70C while running BF1 on Ultra settings for over 3 hours. I got in contact with NVidia and they told me they would send me the Thermal Pads free of charge to fix the issue or I could RMA it as well if I ever had any issues.

Anyways;

I recently picked up this card to replace my GTX970 SC as I thought it was time to upgrade to something that would allow me to run 4K at a decent FPS although I don't have a 4K monitor... yet.

The card itself is awesome, right out of the box, EVGA has the core notched up from 1,506MHz to 1,607MHz, while boost frequency is raised from 1,683MHz to 1,797MHz. The card while playing on BF1 rarely went above 600RPM's on the fans maybe because the H440's fan setups is allowing for optimal airflow which keeps the card cool while gaming on ultra settings.

The card itself is designed amazing as always by EVGA's standards and it just simply put amazing in any case that you can see the ""blind"" on the inside. The software provided by EVGA allows you to mess with the card (I don't suggest anyone OC'ing the card if you're new to over clocking although they do have a warranty which they always stand behind) settings such as the fan speeds, over clocking and even the RGB colors (Only on the FTW editions can you change the RGB on the card, most other cards are standard white)

All in all a solid build, runs amazing FPS on almost any game. GTAV ran a solid 60fps with no issues what soever while I rarely had a drop of below 90fps.",11-13-2016,11-13-2016

EVGA customer service isn't much help,"I bought this card to replace an older GTX660.  Shortly after installing this card, I started getting blue screen errors.  I did some research online and found the DDU program to remove old drivers - so I ran that twice - once to remove and the second time to verify.  Then I reinstalled the new drivers from the evga website.  Continued to get blue screen errors every other day or so - and the code indicated it was due to video hardware.

I submitted a support request to evga - I chose evga because I'd heard what great customer service they had.  The first tech said it could be hardware or software, and he suggested I run DDU to remove old drivers.  I replied to the ticket, saying that I'd already run DDU twice.  Three days later a different person replied with ""Thank you for the reply, yes please try to used that software again, it does help with clearing the older drivers or some files that was left over. But if the same issue occurs, try to replace or put the video card onto another system to see if same issue occur or not.""

If I had another computer system sitting around, maybe I wouldn't be as concerned about buying a faulty video card.  So much for EVGA's ""awesome customer service.""  I'm glad others have better experiences with them, but I won't be buying anymore of their products.",11-08-2016,11-08-2016

I've built a few custom gaming computers in the past, so I'm not a novice at this, and I could not get the computer to recognize the card was there.  I tried moving it to another PCI-e slot, using different power supply cables, with the 6pin-8pin adapter supplied with the unit and without, updated the BIOS and motherboard drivers.  Nothing worked.  I deleted the old card (an EVGA GTX 670 FTW) and manually loaded up the new card drivers.  Nothing.  Well, almost nothing...the only thing that works is the LED for the name on the side of the card...no fans.  The computer recognizes there is something there and I get the BIOS welcome screen, but that is it.  The computer would get to the BIOS welcome screen and freeze there.  When I put my old card back in, even with the drivers deleted, the computer booted right up, found the right drivers, and the card worked flawlessly.

My conclusion is I got a bad card.  This is not the first time I've gotten DOA parts, but it is the first time from EVGA.  Reading some of the horror stories about the EVGA GTX 1070 cards overheating and even smoking, this may be for the best.  Thankfully it's DOA instead of working for a few months before dying resulting in me having to RMA it...what a hassle that is.  I'm just returning it for a refund, and will look to see what other options are out there in the GTX 1070 range.",11-08-2016,11-08-2016

I use it to play Battlefield titles mostly. So since BF1 is a new game there are inherent problems in the game itself and I am trying to differentiate those from the card.

I have a very solid system Corsair 16gb ram, i7K processor, Samsung 500gb ssd, and a Corsair 850watt PS. My previous card was/is an EVGA GTX 780.

All temps are really low (EVO cpu cooler) - none of my hardware temps ever go above 45C - 48C. No overclocking on the vid card. CPU is overclocked to about 4.7 (had it over 5.1 though) - so good hardware.

I know that some people are having issues with heat.

However, I am not one of them. Under full load and stress testing, my unit NEVER goes over 48C (even after hours of playing BF1 on Ultra settings, 144Hz, about 85 to 110 fps). Currently I have on K Boost (have been leaving it on continuosly) and I am at 30C with 34% fan speed.

BTW my card has the dual BIOS and I flashed a BIOS update 4 days ago, it was super easy being done in Windows, and I have had no issues.

Another BTW, DX12 causes issues in some games - this is not the cards problem, it is a game code issue that is the problem, just use DX11 like I do in BF1 and all is good. I can't tell any difference any way.

I am writing this because I am concerned about future issues with the card. I can't afford to dump $400 bucks on a vid card that is going to break.

I don't really want to pay for the Extended Warranty/Enhanced cross shipping but maybe I will.

The only issues I have had is with nVidia GeForce experience and with a couple of aspects of the EVGA software.

nVidia software always causes shutdown issues (memory reference errors). I have only installed exactly the drivers I need which is the vid driver itself and the Physx software (custom install -> clean install). I think the nVidia Experience is buggy as heck, but it is ultra convenient to capture in-game video. But... if anyone has another solution, let me know.

EDIT: Seems like EVGA and nVidia have taken care of these problems since the last updates - do clean installs on all the software.

With the EVGA software I don't like the way the options are laid out for the lights - I can get the 2 demos to run, I can get the solid light, but not the breathing, etc (i should just work shouldn't it). Also it is REALLY irritating that I can't find more skins for the software AND it would be awesome to have some kind of instruction manual for overclocking. I can't even seem to find a video  on how to use the software to overclock.

I have had many EVGA cards and in the past I have had no issues teaching myself how to use the software.

Come EVGA gives us a tutorial and some nice skins. I know you like to make it look cool, but having everything so buried and hidden is NOT cool it is insipid.

Any way, I hope the card lasts, the video drivers will mature for the new games, but I too have had a video card go up in flames MANY years ago and it fried my motherboard also. So... if there is a real issue with this and the problems are not related to unskilled builders and cheap equipment, then not only are your risking a hassle with a vid card return, but if that PCI lane fries you are replacing a mobo also AND maybe other system components.

I ordered the exact wires to install the card to my psu at an additional cost of about $25, which had a small bridge in the 8 pin to gurantee it cant fit my psu.

I actually might return the card just because I cant install it.

Maybe its a sign to wait on upgrades until I can do my whole system and have a new psu with all the connectors ready to go.

Be warned, if you are going from an old 6 pin x2 connected GPU and upgrading for this, and you don't have a full set of PSU modular cords...you won't be installing this card.

Will hunt around for more wires, though its starting to get rather expensive to get this card installed....why the fck couldn't they just provide two cords to connect it to a modular PSU?

Unfortunately, it has a design flaw--the cooler does not directly cool the VRAM/VRM. That area of the card has been shown to hit temperatures of about 100 degrees Celsius under extreme loads at factor clock speeds(Furmark benchmark). EVGA is giving away thermal strips that you can apply yourself to the problem area but these only reduce the temps to the 80s. The worst part is that the card's temperature sensor will only tell you the temp of the gpu's main core so you will have no idea if the hotspot is in the danger zone. Anyone considering this card with it's extra powerphases and binned chip should definitely be hesitant given these troublesome temps are recorded at factory clocks. The cooler should really be redesigned but it's unlikely that the redesign would be given away for free. That I why I personally decided to return this.

The 2x8-pin connectors are probably overkill but I've still gotten some decent overclocking out of this card.

All tests were done on stock speeds with AA turned off. The only one that stands out is Deus Ex, which is the newest of these games. I think the card might benefit from newer drivers, but it is a very demanding game. I'm currently using this card in my mini-ITX gaming/streaming machine, which doesn't require anything crazy. On idle, it hovers around 30C, and during gaming loads, stays in the mid 70s. This is using the default fan curve. This is a great card at the mid $400 price point, and since there aren't really other choices at the moment, your decision is made for you.

But on to this EVGA GTX 1070. I had decided that for this build I was going Radeon since my monitors are FreeSync and I've had good experiences in the past, but the ordeal with GIGABYTE and the uninspiring performance of the RX480 convinced me to return to Nvidia.

So far I have been pleasantly surprised. This 1070 runs exceptionally cool and quiet, and while I'm not the type who wants my PC to drill rainbows into my eyes, the lighting and effects are clean, subtle, and easily disabled.

Currently waiting for a new card to ship.  This one has started to go to a black screen randomly and ramp the fan to 100%.  EVGA support troubleshooted for awhile, then suggested I get amazon to  replace it, since it would take them twice as long to ship me a new one.

Before it started messing up, it was tearing right through anything I could toss at it with no coil whine and fan sound that couldn't be heard over my other fans.  At max load I was under 60c  temps.

A few months ago I decided to build my own gaming PC with the help of a friend. Here are my specs:

Introducing GLaDos to all my geek friends out there!

Intel Core i7-5820K Haswell-E 6
ASRock Fatal1ty motherboard
Ripjaws 32GB DDR4 ram
480 GB SSD
4 TB HHD
Noctua NH-D15 6 heatpipe CPU Cooler
9 cooling fans (5 radial, 2 Graphics, 2 CPU)
Thermaltake VERSA N21 Snow Edition Case
EVGA 850 GS 80+ GOLD power supply

With all of that and the 1070, I am getting 60 and over frames per second and near ultra setting for most games including witcher 3, GTAV, and my MMO of choice Elder Scrolls Online. For the price, this card blows other out of the water. I have run some performance benchmarks with very good results. Will it be as good as running a 1080, I think only slightly less. Do you need multiple 1070 cards in your build? Not unless you want to be ridiculous. This card will beat any console out there and keep you gaming in top spec for a long time.",09-29-2016,09-29-2016

Even under load it's quieter than the old GTX 660 was at idle, so very impressed by the thermal management. Have not tried overclocking it beyond how it comes out of the box.

It's a big full-length card so be sure you have room for it if you're upgrading from something smaller.

The 8-pin power jack had a molding problem that prevented inserting the power plug all the way, but I was able to nibble away a bit of the jack and get it to latch properly after finally figuring out what the problem was after a half-hour of trauma. Hopefully not an issue that will be common.

Very happy with it so far.

I won't bore you with the details that everybody else will throw in your face, but here's some tidbits I learned:
- Having 3 monitors connected raised the gpu clock from 240 to just below 1000. Idle temps rose about 3-5C for me. I'm told it's due to different refresh rates of monitors, however disconnecting one of the monitors (60hz) and leaving two connected (60hz and 144hz) allowed the GPU clock to go back to 240.
- Custom fan curves only seem to work when EVGA PrecisionXOC software is open. Don't set it to 100% unless you're interested in sitting beside a small jet.
- When installing the card, for your own sake remove the old graphics card drivers. Saves the headache of defaulting to integrated (where available, and where not available the screen should just be black) graphics or the card just refusing to output anything.

Very happy.,"This card is awesome. For comparison, I upgraded from a gigabyte 7950 so of course it performs better but the design & build quality is noticeably better. For example, there is a supportive back plate. My last card was visibly sagging and that caused issues with the fans.

Focusing on this card, it runs quietly (please note that this card only runs the fans when needed and they'll be off otherwise). When the fans are on (under a game load) they are super quiet. The card boost itself past specification (I understand this is part of GPU Boost 3.0). For me (stock, mind you) the card is running at just over 1900 MHz. It's rated to boost at 1797 MHz and run at 1607 MHz.  These values are already higher than a reference 1070 and yet it performs better than it's advertised values.

This card has a lot more features too - things I hope to take advantage of but haven't yet due to time.

In summary, the card is not just what I expected based on the listing but way more. Highly recommend if you're in the market for a 1070.  If you are in the market for a 1080, I'd suggest you look at the 1080 version of this card. I'm sure that is just as awesome.",09-19-2016,09-19-2016

I bought my GTX 580 from Amazon's Warehouse Deals that's supposed to have a limited lifetime on it back in 2012. Limited lifetime if I had registered 30 after I have purchased it. When I went to file a RMA, you handed my case to a stupid Chinese customer service. I'm Vietnamese and my case was handled by a Chinese? You can look up who he is by using this serial number 1210611584000327 of my GTX 580. A supervisor name Jaeson Wilda tried to smooth it over by making it into a charity case as a one time offer to send me a replacement card. Well, frak EVGA and his offer. Limited lifetime warranty shouldn't be this difficult. I have a receipt of the legal purchase. So now with this GTX 1070 you're trying to put one over to your customers again with a long list warranty individually for every card? https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81tcHmtlitS.pdf

An incredible card that runs fast and incredibly cool. Nvidia knocked it out of the park. It overclocked automatically to around 2042 mhz, and dynamically allocates based on both temperature and processing power needed. You can push it farther, but I haven't found any reason to do that yet.

This card was capable even at 4k. Alien Isolation maxed out with no frame dips. Fallout 4 Maxed was around 40-60 frames. I typically game at 1440p and haven't come across a game that isn't max at that resolution with no sweat. Temperatures are at most high 60's C at all times. I don't think I've seen this get close to 70 C. Amazing how cool it is.

Now the question is, is the 1080 worth it over this card? The question you have to ask then is the 1080 has about 10-25 more frames per second compared to this card. However, when this card is running at 100+ frames at 1440p and can run some games at 4k maxed out and can overclock fairly well, you have to ask if its worth it. It might be for some people. It wasn't for me, 650+ is not worth it. You just have to decide for yourself.",09-04-2016,09-04-2016

A DEFECTIVE CARD CAUGHT FIRE AND RUINED MY MOTHERBOARD, POSSIBLY THE REST OF MY MACHINE","As the headline states, a defective card that I received caused a spark which started a small fire in my machine, ruining my motherboard and possibly also ruining every other component connected to the motherboard. I had initially tried plugging in the card in my brand new build, but the computer would not power on with the card installed (although it could without it installed and with another GPU installed). To troubleshoot the problem, I tried installing the card in another machine. That machine caught fire immediately upon turning it on.

I was immediately suspicious upon receiving the card, as the box had already been opened and the manuals, posters, stickers, etc. appeared to be bent up as if the card had been used or refurbished. Since the serial number checked out though, I went ahead and tried installing it. I thought that spending extra money on ""reputable"" hardware would protect me from hassles. Now I need a replacement card and I have to rebuild my other computer.

EDIT: I was issued a full refund by the seller, Amazon.com, LLC for the defective card. However, neither Amazon nor EVGA could help whatsoever with the costs that I had to put out for the replacement of the rest of the machine. I may have been sold a botched refurbished card as new, the card may have been damaged during shipment, or it could have simply been a rare defect. I will never know.

Summary  This is a replacement of my GTX 970 and speed difference as well as rendering is night and day different! I have yet to find anything that this cannot handle.  I would absolutely recommend this card to anyone pondering and this was a perfect install with no issues on my Windows 10 64 Bit O/S. I searched high and low and compared cards until my eyes hurt and this one truly is the best bargain. This is also higher specs than the Founders Edition if you were looking. Founders Edition has only one bios vs. 2 like this card has and this card is over 100mhz slower on clock. Nothing negative to report and this would be a great card to get your system current and give you many years until something else may be needed.

The 10 series seems to have many folks in a frenzy to purchase before they're gone. I've watched prices go up/down and back/forth. Gives me whiplash to watch it all... yikes! Glad I can stop now that I got mine. I was holding out as long as I could to possibly get this GPU with a free game, but since the supply and demand effect is so evident it doesn't make sense. NVIDIA likely won't have a need to push sales with the demand around these cards.

I have owned the Superclocked version of the 1070 and now FTW edition. The SC edition came with White LED's with zero customization. The FTW edition uses RGB LED's and can be customized using the EVGA Precision software. You must have an account, although it be free, with EVGA to get this software and you must have the FTW card to use it. I will say the ability to customize the LED's is pretty slick. It adds absolutely nothing to the performance of the card as its pure cosmetics. That being said, watching your card look like it's breathing as you're playing a scary game is downright chill. The option to choose the LED's to light up with the beat of your audio/music is quite cool too.

The FTW edition does use dual 8-pin power connectors while the SC uses a single 8-pin. I can tell you the performance is not noticeably different after running both cards. The heat generated is identical, but the FTW has slightly higher frame rates (6-8 FPS) due to its slightly higher clock. Again, nothing you'll see by just gaming unless you've got an FPS counter up and running. I personally use FRAPS which tends to be the norm other than Shadowplay. If you're on the fence on which edition to purchase, just watch prices like I did. Got this bad boy for $439.99 which is what the SC card normally goes for. To get the FTW specs at the SC price... I'm down. :)

I purchased this card to get ready for the new BF1 Beta (Likely being released at the end of this month) and the official release in October. I've also played BF4, BO3, Squad, DayZ, ARK and ATS (American Truck Simulator... LOL). This card doesn't break a sweat at 1080p gaming. Everything on all games maxed to the hill. There are some early Alpha games that aren't optimized that well and the card still pulls incredible frames.

I personally believe all computer components are overpriced so if you can get a good deal on this card, it's a no brainer. I haven't heard much whining come from the card although others have mentioned this. Can't wait to see what this card will do with BF1. BF1 FTW! :)",08-15-2016,08-15-2016

After swapping out everything from operating systems, power supplies, memory, hard drives, cpu's, motherboards I'm still suffering with the same issue. Driver wipes help the issue temporarily. I disabled aspect scaling, set the gpu to prefer maximum performance in it's control panel, disabled nvidia shield and reduced the clock a little. Still no luck.

Some drivers work better than others though your mileage may vary. I will say that it worked spectacularly in the first month, however this seems to be an issue plaguing many other users. If I load into a game I can play endlessly but the real problems occur outside of windows. I updated the bios with no effect.

EVGA is a great brand no doubt but it appears that myself and others are having similar issues. Perhaps my unit was faulty although there's speculation over which manufacturer memory was used in its production. Hard artifacting, restarts, blue screens and freezing in windows are all due to an extremely high latency.

This being said, buy the card, if it treats you badly, return it. I'm not in the business of paying shipping to return it as I currently do not reside in the US.

END.

The gpu is pretty great. It's a big upgrade from my GTX970 which treated me well in the short time I had it.

I took a star off because there is some coil whine coming from the unit (which is apparently common). It isn't extremely noticeable but at this price point it really shouldn't have been present. The lighting looks great and even though it isn't RGB it goes with pretty much every theme. The lighting is adjustable eg. breathing, flashing, brightness etc.

If you have an i5 4690k/6600k or equivalent the gpu will be of use to you with minimal bottleneck in most cases. It may not be worth the upgrade if you play at 60fps with a 60hz monitor and already have a capable gpu (gtx 980 or higher).

coil whining noise.

with a 60hz monitor, in windows, i can hear minor noise(you need to stick your ear closely to the card like 10 cm away)

in game on 300FPS,(overwatch,medium setting), i can hear the whining noise in a much faster fasion. ( i sit 1m away from my PC, it is 650D case, with a silence focused build (well only 2 chassis fans and NHD15 for cooling).

i think my setup has too low noise that enable me to hear it? ( i can even hear my 7500RPM hard disk spinning)

Sold build and never buying EVGA again.,"New edit: I never had any heat issues with the card. However, EVGA releasing so many versions and a trade in program to their icx version makes it pretty obvious that there is a serious problem that effects the majority. I would not recommend another EVGA card for that reason. Their customer service is awesome, but clearly their quality control is all kinds of tarded. Anyone who would buy these cards must like the odds of playing lottery. I ended up selling the build and built a itx Fracta Design Define S with an ASUS 1060. I rarely game, so its more on my level, and just an all around nicer card. This sucks, i used to love EVGA. Their new line of PSUs states that there are no interchangeable parts, and they use an odd sized fan. This is just evidence they are trying to make things non replaceable and want to give you the heartache of dealing with them and returning or paying more money for warranties. No thanks. Ill stick to a different brand from now on. Plus, i never really liked the look of the card :(

The new 1080ti looks even fuglier. Its a gpu EVGA, not a space shuttle. Cool your turbo jets and keep it simple.

EDIT: I swapped my SC for a 1070 FTW. MUCH BETTER!
stable at 2100 flat! Don't even need slave bios to notice better settings. pics will follow soon.

This is my first build and I am able to play on highest/ultra with 60fps. Temps are amazing. OC to just barely over 2GHz and it's perfect. I play at 2560x1080 currently. If you are on 1080p, No doubt this card will annihilate your games. If you are on 1440p, maybe wait for the 1080ti because even the 1080 struggles with that and for 'future proofing' - if there is such a thing (there isnt!) you would be wise to wait a while longer. As for 4k, probably not going to enjoy this card at all.

Temps are great. Under load in ""The Division"" and ""GTA V"" I get 60fps with some fine tuning the temps never get above 65. Idle temps are great too around 27-35 depending on room temperature. I use MSI Afterburner (after using buggy Precision X and only getting problems) for the fans (since the default fan temps are outrageous and do not even kick on until 50 degrees) and to lock the clock speed in during gaming. Also, make sure you go into Nvidia control panel and change the optimal power mode, to maximum performance. It dies throttle a bit from 2.03-2.06. It has been stable like that for extended periods. Some people are benchmarking just for the scores and have to constantly adjust for each one. This is a stable clock for everything. You can use the NCP optimal power under global settings, and choose specific programs to alter settings on. That is the best bet to ensure when you are not gaming, you are not idling the gpu at full clock or using unnecessary amounts of power.

I did a lot of tweaking and have finally found the prefect set up for my use. Gaming, HTPC, Browsing, School, etc etc.... Pretty much everything I will ever need from a GPU. This is my command center and it runs well. I wanted to leave a positive review for what this card is, but I would still advise you to wait longer and just get a 1080 or better. These card manufacturer's are holding back and playing the marketing game to squeeze every penny (not private sellers, the actual manufacturer's) and I believe this card has a lot more potential than they are giving it, especially for the price. If you can, save a little more and spring for the 1080 once prices drop or if you already have a 9 series or even something older, just wait for the ti versions or whatever comes next to last you just as long as your old card did. If you have your heart set on a 1070 regardless, wait for the FTW versions. They should overclock a bit nicer, hopefully to at least 2.1GHz.

UPDATEL it appears the FTW cards do not overclock any better according to EVGA's forums. Since the new driver came out I downloaded it and have not noticed any fluctuation of clock speed during play since. It starts out a bit high then drops to a solid 2063-2068. Even with the slave bios most FTW's I have seen still only get about 2088 stable. It's still pretty good considering the stock clock, but there is more potential than they are giving us, especially in the $400 range. At this rate, the prices will only continue to go up.",07-07-2016,07-07-2016

I've been able to get stable 2000 Core (Boost) and 4000 Memory.  Temps idle around 33 with no fan (same as 780 with full fan) and haven't gone past 65 under load (Witcher 3, Metro 2033).

Everything is able to run ULTRA at 1080p 60fps and the extra RAM is usable by my Adobe apps (which in theory should help somewhat).

The ACX 3.0 cooling is efficient and quiet, which may not be as important as it was for the 780 I had (reference cooler) it would hit 96-99 on some games where this chip runs cool to begin with.

The new EVGA Precision OC tool made for Pascal is better (for me).  It clocks easy, OSD works unlike the older one and just seems a little more stable.

I was tempted to pick up a 1080, but figured I'd wait for the Ti and I'm glad I did, this runs everything i throw at well enough and in six months the Ti will likely be out.  Pretty sure this won't last the 3 years my 780 did with the way VR and Unreal 4 engine games are looking, but at least the price is tolerable (actual retail not the inflated nonsense going on here and other stores)

has a lot of hype surrounding it, does it live up to the hype?  To jump straight to the answer, it's yes and no.  The card itself is very well built, the design is sleek and modern.  Love or hate it, it does use the blower style cooler.  I personally have no problem with this cooling method as my case is well insulated and a good distance away from my sitting area since the PC is part of my entertainment center.  The noise from the blower is not that noticeable at high load, I am coming from an Asus GTX 970 Strix OC which ran way louder.  Coil whine was not present at the time of my benchmarks, or if it was, it was very minimal.  The only thing about the presentation that I wasn't the biggest fan of was the green LED for the ""GTX 1070"" lettering, I wish there was built in software to change the color of the LED to match with my color scheme.

Performance wise the card is a beast.  Straight out of the box I tested some major AAA titles and did a FireStrike benchmark, the results did not disappoint, without overclocking at all the card surpassed expectations and chewed up anything I threw at it.  Here are the specs of my build:

Intel i5 6600k 3.5ghz
16gb Corsair Vengence DDR4 2400
Gigabyte z170 Motherboard
EVGA GTX 1070 FE
Corsair Hydro H60
Corsair CX 750M Power Supply
Bit Fenix Mini-ITX BFC Pro-300
Samsung 850 EVO - 250gb SSD

(All clocks were at base for testing, no OC present)

FireStrike capped out at 13,983 out of three runs, this was the best.

I tested it on the following games in 1080p with every setting I could possibly max out:

Doom (2016) - Peak 212 FPS, Average 121
Lords of the Fallen - Peak 130, Average 82
Rise of the Tomb Raider - Peak 124, Average 68
The Witcher III - Peak 132, Average 63

The idle temperature never exceeded 42C, at full load I would top out around 54C.

The card is wonderful for 1080p gaming, but I have mixed feelings about the 4k options, I do not have a 4k setup and do not want to invest in a monitor for it due to high costs, the performance is just middle of the road and doesn't to make sense to jump in just yet on a single card.

Final thoughts, the GTX 1070 is a nice jump from the Strix 970, however, the performance jump was not as shocking as a jump from a few generations ago.  The price is a little hard to swallow for the FE, but I really do like the design and did not want to wait for the after market cards.  Once a good after market that is sub $400 comes out, I will pick that up and move this one into my PC in another office.  I think overall the card is a solid 4/5.  It would have been a solid 5 if the LEDs could be changed via software and if the FE were not priced higher than the standard 970.

The reviews on Amazon do not accurately reflect the feelings of people who have legitimately purchased these due to resellers marking up the prices.  It's not a fair representation of the actual product, but this is the only way people can vent their frustrations about the reseller problem that plagues Amazon.  Amazon definitely needs to make it more clear that the listed price when a reseller is selling it is NOT from Amazon directly and differentiate their listing from third party.  The people who buy from these resllers are equally to blame.  Stop buying from them and they will go away, end of story.  The only reason to ever buy from a reseller is if it's preowned and it's cheaper than MSRP.

Sorry for the rant, but enjoy your new card, hope the review helps.  I'm pleased with my purchase and can't wait to see games like Battlefield 1 running on it in the near future.",07-01-2016,07-01-2016

For sure, this is going to sell well anyways since it's made by Nvidia. However, there are multiple green traps that you can fall into this card, so you might as well buy from the red lava company, known as AMD!

The Nvidia 1070 is considered to be one of the fastest cards to date, and it shows in it's strong 1080p gaming. You can obviously so 1080p gaming at max settings at 60+ FPS. 1440p isn't that horrible either, at around 60 FPS on medium to high settings.

So, if all of the 1070 is good, then why is it only 2 stars in my book?

First things is, the rise of 4K gaming is one the rise, and more gamers are gaming on 4K televisions that have HDR compatibility. However, the 1070 doesn't quite have that horsepower to meet the demand of 4K gaming on televisions. Also, the 1070 hasn't been polished on the Dx12 side, which is what happened to the 970. It just seems like that Nvidia just doesn't know that DX12 is extremely popular. The 1070's Dx12 performance is quite similar to the R9 390X's performance in Dx12.

So far, I am not quite impressed with this card. It just feels like Nvidia completely just wanted to get this on the shelf as soon as possible just to make some thousands of dollars. No wonder the price is currently $450, when the 1070 could be easily improved if Nvidia waited a little longer.",06-29-2016,06-29-2016

For now, I would definitely hold off because this card is excellent at 1080 but struggles with anything at 4k, like a youtube reviewer had commented already, this is a 1440p card that is way overpriced, period; its in between 1440 and 4k, not fully capable and therefore is good but at a $300 with tax price, very reasonable, not $500, just does not do anything really amazing for what the asking price is. OF COURSE it runs all games max, but not at 4k, and thats just the standard for this price range, i believe it to be.
SO, AMD we await for your offering hoping the technology satisfies the price, and thats really what its all about cause a playstation 4 is better justified than a graphics card for 4k gaming on a tv, there are definitely issues with latency when gaming on 4k tv's with a computer; my two cents.
note:, 4k displays upscale 1080p games pretty decent. example, witcher 3 on ps4",06-17-2016,06-17-2016

THIS CARD WILL DROP SIGNIFICANTLY IN PRICE POINT AFTER 10-15 DAYS!

Ladies and Gentlemen of Amazon, these cards are released on June 10, 2016 at a $449 price point for an early release ""founders edition""

The ""HYPE"" is real! It is an amazing card, hence the 5 stars, it's faster than the Titan X... HOWEVER!!! READ ON!!!

This is the first time NVIDIA will be competing against partners like EVGA to sell the card directly.

This means their cooler design with the ""Vapor chamber"" that they try to upsell you to the $449 Founders edition for IS NOT WORTH IT EITHER!

PLEASE WAIT UNTIL THIS CARD DROPS TO THE REASONABLE $349 MSRP THAT IT SHOULD BE!

On a side note,

THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE IN ANY MATERIAL OR DESIGN USED, BETWEEN THE FOUNDERS EDITION CARDS, AND THE REGULAR CARDS SHIPPED SHORTLY AFTERWARD.

The Founder's edition is another way of saying Reference Card and another way to charge those who want the card on the very first day, an extra 100 bucks.

Partners like EVGA will come out with Custom Cards with liquid cooling and so forth, for around the same price point.

These cards will come factory overclocked and superclocked, and will have different types like the ""Kingpin"" edition which uses premium copper for heat dissipation on the 980 Ti

Please wait, be patient for 14 days, and then order a custom card from NVIDIA partners.

That is my best advice to you Amazonians.

It makes me want to leave them positive seller feedback without changing anything regarding the product. They make the product and are trying to back it up and that may be worth changing 3 stars on the product to 4 stars. Sort of makes me feel like I'm playing into the gaming of reviews but at the same time this is them backing up their product which means a lot.

A value at 10 bucks and a bargain at 8. I paid 17.

Basically two pieces of metal with a hinge holding them together for 17 bucks. It doesn't lock into place. With only one hinge you are stuck at the one height and a way to change the viewing angle. It is too big for my phone and too small for my tablet. It works for both mostly. You see a half inch of the stand on either side of the phone and it is shaky with the tablet because the base is too small especially if you have to tap even lightly on one of the upper corners.

It is certainly not junk and it I like it more than the 5 dollar stand I bought at the same time that doesn't elevate the holding position above the table. It makes it so that I can plug it in portrait mode which is great. In spite of not locking into position the hinge is sturdy enough to hold up to everything but playing games. Playing games on the tablet with the narrow base is out of the question anyway. No big deal there.

Probably sounds like negative criticism but it is a cheap metal stand for 17 bucks and I find it a poor value. They probably have good customer service. Their marketing team is aggressive so you'll get an email asking for a review and you'll find them addressing concerns in the comments on other reviews. Good marketing is how companies game the reviews on Amazon.

That is my 2 cents. A value at 10 bucks and a bargain at 8.",08-02-2018,08-02-2018

Youre probably looking at this stand because it had some of the highest ratings while also being relatively inexpensive. I did too, which is why I bought the stand for my iPad Mini 4. It arrived within two days and was packaged well. The stand looked fine (see pictures below) except for one barely noticeable scuff mark on the upper-back of the neck. Although initially disappointed, I remembered only paying $15.99.

Made from brushed aluminum, the stand comes with several additional replacement rubber feet (see pictures below). The hinge is solid and is flexible enough while maintaining its structure as to not fail under the weight of a device.

Maybe my expectations were too high due to the insanely high ratings. The basic, simple stand I received is slightly bent and leans enough to the left that it is impossible not to notice. It is relatively strong and is not without its merit in terms of providing a simple very basic stand for your tablet or iPad. It does its job pretty well and no more.

I'm leaving my original review up but amending a few things.

First and most important is how impressed I am with Lamicall customer service. Shortly after reviewing the product which I don't feel was overly critical I was contacted by Lamicall and offered a full refund without returning the stand. I did not ask for anything much less such a generous offer. I never contacted them and aside from the lean in the stand had no reason or issue to warrant contacting them. I feel like this is far above and beyond the norm and very much worth mentioning.

2nd thing is being a bit unhappy with a bent or leaning stand I did not focus much on the positive aspects of this product. After the refund I figured I had nothing to lose and put some serious weight into trying to bend the stand back into position. It worked, not perfectly but good enough to use. The fact that it took the force I applied and is now still functional speaks volumes to the durability of the stand. It retained its ability to be adjustable and remain strong in holding any position. I like this stand quite a bit. Plenty of room for my iPad regardless of if its wearing a fat otterbox case or a slim folio case and is always securely able to hold the iPad in place. Overall for my needs and expectations it's an awesome stand.",03-26-2018,03-26-2018

Particularly, I put a Velcro dot on so I can even tilt it over vertical.
I probably would have contrapted something like this out of popsicle sticks eventually, but this cost less than those couple of hours, and the dot keeps it from falling, so, happy happy!

I've used it a number of times already, with the iPad Pro 10.5"" in both vertical and horizontal positions, and am definitely pleased with the stability.  The question is how long any of these stands maintain their ability to hold a position, which could be a problem with the iPad being held vertically.

What I particularly like is that (1) it's substantial -- I have a few iPad stands and while they're nice, they're a bit light and thus easy for a clumsy oaf like me to knock over. Even better is the ability to choose virtually any angle of tilt.

Only four stars because according to the manufacturer -- they emailed me -- it scratches up iPad Pros now and then.  I've not yet had the problem but it would have been nice to have a ""MAYBE DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A PRO"" notation in big letters.",12-12-2017,12-12-2017

I have added a star for the prompt and courteous customer service alone. That is rare in today's digital commerce environment.

Here is my original review, which I stand by, but I am looking forward eagerly to a larger Lamicall Tablet Stand and will buy it without hesitation.

I wanted this stand to be awesome. When it arrived I was impressed with the build quality, etc. But when I put my behemoth iPad Pro 12.9"" on it, it toppled backwards. So, here are my current options: 1. Stand the iPad almost vertically. 2. Use my iPad in landscape view only. 3. Weigh down the base or put double sided tape on the bottom. It appears that with just a little more ""practical experimentation"" they could have designed this slightly differently and accommodated the iPad Pro perfectly. Don't get me wrong, every other tablet I have fits solidly on it.",09-12-2017,09-12-2017

It was really great at first, but then as I used it more heavily, I began to notice various problems.

One is that the upper rubber pads are sliding down and just will not stay up. It leaves it looking rather poorly as the adhesive is sliding down and is somewhat unsightly.  I suppose the real problem here is that they misadvertised the color of the pads. In the photos they provide above, they appear black / dark grey whereas in reality they are clear with white adhesive under them. If they had provided black pads with black adhesive, this would never have been a problem or at least not a visually pronounced problem.  I still don't like them riding over the rotating joint though as I feel they're going to cause problems there as well at some point.

Another problem is that the base is not quite heavy or wide enough and so when you sit the iPad into the base it moves around a bit and requires the iPad to be nearly centered in order to not fall over.

Just a little more thought and testing would make this just about perfect.",09-02-2017,09-02-2017

Here's why:  I have a 12.9"" iPad Pro.  Got this to set the tablet at just the right angle for typing, reading and diagramming. For any other tablet, this stand would work great. But with the size and the weight of the Pro, tapping on the screen produces a giggle in the stand that takes a while to go away, even after you stop touching the tablet. The stand is just too ""springy"". As an engineer, I can tell you that if the aluminum base was thicker, this would not be an issue.  The rest of the stand is built stoutly. The angle adjustment is firm, smooth and infinite. With a Pro, I would also be a more comfortable with a little wider base - just a little more side stability with a big tablet. I really hated returning this but it just didn't work out for my tablet.  If you have an Air, Mini, smaller Galaxy, etc. I would highly recommend this stand.  If the manufacturer comes out with a similar stand that fits the 12.9"" iPad better, I'll buy it in a heartbeat! Also, kudos to the seller and Amazon for a smooth return.",08-03-2017,08-03-2017

It's quite pleasant to manipulate to different angles. It holds the adjustments too. Ergonomically, it's a nice height for viewing and using your device. I've also found it to be very nice with an external Bluetooth keyboard, it feels like a proper writing setup. Aesthetically, it looks very slick. The angle and design of the base is reminiscent of an iMac's stand. In fact, it looks sharp next to my iMac.

It's adjustable from nearly 3 degrees up to 45 degrees so it's very ergonomic.  Please let me know if you found this review helpful!",07-03-2017,07-03-2017

The stand is very nice looking and looks very ""Apple"" in style.  From my perspective it is very sturdy and solid in construction.

The foot has 4 rubber pads on it to give very good traction between the stand and your desk.  If you intend on swiveling it left to right then the traction on a smooth surface desk (like a glass desk) may be more then you expect.  I personally love it because I do not want my iPad sliding around while I am swiping and tapping things on the screen.

The only (and this is small) reason why I removed 1 star was on the claw part of the stand.  The place where the bottom of your iPad comes in contact with the swivel part of the stand.  In that area there is a rubber pad on each side to protect your iPad but it does not extend over the edge so you could (if not reasonably careful) scratch your bezel.  It would be nicer if the padding extended a bit higher on the ""claw"".  The risk is low if you take care when seating your iPad but not zero.  Hopefully the designer of this will improve this very small point to get to 5 stars.  Once in place, your iPad will be safe and secure.

Even with the knowledge I have, I would buy another one because it does a very nice job and meets all my needs.",06-24-2017,06-24-2017

I received the product today and as soon as I opened it I was so disappointed by the rubbers. ITS WHITE. It seriously distorts the slick black color with trash white rubber pads. When I first saw the pictures on amazon, I thought they were stickers covering the actual 'black' rubbers, but they are not. It is exactly like the picture, but even worse in person. The entire stand feels solid and seems like its made of high quality but the color of these rubbers seriously diminishes the value. It looks terrible... terrible... If i had known earlier, i would of never purchased this product. What a waste of 'great' stand.  (It also looks terrible on my desk.)

UPDATE///  After I left a review, Lamicall instantly responded by offering help. They were very open to customer criticisms and were willing to fix their design to better suit their customers. What a wonderful mindset for a company to have... They did everything they can to fix my issue. Also, my only gripe was the white rubber on black stand. However, after couple uses, my iPad stays solid on the stand. It doesn't wobble at all. It's very firm and reliable. I would have to use this stand for a bit more to leave a thorough review, but for now its perfect (other than the white color of the rubber).  If they do listen and change the color, i would definitely purchase more for my family. For the perfect customer service and their almost flawless stand I've updated my review to 4 stars.",06-20-2017,06-20-2017

  It arrived in perfect order in in uniquely shaped box. It had very little documentation with it, but do you really need it?
  I, like many other reviewers here, was concerned with the strength of the hinge and would it hold a 10 inch tablet securely enough that I could still find it useful. I can assure you, this is one extremely sturdy stand. It hold my tablet wonderfully as you can see from the pictures I am including. It will hold my tablet in portrait or landscape orientation. The hinge is very secure and it's hard to describe, its ease of movement is perfectly counterbalanced with its ease that it won't move. I don't think I will have any problems with this stand.
  If your tablet or phone has a port on the bottom the stand will accommodate that as well.

Pros:  It matches with your Apple gear and has a modern look.  Good if you need it to just watch videos or have a minimal need to tap on the tablet.

Cons:  It didn't meet what I was looking for in a stand.  Specifically, I'm using a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and wanted something to hold it in portrait mode as I used the Surface Pen to take notes.  Two issues are why this is not a good solution.  1.  The stand itself is not study enough to hold the tablet for you to write on or even tap on.  It wobbles when you do this.  2.  The stand will hold the Surface 4 Pro with the keyboard cover but it does not go in the holder very well.  I eventually purchased a wooden book stand.  Although its larger, it is much more solid and fits my needs better.

Still loving it. Well built, sturdy, easy to use, easy to move to another room. Holds the IPad Mini at the perfect height, love the adjustability in viewing angle.  A great example of a cost effective solution to a problem. The silver color and design also fit well in my d&eacute;cor.

I checked items and read hundreds of reviews before deciding to purchase this tablet stand.  Just wanted to let you know in an update that all is well and working as expected.  I expect the stand to last for many more years. Great brand at a great price.

This card does get recognized and I can use it well.

Old Review:
My iPad 2 broke and I was looking to buy an (a second one in the household) ipad air; got this at the right time, and am in tablet heaven...
I did try a Dell Venue 8"" - my first android tab - a while ago and it was a disaster (turns out there are display and hardware issues with that model). So when I got this, I was a bit skeptical - only for the first 10 minutes, though!
Let us get to details then...
Summary of differences with ipad:
1. MicroSD slot! (up to 128Gb capacity)
2. Better and bigger display
3. 3GB memory for running applications (compared to 1GB)
4. Camera 8MP compared to 5MP
5. Fingerprint sensor!

Size and handling: At 10.5, it is bigger than ipad air. Even thinner than iPad at 0.26 inches; smooth surfaces, and as with iPad Air, it is a bad idea to handle this beauty without a case; it is quite easy to drop these, and they are not made to hold in hand for long hours without a cover, either. So, please buy a good cover to go with this.

Display: At 2560x1600 it is about 25+% more than iPad air in terms of resolution (287ppi compared to 264ppi) - and it shows! Beautiful Super AMOLED display beats out the LED displays. It is reported that AMOLED displays are usually not bright enough, but on this model, it is more than enough - even in bright outdoors. The settings entry for brightness has an 'auto' mode, but that doesn't seem to work fully well (an android issue or Samsung issue), and it is still bright in the night. I had to turn off auto and reduce the brightness manuallly for night time viewing! The display is gorgeous, to say the least, and the best part of this tablet.

Battery and charging: Battery life is quite adequate at about 8+ hours ( I did run through several episodes of burn notice with netflix streaming on one charge). Charging with the included charger does take longer than I expected - several hours for full charge. In addition, there is ultra power saving mode you can turn on from 'settings -> General' menu - this mode takes you to a black and white screen mode and allows basic web surfing, email and a few application that you can choose to add.  In this mode, it can last quite a few hours with just 10% charge remaining.

Bloatware: Contrary to some review, there is some bloatware that is pre-installed but not much. There are two boxes that show up in the second screen - Galaxy essentials and galaxy gifts. If you go in to this, you get to choose what bloatware you want :) But there are some good ones such as wall street journal or Economist 3 month subscriptions for free, GQ and other free issues, as well as some free games.
There are 2 apps - Samsung Level (for the soon-to-be-released Samsung headphones - to compete with Beats..) and Samsung Gear - pre-installed.

Camera: 8MP for the back camera with a flash compared to just 5 MP in iPad - seems good. But this is the only feature that was ordinary in Samsung tablet. The pictures in auto mode doesn't look as good as a normal (cheapo) 8MP digital camera photos in auto mode - even to an untrained eye. (I put a Canon EOS 7D to good use and I can spot a good camera when I see one; sadly this is not one of those..), but it is adequate; so is the front camera at 2 MP.

WIFI - comparable; both support a/b/g/n dual band MIMO, but Samsung also supports 'ac'. Quite easy to setup/connect to home networks. So far there is not one hiccup with the wireless access. Excellent performance.

CPU - While iPad only has A7 ARM cores, Samsung has 4 A7 cores and 4 A15 cores; it claims it switches the cores depending on the need/usage/power requirements. For all practical purposes, it is fast; there is some lag but not serious lag in using multiple apps and notifications and background tasks going on.

Fingerprint sensor: It is all how you train (give samples) the sensor! It takes 8 samples to setup, and so use your finger in slightly different angles - tilting your finger a little from left to right before each sample. Settings screen and fingerprint setup also allows you to setup an alternate password in case you can't get through with your fingerprint. In addition you can always unlock with your google account. I am able to use the finger sensor almost without any failure so far and found this this to be way better than the one I have on my Dell Lattitude notebooks.

Audio: has 2 speakers one on each side (unlike ipad air), and the audio is decent for this price, though I prefer to use earbuds for better sound.

Watch On app and the IR capability: while new for Samsung, the app is still not ready; has several issues. It let me add my Denon receiver, dish receiver, sony bluray and panasonic tv etc., but I can't turn off or control all devices individually (no selection for device). Only volume, channel change etc work! Power button asks what device you want to power off - again didn't list bluray or receiver - only my TV and Dish. I hope this will get fixed as the app improves. But basic IR facility is great - worked from a distance of 20+ ft across the room.

I absolutely love this. In terms of hardware, it scores a 10/10; fit and finish is great and I would expect this to last at least another 6 to 8 years (unless the technology obsoletes this hardware - which it will...); Apple has been trounced from the tablet throne with this entry.",06-28-2014,06-28-2014

I or my wife own I pads and Kindle HD and a galaxy tab pro and nothing beats the pleasure of watching movies on this (for a tablet-not that 60 inch curved tv at Magnolia). There is detail and depth and color. I use any content apps I want- Hulu, Netflix, Xfinity, it looks fantastic.  Amazon prime music app now let's you listen and download for offline listening if you have prime. I don't believe that prime video is supported on this device or any Android tablet. Not through a nonexistent app or the Chrome browser.
  The micro SD slot is important to me if I'm looking at photos I take with a separate camera and don't wish to use a computer to put them onto the cloud just to see them or jump through other hoops  or hurdles to look at my content.

  Speaking of pictures I worried that this display would over saturate the ones I took and give me a false representation or candy colors. I like to see how I'm doing on a larger screen and take a tablet along with me frequently and Samsung uses an adaptive display for your various content that tones things down depending on what your doing.  My photos look pretty  natural, but  very detailed.  I love this thing for a lot of reasons. There are plenty of things to customize and make your own.

I had the very 1st generation iPad, but other than that I've never had a tablet before.

The first thing you notice when you turn on the tablet and play the sample video clip that comes on the tablet is how astonishing the screen brightness and clarity is! The video is so crisp and clear.  I was going to buy the Note 10.1 refurbished model because it was hundreds cheaper, but when I found out this tablet is Super Amoled display and all the tech sites said this is the best tablet on the market right now, I decided to fork up the extra money and get it. I'm sure glad I did!

I showed my friend at work who has an iPad, and the first thing he said ""that blows my iPad out of the water!""

The finger scanner works flawlessly! The tablet asks you to scan your finger 8 times, and I've never had it fail me once and I've unlocked the screen 30+ times today.

The bezel around the screen is the smallest we've seen yet in a tablet and I love it! For instance, if you compare this tablet to the Nexus 10, the Nexus 10 looks so outdated because of the THICK bezel going around the edge of the tablet. You do NOT get that unappealing look with this tablet. This tablet is the sexiest one on the market right now!

https://www.amazon.com/Tablet-Stand-Adjustable-Lamicall-Reader/dp/B01DBV1OKY?th=1,33,Electronics,"Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5-Inch Tablet (16 GB, Titanium Bronze)",4.5,4,Direct Apple Competition?,"Let's review the specs.  For $500 you get a 10.5 inch screen, ultra thin body with high resolution screen, a stated 9 hour battery runtime, around 10 ounces in weight and 3GB RAM.

The new iPad?  Nope, it's the new entry from Samsung, the Galaxy Tab S 10.5.

But let's be realistic -- it's designed to compete with the iPad in an attempt to topple the latter from its throne so comparisons must be made in that respect.

As compared to the iPad Air, this unit has a slightly larger screen and maybe weighs a bit more, but otherwise they are nearly identical in these areas.  Both also sport robust construction although a few I know that compared this to the iPad state the Apple version has the sleek aluminum structure; however, there is no faulting the Samsung.

Unfortunately, both do share a similar trait -- forgo a case and you also forgo grip.  Both are so light and thin they are literally a drop accident waiting to happen.

And while both tip the financial scales at identical pricing, the Samsung has a few upgrades.  First, you get 3GB RAM instead of the usual 1 for the iPad, then you'll notice the rear camera has a flash and an 8MP rating as opposed to the lower resolution iPad version (with no flash), and, finally, you get a micro-SD card slot (something Apple has been ignoring for years).

However, it's the screen that will amaze.  AMOLED technology means colors are bright and blacks are, well, eerily black (almost new car, shiny black).  This is quite a contrast from the iPad's more sedate screen, although both are still amazing considering the technology from the earlier tablets, but the truth remains that side-by-side, the Samsung's screen really stands out.

In fact, after a short while I had to tone down the brightness some as this unit will actually light up a room.  Nighttime discreet is not in the cards here.

Performance-wise the Samsung gets the newer Android 4.4 OS which has a bevy of improvements over previous versions, too many to mention here.  Let it suffice to say that speed is not a problem here and I enjoy the interface over iOS versions which don't allow main screen widgets and much in the way of related animations.  In short, if you desire an OS that allows for streaming news and interactive widgets, this is the puppy for you.

However, there are some quirks here.  Android allows for folders to be created on the screen to house multiple apps and this is done by either moving apps on top of each other (ala' Apple) which creates a new folder or by holding a finger on the screen to bring up a submenu to create a folder; however, Samsung tweaked this procedure and has made it so the only way to create desktop folders is by holding an icon until a menu appears on top of the screen and then scooting the icon to that area to create a folder.  Time consuming and somewhat unnecessary.

Samsung added one perk to the mix, though -- a fingerprint scanner.  Swipe your fingerprint at the center bottom of the screen when prompted and it'll open the  OS as if you entered a password (word of caution -- remember the password in case your finger doesn't pass muster).  Although initially impressed, it some became apparent it had about a 40% success rate and is not for the impatient since it requires a slow, methodical swiping of the finger.

Sound reproduction is an ongoing problem with any tablet unless you opt for the headphones but Samsung hit it here.  Sound reproduction is great.

Performance, unfortunately, does come at a cost, though.  Although rated at 9 hours of battery life (down from an original estimate by some of closer to 11), those ignoring the battery saver functions built in will find themselves seeking an outlet at closer to 7, as in my case.  To be fair, I was running videos and jumping all over the internet so your mileage may vary.  For those that sometimes ignore the battery warnings, there is a power mode that turns the screen from color to B&W and shuts down all but the essential apps.  Hopefully you don't have to use this mode much since you're getting down to the critical stage by that time but you can technically turn it on any time.

On that power topic, I really couldn't find much that would cause this unit to lock up or slow down.  Even higher end, memory eating, games didn't seem to bother it much nor did forgetting to shut down the last 15 apps I opened while hammering away at another.  Guess that 3GB RAM does help a lot.

So, are there any downsides here?  As with any tablet, including the vaunted iPad, there are faults:

* Price is steep and encroaches on Apple territory.  Given the option of the Apple or Samsung at the same price, the vast majority chose the former.

* Accessories?  What accessories? Few companies are producing cases and the like at this time and you can easily dump anywhere from $40 on up at Samsung's site to get cases which, oddly enough, seem to be lagging behind the release date of the tablet itself (although I may has misread that).  Because of the odd screen size (larger than the industry standard of 10.1"") you chance of making one of these fit into a generic tablet holder is about nil.

* No 4G (or 3G for that matter) yet and capable models will not be out until later this year.  Oops, that's a biggie.

* 16GB for main memory?  Really?  Yes, the Samsung does have a card slot that can accept up to 128GB, but not everything transfers to these cards (especially some apps) and transfer rates from these cards are still slower than the included drive.  Offer options here, folks.

* Bloatware galore, and gimmicky stuff at that.  Fortunately, most of it just sits there and does nothing until you command differently; however, I was hoping those days were gone when tablets came out.  Problem is, some of that 16GB onboard is occupied with this stuff but I do have to commend Samsung for leaving what appears to be the majority on their website for download if desired.

And, finally, there is the processor.  Instead of opting for the Intel Atom tablet series, Samsung opted to stay with the newest Enyxos quadcore version.  While wholly capable and probably just as appropriate as the Atom, the Intel name does carry cache over what was chosen.

However, all things considered, Samsung could have a hit here, especially with those users not quite accustomed to Apple's version of ""take it or leave it"" iOS and lack of SD card support.  For the same price as a base Apple unit, Samsung buyers get more RAM, an SD card reader, the Android OS, and cameras with flash and better MP ratings.

Update:  There have been a couple pesky little items that have cropped up that don't necessarily merit a drop in rating but should be kept in mind:

*  The charger is just as bad as the old Apple iPad pre-Lightning version; however, it's even smaller and more fragile.  Mine is already starting to show signs of fatigue and there's no way of gingerly putting one in.  I can see this as an accident waiting to happen.

*  Email notification is nothing short of lacking.  I have it on push yet this model is always behind my Apple  by at least a good couple minutes.  In addition, I'll delete an email only to have it suddenly reappear in my inbox.  Hmmm, something isn't right here.  Had to finally ignore the installed Samsung app and put in another.",06-26-2014,06-26-2014

I bought Samsung Galaxy Tab S SM-T800 32GB, Wi-Fi, 10.5in  Titanium Bronze, used but in mint condition. The battery was replaced recently and it works like brand new. I installed a 128GM SD Card and realized it was almost useless if you don know how.
First the USB C power plug is a weak, point and many people replaced it and the circuit, by opening the tablet.
So the first thing I installed a right leg USB C male to USB A female, and I plug the power, or USB memory stick at USB A female. If anything goes wrong I have to replace this $7 adaptor without touching the tablet.
Second - The volume of tablet is low, but I accept and understand why. Samsung is able to put 3 WAT Speakers, but this will drain the battery in 2 hours.
so for personal use I bought a ""Edifier H180 Hi-Fi Stereo Earbuds Headphone - Classic Earbud Style Headphones - Black"" for about $13.
If 2 or more people need to listen I bought a ""TIVDIO L-218 Portable AM/FM Transistor Radio with Mp3 Music Player Speaker Support Micro IF Card (Gold)"" for about $13 ( with very clear sound).
You can stream at TV in your home too. So the volume isn't an ISSUE if you KNO HOW.
Regarding the software, unfortunately there are limitations, and to overcome them it is beyond of general Public.
To give step by step everything I have to Write A 100 pages book but here are some tips.
To use efficiently all 128GB external memory it was easy to say, but hard to accomplish.
It isn't so simple because:
App Manager III works much better if your tablet is rooted. I was finally able to root my Samsung tablet after many...  many attempts. Anyone who says rooting your tablet is a piece of cake then is not a beginner. You have to have some experience. Experience is gained by failing. I was worried about bricking my tablet.
So after rooting my tablet the first thing I did is Grant app manager III Super user access, which you can only Grant if you have rooted your tablet.
And this is the first step, but you have to make more steps to be able to use efficiently the 128GB SD CARD storage.
But did you got AOSP (Android Open Source Project) 6.0.1 ROM, as I did on my SM-T800, and that let's you format your micro SD card as internal storage.
oh there are more things to do, and unfortunately, Samsung doesn't provide you much detailed information.
If you are using a 128GB SD Card, as Ii do, did you partitioned your SD Card?
You backup your files to the pc. After you have partitioned your SD Card, put the files back on it. When you insert the card back in it will ask you which script, ext. 2, 3 ,4 etc.. Then you can link apps to the system partitions.
oh did you installed link2sd?
The potential is as big, as the time and pain, to make it working properly.",03-03-2018,03-03-2018

For the near $500 price tag of a brand new Galaxy Tab S, you can find a better device to suit your needs. That being said, this is a great choice for anyone who is not a power user. I am a college student who simply wanted a lightweight device for media consumption and productivity purposes, and this device suits my needs very well.

The device is decently fast, although there can be some noticeable sluggishness at times. I have never been a fan of the Samsung user experience, and my distaste is reinforced in this device. I opted to use Nova Launcher over Samsung's Touchwiz skin in order to obtain a cleaner user experience. Touchwiz is a notoriously heavy Android skin, and this device is riddled with Samsung ""improvements"" (which include a variety of Samsung apps that cannot be disabled, which is slightly irritating).

There are many good things to say about this tablet as well. Samsung makes some of the most amazing screens for mobile devices, and this one is no exception. It is incredibly bright, crisp, and vibrant. In addition the tablet is fantastically sleek. Even with a keyboard case attached, the combined thickness that of your average magazine. The tablet feels premium in its build, and features such as the fingerprint sensor make the user experience much more enjoyable.

All other things aside, this tablet has become my daily driver. I would highly recommend this product for a casual user who is looking for a partner for their laptop, or simply a larger screen than their phone to watch Netflix.",09-09-2017,09-09-2017

My one-star rating evaluates the overall product experience:  purchase, use and reliability.  The irony?  The tablet is the best I've seen.  There aren't enough adjectives.  Clear, bright, versatile, flexible, long battery life, and stylish.

The worst part of my wife's tablet became clear when the device wouldn't charge fully to 100% in less than 36 hours after about 150 charges, a relatively short use of battery.  I purchased this for my her and ignored her when she complained about long charge times after just three months of use.  After the warranty expired, and she kept complaining the charges were taking longer, I ran tests to isolate the problem to the device and not the charging cord or the AC wall adapter.  After days-long charging attempts, I finally resigned myself to the fact either the charging port, battery or motherboard was defective and made contact with Samsung for repair.  That experience earned half the bad rating.  If you have a tablet and it develops a problem needing repair, It may be instructive for me to explain the morass of dealing with Samsung repairs.

First, the repair center is a Samsung contractor, CVE, and it has a firewall from customer contact through use of :""call centers"".  These folks know nothing about electronics and interface with customers to begin the administrative steps to get the device sent to the repair center.  A repair ticket number is assigned and emailed to you, but expires in 14-days.  A label is sent to you for UPS to return the device, and in my case, the call  center rep said it was pre-paid, but in fact, UPS charged me for the pickup.  After receiving the repair center device, I received an email stating ""no defects found"".  Mind you, this after I took a week to troubleshoot every variable.  Changing cable connections, replacing adapters, etc. I even did a factory reset with Samsung embedded apps only.  Still charged in no less than 20-24 hours. I replied to the email by asking them to describe troubleshooting methods and if the adapter and charging cord supplied were tested with the device to replicate exactly what I had experienced for a week of troubleshooting prior to shipping, and my wife had been experiencing for a year or more. I asked iof they read my bulletized list of problems I experienced in my tests, with my phone number added. No response.

So, I called the number listed for the repair center online only to get..a call center rep.  She couldn't explain why I was told no defect was found.  I asked what the status was now.  She looked at her computer screen and said, ""it has been submitted for re-evaluation"".  That would have only happened if I hadn't sent the email asking for answers. Days later, I received a call from..a call center rep.  They wanted a credit card to charge me for repairs and return.  I explained I had not received a diagnosis, or details of defects/parts.  She explained she was only authorized to take my credit card.  ""May I speak to someone about the repairs needed"".  Then began a series of back and forth call center fun and games.  Finally, one informed me that she would call the repair center for details.  She placed me on hold then came back to say her number wasn't working.  I was not surprised.  The good news, she said, is that the motherboard and battery would be replaced and needed my credit card number to begin repairs.  I said, how did we go from a diagnosis of ""no defects found"" to EVERYTHING internally would need to be replaced?  She had no answers.  I asked ot speak to a higher level manager.  She said it wold take 2-3 business days.

Three days later, someone called and asked for my payment to begin the  repairs.  I asked of he was higher-level management.  He said yes.  I asked why did we go from nothing to everything is wrong.  He had no answers.  He admitted he was just a rep from..you got it, a call center.  Finally, under pressure, he provided my with the holy grail..the repair center's number, or so he said.  I was skeptical and asked him repeatedly, is this REALLY the repair center's number?  Oh, yes, ""Donald"" assured me.  Meanwhile, I'm now receiving automatically generated messages to send in my device for repair.  Today, 2/22/2017, I called the number and got on the line....a rep from A CALL CENTER, who wanted my credit card.  I explained what had transpired and why I was getting very annoyed.  Exasperated she said her options for me included returning the tablet unrepaired, taking payment to begin the repair, or, upon my request, getting a return call from a ""higher-level"" manager.  Skeptical, I said, I was told that last time and it was a call center rep.  How can I trust that it will be REAL executive who can help resolve this very simple question""  ""why did my  tablet diagnosis go from noting is defective to all is defective, and cost isn't just the repair shops way to end the issue by replacing the motherboard and battery?  And, in my head, I'm asking, ""will they actually replace anything""?  She promised it will be a manager.  Bet it will be a call center rep looking for payment or a decision.

Bottom line.  If you need repairs on a tablet (it's possible CVE repairs all Samsung devices) and are accustomed to the industry standard of returning the product for repairs, waiting for a diagnostic examination and a report, usually in a call, explanation identifying the problem and what needs  repairing, fuggeddaboutit.  Now, I understand why so many people lodge complaints about Samsung poor customer service experience.  The irony?  I have half-dozen Samsung flat-screen TVs, the tablet, and have my wife and I have owned every cell phone beginning with the Galaxy 4 to my Galaxy S7 Edge.. Stay tuned.  My tablet saga continues.

UPDATE:  3/72017
Apparently, Samsung corporate noted this review, and if so, it should encourage buyers that manufactures patrol reviews to leanr customer feedback and experiences.

Finally, Angela K, Samsung Executive Customer Relations specialist called me.  She seemed genuinely concerned that I had suffered this dizzying experience with the repair service and put the burden completely on Samsung.  She made short work of it, had my  tablet repaired and shipped out in a day.  She even provided an email address for follow-up, a sure sign of remediation attempt.

Did the repairs work?  Absolutely.  Upon return, the tablet charged in 5 hours to 100%, and in every test of using it until the battery discharges to about 26%, it charges up reliability every-time to full capacity. It also was returned with the charging port making a very tight connection. This makes for a perfect fit and charging process.

What am to conclude?  That when purchased, the tablet was a lemon.  This isn't uncommon as there is an industry failure rate or ""exposure rate"": out of 10,000 made, there is a slight numerical incidence of failures.  This places even great importance on the manufacturer's repair service to operate a top-drawer service with excellent customer service.

Bottom Line:  SAMSUNG NEEDS TO PERFORM A SYSTEMIC REVIEW TO ENSURE ITS GREAT PRODUCTS ARE MATCHED IN REPAIR SERVICE EXCELLENCE FOR THE SAKE OF ITS CONSUMER REPUTATION.

Then, everyone wins.  And, fair is fair.  Although the one-star rating was deserved, now changing and raising it by two-more stars is deserved for finally ""getting it right"".  The tablet's performance  and value was never in question.",02-22-2017,02-22-2017

In my 2+ years of ownership, I've had no problems with my Tab S 10.5.  I keep it in a slim leather-ish case/cover and it's survived a few drops from bed or table height with no damage.  Battery life is decent, giving 6-10 hours of mixed surfing and video watching.  It has a microSD card slot to provide extra storage space for music, video, etc. files up to 128GB.

The most inexplicable thing is that the price went up over $200 since I bought mine.  Yeah, limited availability is probably part of that, but the 9.7"" Tab S2 isn't that much cheaper (or better, for that matter).  I've started being very careful with my Tab S now since replacing it won't be an option.  The tablet wars are apparently over, unfortunately.",12-22-2016,12-22-2016

Originally I just loved this Android wifi tablet and the Android 5 Lollipop OS.

On, or around, September of 2016, I received an Over the Air (OTA) update of the Android operating system to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Since that update, the tablet will often restart itself. I was using the tablet as part of the control system for Phantom 4 quadcopter. As you might imagine, when the tablet reboots itself while flying, it creates a major safety hazard. Had to purchase a different tablet for use with the Phantom.

I contacted Samsung support. Of course the tablet is out of warranty. They claim this is not a know issue, though it is all over the internet when you do a Google search. They requested that I do a factory reset. Did so and had to reload all my apps. No improvement. So I emailed them again and told them just wanted to send it in and have them downgrade the OS back to Lollipop. Told them I would pay the service charge. I received an email response saying they couldn't do that. C'mon now. What they mean is they wouldn't do it. I'm going to have to find a local source who can do this for me.

This evening, the tablet rebooted itself three times.

My wife and I currently have Samsung phones and tablets. But, I will NEVER buy another Samsung product. They did a huge disservice when they automatically updated the OS and my wonderful tablet is now a piece of garbage.",11-22-2016,11-22-2016

I was looking at the new 10.1 Tab A, but the smartphone-like aspect ratio is not what I consider the best in a tablet. My Tab 4 10.1 has the more square aspect and so does the 10.5. As opposed to the 10.1, this tablet has some odd battery-charging issues. Doing this helped:
Tablet batteries benefit from *conditioning* cycles.
a.) Next  time you charge, drain the battery down to zero until the device turns off (increasing brightness and screen-on time helps)
b.) charge battery to 100% -- then use the tablet as you normally would
c.) this should be repeated a few times when new, and then every couple months thereafter
Try these steps to see if that helps with your battery charging/cycle life.

So the 10.5 is the bee's knee's - rooting helped but if anyone ever thought getting Windows to run smooth well, try one of these bloatware-filled Samsung tablets. I wish Motorola made tabs just like this - they're phones only have 1/3 the crap this tablet.

https://www.amazon.com/Tablet-Stand-Adjustable-Lamicall-Reader/dp/B01DBV1OKY?th=1,33,Electronics,"Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5-Inch Tablet (16 GB, Titanium Bronze)",4.5,5,"Really nice, large, high-resolution screen, with all the usual features of a Samsung Android WiFi tablet","I purchased this Galaxy Tab S 10.5"" tablet to replace an aging Galaxy Tab 3 8.0"" tablet that has a dying battery. I could have replaced that battery, but decided that I really wanted the larger high-res screen of the Tab S. I have used the new tablet for a week, and will start this initial review with a list of first impressions presented as bullet points.

1. What separates this tablet from most others in the 8"" to 10"" size range is obviously the display. At 25601600 pixels, with a screen resolution of 288 pixels per inch, the Super AMOLED display is superb for viewing small print text, still photos, or HD video. The dual quad-core processors really make a difference when viewing videos: this tablet plays videos noticeably smoother than the same video file played on my Galaxy Tab 3 8.0"".

2. For such a large tablet, the weight is not bad. It weighs only about 15% more than my 8"" Galaxy Tab 3, despite being much larger.

3. This tablet, Samsung model number SM-T800, is officially supported by CyanogenMod, which currently has a build of CM version 12 available. CyanogenMod v. 12 uses the Android v. 5 ""Lolipop"" kernal, so flashing the tablet with this ROM not only gets rid of all the useless Samsung and Google bloatware, it also updates the tablet from KitKat to Lolipop. I installed CM-12 on the tablet right out of the box (voiding my warranty, I know, but that's another issue), and it worked perfectly, first time. A few taps to enable Developer Options and Root Access, and the tablet is now fully ""mine"", and operates the way I need it to, and not the way Google thinks it should. Unfortunately, the stupid restriction that Google put on Kit Kat, of not allowing Apps to write to the external SD card, was carried over into Lolipop, and thus also into this build of CyanogenMod, so you have to do the well-known hack on the ""platform.xml"" file to remove the restriction, but it's easy to do since CyanogenMod has root access. There's another cool feature in this CyanogenMod build: Mass Storage Mode is back! Unfortunately, it's only for the external SD card, and not for the Internal Storage, but it's better than not having UMS at all. Of course, there's always the MTP-Alternative app, which gives ""drive letter access"" to both the Internal and External storage, but MTP-Alternative has a few quirks of it's own; since it's a TCP/IP based interface, it's speed is considerably slower than UMS, and it may choke when asked to transfer really big files like videos. NOTE: If you want to use MTP-Alternative to write files from your Windows PC to your Android device, the device has to be rooted and the ""platform.xml"" hack has to be in place. Since this tablet is being officially supported by the CyanogenMod development organization, there is a good possibility that CM version 13 will become available for it, which would update the tablet to Android v. 6 ""Marshmallow"". This would bring to the Tab S the ability to integrate an external SD card of up to 128 gB as ""Adoptable"" storage, expanding the space available for Apps and App data by a factor of at least 10x over the slightly less than 11 gB of internal storage available to the user now.

4. If you don't have the desire to run a custom firmware ROM like CyanogenMod, the stock KitKat operating system the tablet comes with is okay, except for the horrible restriction of apps not being able to write to the external SD card. To work around this, the tablet has to be ""rooted"", which immediately voids your warranty, so that you can make two small edits in the /system/etc/permissions/platform.xml file. You have to root the tablet to even be able to ""see"" this file, otherwise, the system will not allow your file manager or any text editor to access the file even for reading, let alone editing. If you're going to have to root the tablet to get rid of the write restriction on the external SD card, you might as well just replace the stock KitKat OS with CyanogenMod 12.1.

5. Form factor: This tablet is unbelievably thin and light (16.4 ounces, or 465 grams). It's hard to believe there's a 7900 mAH battery in there. The buttons are on the long side of the tablet, rather than the short side, which is what I am used to on Samsung devices, but I'll get used to it, I suppose. Becuse this tablet is so large and so thin, and the bezel is so small, don't even think for a moment that you will be using this thing ""naked"", the way it comes out of it's factory packaging. You absolutely have to buy a case for it: order one on Amazon when you order the tablet. There are many cases available, in prices ranging from $9 for a basic one, to $40 for a fancy one. I have the $9 ProCase, and have also used a $12 MoKo case on my 8"" tablet. They're cheap, but they do protect the tablet from most damages, and make it much easier to hold.

6. Included software: The usual mix of software, ranging from functional apps that you need to play music or video files, or look at photos, read text, and do email, to ""bloatware"" with almost no conceivable use. There's hundreds of megabytes of this junk, and you can't delete it unless you root the tablet. And in some respects, it's risky to delete software on an Android device unless you really are sure what you're doing. There's a lot of cross-linking of Android software, and deleting something could have unforeseen adverse consequences. For example, on my old Galaxy Tab 3, I deleted a certain system file while trying to disable the oh-so-annoying Google pop-up that always asks if you want to use WiFi to increase accuracy when doing GPS navigation. BTW, this is one of the stupidest pop-ups I've ever seen - how could the programmer at Google who wrote that prompt have even thought that someone driving a motor vehicle would even HAVE access to WiFi?. Anyway, I deleted the file, and doing so did indeed get rid of the annoying pop-up, but only later did I discover that deleting that file permanently broke several other Google apps, including Gmail and the Play Store. I had to re-install the operating system completely to fix this ""oops"", which nuked all my App data. Shortly after that, I installed CyanogenMod on that tablet, which took care of the problem. For what it's worth, almost all of the Samsung and Google software that comes bundled can be replaced with third-party apps that are at least as good, if not better, from the Play Store. These include Office productivity suites, Music and Video players, Games, text editors, Calculator emulators, Keyboard emulators (I like The Hacker's Keyboard), Internet Browsers (the tablet comes with Chrome, which I immediately replaced with Firefox), tons of Clock widgets, E-book readers (I like FBReader), File and Task Managers (ES File Manager/Task Manager), etc. etc. With something like a half-million apps on the Play Store, I'm sure you can find enough apps with which to fritter your whole life away.

7. Camera: The 8 mpx built-in camera is pretty basic. It shoots JPEG's that are about 1.5 megabyte file size, so they're rather heavily compressed. The camera lens can be zoomed a little, maybe 3x, and light sensitivity is pretty low, as you would expect from a camera lens and sensor this small. It really only works well in full daylight. There is a built-in LED flash that helps a little, but it's range is limited, maybe 3 to 4 feet. I guess if you are trying to take photos indoors at a kid's birthday party or something similar, the LED light is better than nothing. But I'd rather have a real camera in the first place for something as important as my kid's or grandkid's birthday. Remarkably, the camera has a HUGE range of focus, from infinity down to just an inch or two, which I was not expecting. The front camera is very low resolution, 1.2 mpx, which I guess is enough for VOIP services like Skype (I haven't tried it myself). Bottom line is that this camera isn't very good - even the bottom of the line Canon and Nikon pocket cameras take better photos. Don't buy this tablet for the camera.

NOTE: If you do decide to go with CyanogenMod, the Camera applet that comes with it is not as feature rich as the Samsung OEM Camera app, but with the tablet boasting only a modest 8 megapixel camera, I suggest that the slightly less capable camera app should not stop you from at least considering CyanogenMod, at least after the 1 year warranty expires and you've got nothing to lose by flashing a non-Samsung ROM. BTW, if you flash CyanogenMod v12.1 and decide you don't like it, you can easily restore the tablet back to it's original state by re-flashing it with the OEM operating system (currently Android v 4.4.2 Kit Kat). This is a 1.8 gigabyte file, named [XAR-T800XXU1ANFB-20140707180849.zip] available from several sources on the Internet. You use the ""ODIN"" program on your PC to ""sideload"" this file back onto the tablet in ""download"" mode. NOTE: This ZIP file has a ""tar"" file inside it, and it's this ""tar"" file that you actually sideload with ODIN.

Negatives: All of the above should be considered this tablet's ""positive"" attributes. That said, there is at least one ""negative"", and that's the speakers. Playing MP3 or Video files, they only sound acceptable (actually they're quite good) up to about 50% of full volume. From 50% to 75%, there's an ever-increasing amount of distortion and clipping, and above 75% the distortion is horrible. This distortion is definitely in the speakers, and not in the tablet's audio processing hardware: using headphones, music sounds great all the way to 100% volume. This issue is mostly noticeable when using the tablet as an alarm clock, with a music file as the alarm tone. In alarm clock mode, you're probably going to have the volume cranked up high, unless you're a light sleeper, and waking up in the morning to a favorite song being mangled by overdrive distortion through inadequate speakers isn't my idea of the start of a wonderful day. I guess you can work around this by using one of those portable speakers, bypassing the built-in ones, but then that's another gadget you have to carry.

Summary: If you want a tablet that really offers the most screen space and resolution possible, but a 12"" or larger tablet is simply too large or too expensive, this Tab S 10.5"" tablet is arguably the ""ultimate"" tablet in Samsung's model lineup. The new Tab S2 models are a little less expensive, but that's because they are ""downgraded"": they are using a 4:3 aspect ratio screen, with a lower overall resolution, and a smaller capacity battery, rather than the 16:10 screen of the Tab S 10.5, which makes them a little less pleasing for watching wide-screen movies or playing certain games designed for 16:10 tablets. If you are also a ""power user"", this tablet is officially supported by the CyanogenMod Project, and CyanogenMod-12.1 (Android v5 ""Lolipop"") is available now, with possibly CM-13 (Android v6 ""Marshmallow"") coming sooner or later. I will be updating this review from time to time, or if any problems crop up with the tablet. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

LAST WORD: This is a WiFi ONLY Tablet! It DOES NOT have Cell Phone capability! I can't believe how many people ask the question ""can this tablet access GSM towers?""

UPDATE December 29, 2016 - Two problems have appeared with my tablet. The first is that the battery charge capacity seems to be declining noticeably, and much sooner than I would have expected. The tablet is only a few months old, yet the battery charge drops at a rate more like that of a tablet that's 3 or 4 years old. This could be simply a manufacturing defect in the battery, or perhaps the very large, very high resolution of the screen makes this tablet more of a power hog than what I was used to with my 8"" Galaxy Tab 3 that this 10.5"" Tab S replaced.  The second problem is also charging related: the MicroUSB connector has developed a problem, in that it has become very finicky about which charging cables I can use with the tablet. I own 4 or 5 chargers, both 120vAC and 12vDC, and a half-dozen or more cables, and the one one that still charges this tablet is one that originally came with my LG-840G cell phone. The strange thing is that the Tablet's charge indicator shows that the tablet is charging, but only the LG cell phone charger and cable actually push charge into the tablet. The various other chargers and MicroUSB cables that are not working properly with this tablet all do work properly to charge my old 8"" Samsung Tab 3, and my cell phone. So the problem seems to be in the Tab S connector, or maybe it's battery. I am going to order a new charger and cable and see if this solves the problem.",07-21-2016,07-21-2016

It is thin, light, and the screen is incredible!

I figured I'd focus on the two issues I have with the tablet.

1) Although you can dim the screen it seems to be very dark at the lower end, then about 1/10th of the way toward bright it just steps up noticeably, and then it gets much brighter right at the end.  It's too bad there is not more darkness gradient at the lower end of the slider, it's just very dark to kind of bright very rapidly.

2) No matter the brightness of the screen, every time you touch the screen the back button and window button (on either side of the physical button under the screen) light up full brightness.  This can be annoying if you're reading in bed in the dark for instance, with the brightness the whole way down, but it keeps flashing you with bright light every time you scroll!

Overall this tablet is spectacular and I don't think there is a better tablet available elsewhere, but that doesn't mean this one has no room for improvement.  Also, make sure to get a case, I really like the Samsung one that snaps into the two button holes in the back!",10-24-2015,10-24-2015

Eleven months into ownership, the battery performance of my Tab S began to fail... as in 1% decrease every 2 minutes while surfing the Web.  One week after the warranty expired, Bluetooth failed.  The next week, WiFi failed.  Also, the Tab S has an incredible amount of adhesive securing the system board to the housing... don't believe the ""you can replace your battery with a spudger"" videos.

The 10.5"" 2560x1600 screen is vividly bright and sharp, the eight-core Exynos processor cleverly combines high performance with power efficiency, and battery life is good  it'll go all day on a full charge, even watching videos.

The smartest thing about this tablet is its processor.  It's really two four-core processors in one  an efficient one, and a high-performance one.  When it's idling or doing un-demanding tasks like, say, displaying an e-book, it runs on the four low-power CPU cores to maximize its battery life.  Ask it to do something demanding like play a game or a high-defniition movie, and it seamlessly switches to the four high-performance cores.  You won't even know it's done it.

There are larger screens available, like Samsung's 12.1"" Galaxy Tab Pro.  However, they come burdened down with a lot of faux-business applications that you probably don't want, and they're not enough bigger to justify their price premium.  The Galaxy Tab S has a big enough and sharp enough screen to make it a superb e-reader, while still slipping into a jacket pocket.  Granted, there's some bloatware on the Tab S as well, starting with ""My Magazine"" aka Flipboard, the Samsung bloatware app that 90% of Samsung owners learn to love to hate, but which Samsung won't let us remove.  But it's not bad, and Flipboard can at least be locked out.

To be fair, there is one downside to the Galaxy Tab S, and that is its fingerprint scanner ... which, bluntly, is utterly worthless.  It has to scan your fingertip nine or ten times to ""learn"" it, and every time you swipe it, you have to have the angle, and the pressure, and the speed all just right, or it won't recognize your print.  Hand's sweaty?  So sorry, try again.  And even when you do get it working, it can only recognize one fingertip per user.  I tried the fingerprint authentication for about a week, before I gave up on it after the ""cool factor"" wore out next to the ""swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe slower, a bit to the left, slower, now straighter, make sure you swipe the entire fingertip...""  ....oh, forget it, it's easier to just type a password.  Sorry, Samsung, but this is a terrible fingerprint-scanner implementation that isn't likely to accomplish anything but souring users on fingerprint authentication.

Now my Barska biometric safe, by comparison, could show Samsung how it's done.  But I digress...

Another shortcoming specific to this model is ... look, OK, just spring for the 32GB internal storage, OK?  16GB really isn't enough.  It SHOULD be enough; but unfortunately, Android is atrociously bad at managing storage.  You SHOULD be able to tell Android ""Use the SD card slot for everything possible, use the internal storage only when you have to.""  But you can't.  And that's a shame, because Android, based on Linux, should be able to do much better.  This is not a hard problem.

But this is really Android's fault, not Samsung's.

Samsung has recently released their new Galaxy Tab S2, but it's not clear to me yet what the technical improvements in it are, and it's not available in a 10.5"" screen (yet) anyway.  If you're looking for a 10""-range touchscreen tablet, look no further.  This is the one to buy.",09-21-2015,09-21-2015

For some odd reasons, I've not seen Samsung advertise it much, but this is one of their best tabs. I've migrated from an Asus Tab 700, so I know what great tabs look like. However, with 3 years behind the wheel, my Asus was giving up and I was in the market looking for a replacement. Decided to get this over a fire tab.

Pros:
1. 3 GB RAM - one of the most important features to ensure your tab does not lag. Only tab in the market with this size screen and this much RAM
2. Octa core processor - one of the fastest in the market
3. Android 5
4. Thin and light - lighter than Ipad Air
5. Fingerprint sensor for authentication

Cons:
1. Too much bloatware - you can, of course, disable apps, but cannot remove them without rooting

In the same price range as the fire HDX, IMHO, this is a better deal and a value for money.

I've owned several of them.  I wish I'd just bought this one first.  The other Android tablets were all second rate compared to this Galaxy Tab S 10.5.  The iPads are nice but they don't have nearly as many free apps available as Android tablets do and I don't find their speed and quality to be any better than this tablet.

I was careless with my first Galaxy Tab S 10.5 and it was stolen.  I guess the thief knew quality when he saw it.  This Galaxy Tab is simply the best one available and I didn't hesitate to buy exactly the same model as a replacement.

The screen resolution and color is outstanding.  The cameras are good.  The touch screen is extremely responsive and the two quad-core processors don't leave you tapping your foot waiting for you apps to start.

I elected to get the 16GB model.  You can get the 32GB model but it is more expensive.  Since this tablet takes MicroSD cards up to 128GB, that is definitely a much more frugal way to add some storage.

After you do your homework, I think you will find that this tablet beats Apple and Microsoft feature for feature, and in price.
  Second, Amazon is working with Android again.  All of the issues playing Prime video have been resolved and an app is available at the Google store.  It works.
  Third, sometimes electronics go South.  Mine did after 10 months of daily use.  The WiFi and Bluetooth just stopped working and wouldn't load.  Pressing the icon to turn it on did nothing.  The words ""Turning on..."" were the only thing I saw in the Wi-Fi setting.  In WiFi and Bluetooth, no potential systems to connect to were displayed.  The first thing I did was an internet search for the problem -- it has happened to others.  I tried a ""soft"" reboot (involves the Home, Power, and Sound up button) which did not work.  As the product was still under the 12 month Warranty, I logged onto Samsung.com and started to research.  They had NOTHING about this specific issue, so I used Live Chat thru the Samsung website and communicated thru typing with a Samsung Representative.  We went thru the script that must be used when this problems occurs.  Bottom line, I had done everything I could to resolve it and the final process, a factory re-set (which wipes out all of your data), was requested.  We did it.  During the reboot the screen to connect to WiFi came up and we never got past it -- my WiFi would not turn on.  Next I was linked over to ""Request Repair"".  I spent the next hour repeating all that had been done and was told that I would be contacted by Samsung over the telephone.  True to their word, I was and spent the next 15 minutes repeating all that had been done.  Next I was emailed a shipping label for UPS.  So my unit is on its way for repair and I will be spending hours of set-up when it comes back to me.  Is it worth it, YES!!!",08-17-2015,08-17-2015

Internet connection slow""","Straight out the box, this thing refuses to connect to my wi-fi. Every other wireless device that has ever entered my house has been able to connect but his thing ""fails to obtain an ip address"" and displays the message ""AP currently not in use. Internet connection slow"". I've tried every suggested solution I can find but the only one that sort of works is for me to manually input my ip address into the tablet. *(how-to below)
The problem with this method is that it's only effective at home. I can't get the ip addresses of places like public hotspots.

Also the tablet - currently running Android 4.2.2 - refuses to update to Lolipop. It'll download just fine but on reboot, the percentage stays around the 25%-30% mark, restarts, tries again, then shows an error message. Infuriating since it is suggested that updating the tablet would solve the wi-fi issue. I tried updating using Samsung's Kies program but nothing happens.

Besides these problem, the tablet is pretty good. The screen is very pretty, the audio is loud-ish and the battery life is impressive, though the charging takes forever (about 6 hours). I could have done without all the bloatware though, most of which cannot be un-installed, only hidden.

For a $350+ tablet, I am very disappointed with what I got. More so because Samsung has failed to provide a simple online solution. I've bought far cheaper tablets that connect as soon as I input my wi-fi password. It has been suggested that the problem lies with Samsung meddling with the Android os and seeing as this is a Samsung exclusive problem, I'm inclined to agree.

*In the Wi-fi settings, select your internet and click ""Forget"". Then select again, type in your password, select both boxes below (1. Show PW and 2. Show advanced options), scroll down and change IP settings from DHCP to Static and then type in your IP address (google how to) then press connect.",08-16-2015,08-16-2015

I paid $399 and it really was worth it. also some of  my games can go on the sd card. I brought a 32gb card, since I spent $399 on the tab that was all I could afford.

I read research by professional techies, pored over recommendations at blog sites, and asked many others what they enjoy using for a tablet.  The overwhelming response was the Apple brand.  That said, the next best choice was the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 Tablet.

Since I use an Android phone and don't have Apple products, it seemed pointless to buy a Tablet that would not seamlessly sync with my other electronics.  If you are an Apple user, you would probably be wise to choose one of this brands products.

I love my Samsung tablet!  It was quite easy to learn how to use it.  The size and light weight make it a pleasure to use and carry.  The color is vivid; the clarity is sharp, with a resolution of 2560 x 1600.  Samsung lets the user determine the screens brightness.  As a result, it can be used both indoors and out with ease.

The sound is sharp and I find no problems with it.  Watching a movie and hearing its content is a pleasure.  There is no sense of muffled sound at all.

The tablet connects to my WiFi at home.  If I take it out, I can connect via my phone.  And battery life is remarkably long lasting.  After doing emails, reading, and practicing how to use it, my battery power (after three days) is a strong 56%.

I like the touch screen technology and when writing emails, it has the ability to learn my writing style; often offering words before Ive even fully typed or selected them.

I initially wanted to use my tablet to take pictures while on a trip.  It has more pixels (8 front facing) than my older Canon camera.  My phone can take a comparable picture, too, as compared to the tablet.  Money had to be considered, also.  So, I had a choice; I could buy a camera or a tablet.  I opted for the tablet, choosing to take pictures with my phone.  The Samsung Galaxy allows me so much more than a camera.  I can do emails, read my Kindle books, watch movies, listen to music, play games, and write.  Yes, it would be nice to have an extremely good camera, but this was the best choice overall.

The first one arrived yesterday but there was a severe defect. I am returning it today. I ordered another one with the 2 year warranty that is not from Samsung.

Pros
- Amazing display

Cons
- I bought this to replace my 10.1 Note that was 1.5 years old. The screen suddenly went black. When I received this the screen would intermittently turn on and off. By slightly moving the tablet it would get better or worse so I think it is probably a problem with the connection of the screen to the rest of the tablet. I see in the 1 star reviews that others had this problem as well as other screen problems such as the screen just going dark. After researching this, I believe that Samsung has a design, manufacturing, or quality control issue with the connection of the screen to the rest of the tablet.

- The micro USB connector was moved from bottom (on my Note) to the right side. This is a significant problem as I have a couple of apps that I use a lot that do not rotate. They place the USB connector on the bottom. This makes it hard to use the device while charging. I hope Samsung returns the USB connector back to the bottom in future models.

- After reading the negative reviews, it seems Samsung has poor customer support. I wish Samsung would improve this. When I re-ordered the tablet today, I also ordered the 2 year warranty from another company.

8-6-2015 Update

The 16 GB of memory is now full. Most of the free memory is taken up by apps. When trying to move the apps to the memory card many cannot be moved or when they can be moved, most of the app stays on the device memory. I am very unhappy with this. Samsung should start supplying their equipment with a minimum of 32 GB of internal memory and have 64 and 128 GB options available. I am lowering my rating from 4 to 3 stars.

9-9-2015

This is an additional update. I am downgrading this to 1 star. 15 GB of internal memory is not enough. I am now totally out of memory. I tried to move the apps to the external 64 GB memory card but only a portion of the apps will move. This is insane. In addition, the device comes loaded with apps that I do not want but cannot remove.

In addition, moving the micro USB connector to the side is very problematic. There are a number of apps including FaceBook pictures that require setting the device in portrait mode on the side where the micro USB connector is. It is not possible to use the device like this with the micro USB connector plugged in.

I am beginning to hate this device. My suggestion to Samsung is to make future devices with 32-128 GB of internal memory and to move the micro USB connector on the side where the home and other icons are.",06-20-2015,06-20-2015

I really want to love my Galaxy Tab S 10.5, but it is more like a friend with benefits in that some things just bug me enough not to use it as much as I should.  Despite having 3GB of ram to cache more running processes and applications, the slower CPU really shows itself when loading apps or switching from anything CPU intensive.  Compared to the relatively snappy performance of the quad core 2.5ghz in my S5, screen lag and general responsiveness can be sluggish and downright laggy.  Samsung chose to use 4@1.9ghz and 4@1.3ghz for what is technically 8 cores.  I think the overall faster quad core with less RAM is showing better performance than the slower octa setup and given that they both have separate GPU's, I do not know if the higher resolution graphics @ 2560x1600 over 1920x1080 is a factor in this.  I also know that optimizations can make up for speed and core differences but I don't think that is at play here.

Now, let me say that this is still a fine piece of equipment.  Using my S5 as a mobile hotspot, my Tab 10.5 has the ability to have internet access anywhere I can use my S5 directly.  Normally though, I keep it in my store on wi-fi (5ghz) as a reference tool for databases.  Video looks phenomenal and streaming to other Samsung HDTV's works flawlessly.  Multiple user profiles make it easy to manage additional users although performance is a little more sluggish than usual with more than one profile active.  Quick connect let me setup streaming to my Samsung HDTV easily, but then my S5 (Verizon with 5.0) and wife's Note 4 do as well, not to mention her old off network Sprint Note 2 which is essentially a dedicated video streamer now, using a web interface I wrote for media sharing off my file server. (Seriously, they all work brilliantly at it)

What doesn't work is direct media sharing.  There is no NFC (near field communication) and none of the other direct sharing options reliably work.  With every combination I can think of involving ""Nearby Devices"", wi-fi and Bluetooth, Android Beam, Quick Connect, nothing works as all transfers wind up timing out usually after a couple megs.  I have gotten 1 solitary picture to successfully transfer via Wi-Fi direct. I have tried distances from touching to across the room, both on 2.4ghz, then 5ghz and then 1 each WiFi frequencies through the router and still they time out.  NFC works great between my S5 and her Note4.  I can't even connect my S5 directly to the Tab 10.5 with a USB/USBOTG cable because it recognizes the S5 as a ""High Power Device"" and immediately shuts down access.  I imagine I could get a powered hub but at that point using my PC or something like Drive/Dropbox as a go between is simpler. It is things like this that have caused Samsung innovations to be abandoned and revert to iPhone clones...... S6 I am looking at you.

Battery drain in ""standby"" mode with the screen off is almost nil due to having few application that actively sync in the background.  Keep in mind, I have stopped or uninstalled as much bloatware as I can without rooting.  I do not use either Power Saver mode and generally keep bluetooth off unless using a keyboard.  I keep the screen at full brightness.  Depending on the bandwidth involved, battery life seems to be about 10% per hour of usage.  I have yet to get it below 58% in a day yet and that was during all my failed video transfer attempts.

I cannot speak much on it's comfort as a stand alone device meaning I have it in a rather bulky folder/stand/keyboard combo that should protect it quite a bit.  The screen stays relatively smudge free in that they aren't usually noticeable when in use.  The Gorilla Glass 3 screen should hold up very well like my S5 which has been scratch free for almost a year with no screen protector.

So this might have seemed overly critical but probably because I am comparing it to my darling S5, a device released before the Tab 5.  I know, supposedly different purposes, but other than cellular service, not really.  Tablet wise, with the price drop I jumped on, it is overall a very nice piece of equipment.  I hope I can get a couple years usage out of it.  It is the first time I have allowed myself to buy a higher end device without a user replaceable battery.",06-12-2015,06-12-2015

The only draw back (which really has nothing to do with the tablet's quality), after purchasing, I realized that Samsung had a new Galaxy available, the 12.2. ALSO. Had I known the different between the TAB and the NOTE, I would have definitely purchased the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2. The difference in the two tablets: the TAB S 10.5 DOES NOT use a stylist (pen), but the NOTE Pro does use a stylist. I asked Samsung if they had an ""after market"" stylist for the Tab S 10.5 and they responded no. So if you want a stylist with your tablet, definitely go with the Note Pro. Other than that, it's a great tablet and an outstanding picture quality and easy to use interface (although do expect a short learning curve if you're going from a PC to a tablet).

I really enjoy my Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5-Inch Tablet, very much it gets alot of use and I am glad I purchased it.

What I like about it:
Screen resolution is awesome
-Super AMOLED Display with 2560x1600 WQXGA Resolution
-Super AMOLED is amazing, you have to see it in person, amazing looking, so nice to look at
Colors are amazing (blacks are ""BLACK"" whites are ""WHITE"") really really nice color and resolution
Boots fast enough for me
Easy to navigate around the OS (Android Kit Kat)

Cons:
not many
-battery life is short
-recharge time is obnoxiously long (a bit of an issue)
-webpage/web usage the battery life is much shorter

The camera works well
Video I haven't used much but it does record in 1080 (HD)

As far as all the specs they are already listed on this Amazon webpage - not ""copping out"" here but redundant to list them

Most noticeable to me is (again):
the Super AMOLED screen
2560x1600 WQXGA Resolution
Colors are so nice, blacks are the blackest, whites are the whitest
Resolution is amazing
It is a beautiful screen all around - beautiful
10.1"" screen size is just enough anything less for me would be too small
Easy to resize text, just use your thumb and pointing finger and expand outwards (inc size) or inwards (dec size)
Easy to use

It feels substantial in my hands and with a case, easy to hold. I do not like the placement of the ""back"" button and folders button.....it is too easy to accidentally hit it when using the Kindle reading app. No good way to hold it in the portrait position while reading. I have had one dreaded moment after owning it a bit over a month, opened it and it was dead !!  Wouldn't come on, zilch, zero. And it had been on charger all night, tried different charger, different plug, everything. My hubby is more of tech person and he had to repeatedly do a reset [holding down the power and volume buttons repeatedly trying many different ways, figuring we had nothing to lose]  One hour later and Finally......the tablet booted up......home screen and it appears that a software update [didn't say what kind other than it was a Samsung Software update] was ready to install. I clicked Install and now the tablet operates as normal. But now I no longer trust it. I lost an Asus transformer in this same way.....woke up one day and it was dead to the world, and has never breathed since. So I will be reluctant to trust it without constantly backing up photos etc. and probably will not use it with confidence now. That's just my experience. If I will to purchase again, I think I would go with something that doesn't have so much of this happening.....I would go with an Ipad Air.",06-05-2015,06-05-2015

While it doesn't have the aluminum case like the ipad I was still impressed with the overall build and feel of the tablet. When I powered it up the display was awesome!. After connecting to my network the tablet requested to download an update and that took about 3-4 minutes to complete and lo and behold it was now running Android Lollipop! I now had a chance to run the tablet thru it's paces and the first thing I noticed was the lag! I was replacing my old ipad because of the lag and here I am with a brand new tablet which had more lag than what my ipad 2 had! I tried surfing the internet using chrome , firefox and Samsung's own browser and the experience was not good, a lot of jitter and hesitation. Touchwiz which is Samsung's own overlay just plain stinks in my opinion and uses up way to much of the systems resources and seems to be designed more for advertising Samsung's products than providing the user with a good experience. Overall other than the beautiful display I was not impressed with this tablet at all and even with the price markdown I don't think it was worth the money so I returned it after one day. I'm back using my old ipad and to be honest even though I'd love to buy an android tablet I don't see any of them that can compete with the overall horsepower and user experience of the ipad. The Nexus 9 has build issues and Samsung seems to be more interested in locking the user in to a power hungry overlay called touchwiz, if I wanted that type of experience I would have bought the Amazon fire tablet, the whole purpose of buying an android tablet was to have the ability to change things not be locked in with a bunch of useless apps you can't delete, or a overlay like touchwiz that slows everything down.

I decided on this tablet after recently purchasing the Galaxy S5 phone. Both the S5 and Tab S share the Lollipop Android operating system and I was happy with it (mostly) on the phone, so .... The Xoom 2 is (STILL) an awesome, bulletproof tablet and I would have stayed with Motorola but they no longer make tablets.

Specs are available everywhere so I won't go into them except for what I really like - or don't.

Pros:

Gorilla Glass face - just like the Xoom 2 and extremely durable.

Dual quad-core processors and 3GB of memory - neither Google nor any of the app developers are EVER going to learn to program efficiently so progressively more bloated resource sucking apps and operating systems is just a fact of life. This is BTW the ONLY reason I retired my Xoom 2. :(

Super Amoled Display - amazing, absolutely amazing. I do digital photo processing so I'm used to quality display hardware. This is pretty impressive for a tablet or phone.

Power save/ultra power save - actually works (somewhat of a surprise). The Tab S has two CPUs - one is 1.9Ghz and the other is 1.3Ghz. Both modes switch down to only the 1.3Ghz CPU - which makes a significant difference in power consumption. A side note: the 1.3Ghz CPU is still pretty robust. There's almost no difference in performance for me between normal power and power saving modes.

Battery life span - pretty decent for a tablet with this much horsepower and screen.

Recharge time - is really good compared to my Xoom 2. Not as fast as the S6 phone, but just as fast as the S5.

microSD card - which the S5 and Tab S still have a slot for. Both the 64GB Samsung and Lexar ultra cards I use worked great.

Cons:

The built in, 'hard', buttons - hate them. I like the Xoom 2 'buttons' that were displayed by the OS in the bottom right of screen and followed the orientation of the tablet. So, what if I'm left handed and want it in portrait mode? Or what if some retarded developer decides the 'top' of my tablet is the opposite of the way I want to hold it? This is a big fail for Samsung IMHO. The positioning of the 'buttons' also makes it awkward and irritating to use in portrait orientation.

Bloat-ware - which Samsung is notorious for on their devices. I agree with many reviewers - very nice device overall, almost ruined by the ton of useless crap installed at the factory. Some of it is removable by the user, some can be 'disabled', but some you're just stuck with.

5Ghz wireless - busted. In all fairness, this is an Android problem I believe and not Samsung. Lollipop 5.0 has issues in this area. It'll work for some people and not for others and it might work one time and not another. Interestingly it worked perfectly after upgrading from 4.x.x until I rebooted the Tab S. If you really want/need 5Ghz DON'T upgrade to Lollipop until they get this fixed. 5Ghz Hot Spot worked flawlessly on 4.x.x.

SSL/TLS security in Lollipop - used to created encrypted connections between the host and client, such as HTTPS, secure SMTP and IMAP. I won't get into the stupidity involved here. Be aware if you are connecting to older mail servers using secure SMTP and/or IMAP that protocols have been removed from the Android operating system - the factory email client WILL NOT work. There are tons of posts from people trying to figure out why they no longer can connect to their mail (""Cannot connect to server"") - this is why. There is really only one solution if you're connecting to really old mail servers - don't upgrade to Lollipop. 4.x.x doesn't have this issue. If you're connecting to moderately old mail servers, the K9 mail app will work as it uses its own libraries apparently, and not the OS libraries. Something to note: if you're using a web browser to access old 'out of band' equipment (like HP RILOs), old broad band routers, etc. via HTTPS, removal of 'insecure' protocols will make the devices inaccessible.

Android's increasingly obscure system menus - Episode V. Lollipop. Again, not entirely a Samsung issue. If there is ANY way to make it more difficult to find something, it seems Google and Samsung will do it and excel. Can't wait for Episode VI. :(

16GB internal storage AND Lollipop 'save/move to microSD' changes - so its great that it'll accept big microSD cards especially since the 32GB Tab S is insanely expensive. EXCEPT - changes in Lollipop restrict moving a lot of data from internal storage to the microSD card making it almost useless unless you just want a place to put your music, videos and photos. IMHO, nothing but a way to make you pay an inflated price for extra internal memory you otherwise wouldn't need. Hmmmm. Can anyone say S6? On a fresh device with the half a dozen apps I use regularly + Navigon w/ three states, no music, video or pictures, I was down to about 3GB of internal storage. After moving every app I could to the microSD, it was up to just slightly less than 5GB of free storage. Storage aside, this change also affects how apps can store data on the microSD - such as, they can't, or only some, and what happens to that data if the app is uninstalled - in the case of one of my apps, you loose all your saved data if the app is uninstalled. Note: A very large chunk of the internal memory is sucked up by Samsung's bloat-ware.

TouchWiz launcher - I figured this out before I read all the complaints on the forums. Resource sucking pig. There are better written, faster and more useful launchers on Play Store and that is a good thing because this one is pretty sad.

End of the day, the physical device is very, very nice. The Lollipop operating system, however, is largely more of a pain in the rear end than its worth. Battery life and performance are MODERATELY better under Lollipop but those are the ONLY two upsides to this OS. I would strongly recommend sticking with 4.x.x unless there were pressing reasons to upgrade.

For those much more technical, one positive of the Tab S: since this is such a popular device, there's a lot of documentation on 'rooting' the device and the process is simple and relatively painless. While I REALLY had hoped not to have to go through this on another tablet, it turned out to be the only way to get rid of all of Samsung's and Google's bloat-ware and free up internal storage.

It took about three weeks of rebuilding, reloading, restoring, uninstalling, installing, a generous amount of rubber chicken waving and a lot of cursing, but what I ended up with as a clean, very fast, very nice tablet that I enjoy using. Which is what Samsung SHOULD have released in the first place. I really WANTED to give this tablet five stars, but there is NO WAY I should have had to go through this much time and effort to finally get a useable product. I gave this four stars because the hardware really is VERY, VERY nice and well worth four stars and went quite a way in making up for - at best - the questionable OS and software.",06-02-2015,06-02-2015

Never dropped, no spills, not even much use because of constant problems.  Today it won't recover after trying every tip, hard reset, and speaking to customer support.  The sheer number of internet complants with this tab proves to me that there was a problem from the build.  I've read so many poor reviews for Samsung customer service and repair that I'm afraid I'm out $600.00.  The picture quality remains best in the industry.  Unfortunately you only get to see the screen on occasions when it's working properly. Don't waste your money. The best quality amoled screen images in the world of tablets as far as I'm concerned.  The picture and video playback images seem to POP off the screen in stunning detail.  Having said that I do admit I've had problems.  The battery life is short, I've had issues with the tab freezing, issues with turning it off after it freezes (reaserch proved that simultaneously hard pressing both the on/off switch and volume control at the same time did work to power off the tab), and on 2 occasions the display was unstable, blinking on and off insesently which once again required powering off using both the power off button and volume buttons simultaneously.

I haven't used the fingerprint reader so far as I fear it will not read my fingerprint properly and I won't be able to open it (My skin is very dry and sometimes my fingerprint ridges get messed up) so I can't say how good it is. The tablet seems to have plenty of zip as I've opened multiple windows/apps with no problems so far. I purchased the 10.5 inch because I read a lot of PDFs and wanted to be able to pretty much read the whole page without having to zoom in and scroll around. I also do photography and felt a nice big screen would be a wonderful way to share and show off my photographs. The colorful bright screen should show off my photos very nicely. In fact I was a bit concerned it might be a bit too colorful and bright and not color accurate, but I think it will be fine for the most part and most electronic devices like my smartphone won't totally be color accurate anyway. Speaker sound is very good which is a big plus for me as I love to listen to music and audiobooks. I want to use it for typing brief documents so we'll see how the on-screen keyboard stacks up against a regular keyboard. If I don't care for it I can always purchase a bluetooth keyboard so no worries as far as I'm concerned. For it's size is it's very light. I have to say I think it probably weighs a bit less than my old kindle keyboard which is about half the size. I will be able to hold it up without worrying about arm and hand fatigue after only a short time. The bronze color is very nice and I'm glad I purchased this color. I'm not trying to look like I'm using an iPod. Proud to own this Samsung, thank you. I've only just gotten the tablet so we will see how things stack up over time and if I have any problems I will update this review. Overall for the price I have very few complaints thus far.

And now for the few quibbles:
1. It seemed to take awhile to completely charge the 1st plug in, but then I was also familiarizing myself with it and so I was using power as I was charging it.
2. The SD card insertion was not easy. It's a very narrow slot and you need to push that mini SD card way in. I used a blunted round toothpick to do the job as my finger, which is pretty small as I'm a petite woman, just couldn't do it.
3. Not a biggie, but wasn't impressed with the available apps in the Samsung store nor many of the free apps that came with my tablet. Maybe this will improve with time and there's always Google.

I wish they wouldn't load up these devices with apps we can't remove which just eats up valuable memory.

Occasionally I see someone who wants to stick in a larger SD card and see if it will work. Well I tested a nice new 128GB Samsung mini SD card in it and no go so don't go above the 64GB mini SD card. The tablet was able to read it had a 128GB card in it, but it wouldn't write anything to it so it won't work as far as I can tell.",05-05-2015,05-05-2015

It has a beautiful screen, good software, and great hardware. I've only had the device slow down on me once or twice. The back of the device has a soft feel to it, and although it doesn't look as nice as aluminum, I'd say it's good enough. The tablet is also very light and thin, and overall was a great value.

I would, however, avoid buying this tablet at full retail price, or anything that isn't discounted at at least $330, as you can expect Samsung to release an improved version of this tablet this summer, for around the same retail price.

(Now QUITE a bit of room for improvement)","I love this tablet and, if it weren't for the battery life and how long it takes to recharge, I would give it 5 stars.  The tablet itself is beautiful, thin, lightweight and works beautifully. I have had mine since the beginning of September 2014, and I have only had to reboot it twice since then (due to errors, I mean). The display is beautiful. The sound is quite good, for a tablet. And now that Samsung has allowed it to upgrade to Lollipop, I can run most of my new apps from my 32 gb SD Card and this leaves me a lot less nervous about running out of memory. Though, I still find the 16 GB HD a bit on the tight side overall.

My previous tablet was a Toshiba Excite AT305T16. It was my first tablet, but I still could tell how slow it was. And it constantly needed to be rebooted. Everything kept getting bound up on it. Not so with this Samsung. It is quick, it stays fresh, and it just plain performs. Which is all we ask for, right? I will be buying more Samsung products in the future, I think. Those guys really know and deliver quality. Now, if they could just improve the battery and be a bit more generous with the on-board memory.

UPDATE: I have downgraded my review by one star. I have owned this tablet since August of 2014. And, although I still enjoy it, I am now running out of memory and, even though I have a 64gb sd card attached, I am finding it increasingly challenging and frustrating to manage the remaining space. While many of the apps can be moved to the SD card, most of them can't. And the apps themselves are becoming larger and larger overall. And, to make matters worse, suddenly, I can no longer update many of my apps residing on the SD card, unless I move them back to the internal storage first. This is too laborious and time consuming and I haven't found a fix for it yet. Also, suddenly I can no longer move PDF files onto the SD card either. Other types of files can be moved as before, but not the PDF files. Wondering if the tablet performed some sort of automatic system upgrade that may have triggered these issues. When I ""upgraded"" (and I use that term lightly, with tongue in cheek) from Kitkat to Lollipop, the tablet lost some very useful functions. So now I have to wonder why these problems are suddenly cropping up?",04-28-2015,04-28-2015

Pros:

-Great Build quality
-I love the texture of the case
-Flash on the back camera
-The screen makes the iPad Air retina jealous
-Watching movies with dark scenes is watchable
-Samsung scaled back Touchwiz on this
-Expandable memory
-Battery life is on par with my iPad Air
-Super thin and light

Cons:
-Wish it supported a USB port (most androids don't)
-Samsung slow to update O/S on premium device (Apple wins hands down on updates)
-bloatware
-wish expandable memory was sd size not micro sd
-16gb...really samsung.

I also have the keyboard that goes with it.  Wish the keyboard had a pointing device.

Overall Samsung did an excellent job with this unit.  Just remember Samsung has a history of not updating their tablets and they release tablets almost every day.  Good support from XDA developers on custom roms to keep devices base OS updated.

Most pro reviewers don't think there is a need for multi tasking (watching vids and surfing net at same time) on tablet.  I disagree and love that you are able to watch a movie and surf the net at the same time.

I also had a Surface Pro 128Gb tablet.  The surface pro had benefits of an i5 processor but on the tablet form factor it was lacking.  It was thick, ran hot, and the fans were loud.  Pro's on the surface pro is you can watch the free version of Hulu, watch network videos on their website, etc.

I highly recommend this device.  2K video playback is wow!  You have to see it for yourself.

4/11/15 Update:
I notice the iPad Air sleep function utilizes much less battery power than the Galaxy Tab S.  Will see if there is a WiFi setting on the Tab S to minimize power loss.  Maybe the iPad sleep function turns off WiFi or something.",04-10-2015,04-10-2015

Crushes The Apple iPad Air!","If you haven't seen the screen on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5-Inch Tablet, you're really missing out. It's incredibly vivid, pixel-dense, colorful, and downright gorgeous. Apple's very best displays pale in comparison to this stunning technological wonder.  The pixel density is greater than that of the top-of-the-line iPad Air, and the huge boost in pixel density finally brought the sort of pixel density and Super AMOLED screen to the full-size tablet market that the then-groundbreaking Samsung Galaxy S3 introduced to the smartphone world back in 2012. Just as the Samsung Galaxy S3 wowed the world and crushed iPhone 4S sales, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5"" Tablet is clearly superior to the Apple equivalent. This sweet tablet is thinner, lighter, more sleek & attractive, more pixel-dense, and has a brighter, more vivid, better-looking screen than its Apple equivalent.

The only thing Apple's iPad Air does better is satisfy die-hard Apple fanboys who would prefer to pay way too much for an inferior product. You heard me, Apple worshipers (Yes, I know many angry Apple fanboys will give me one star for my opinion. Says more about them than it does about my review).

While I was a late adopter, buying mine in March of 2015, I do not in any way regret my decision to purchase this incredible tablet. It will clearly be a good purchase even after the next-generation tablets are released, presumably later in 2015. This tablet is a definite keeper. It is blazingly fast, it looks incredible, it is light, sleek, and the display is second-to-none. And since it accepts 128GB microSD cards, its 16GB internal storage isn't really an issue. And now that Amazon is selling it for $50 less than I paid (at the moment of this writing), if you can afford a tablet costing over $300, you'd be a fool to choose anything else over this, unless you REALLY need a 12"" Galaxy Note Pro, or you're smaller, and prefer the smaller-scale Galaxy Tab S 8.4"" Tablet.

You won't regret this purchase, unless you buy into the 'Apple is better even though it's inferior and costs more' hype. Samsung does smartphones AND tablets better than Apple, looks better doing it, and uses their technological superiority to expose Apple's rotten core.",04-04-2015,04-04-2015

Ive had 8, 8.5 & 9 inch tablets.  And then a note 10 inch, and with its plastic stylus.  I thought I has found Valhalla.  So when I knocked my note off my bed, and bent it in such a way, that I could no longer push the volume rocker, or power buttons, I was really in a question.  Should I buy another note, even though it is an OLD technology now, or get this tablet.  This one won the contest, and I am so glad that I HAD to buy this.  Because I would have waited for the next note, if I could have.
But the 10.5 AMOLED display, is just breathtakingly beautiful.  And the fact that it does not have a backlight, makes where you could turn up the brightness.  And still not use as much power.  That is, if you wanted to.  The display is SO very vivid, that any more brightness hurts.
And as far as the stylus goes.  It was the whole reason I has this dilemma to begin with.  The dilemma, about whether to buy this tab, or a note.  It turns out that the Wacom Gen. 3 Bamboo Stylus Solo, is a rubber tipped stylus, which is as slidy as a micro fiber.  I think it is great.
Oh, and as of this date April 1, 2015, I have already gotten the lollipop update.  And boy, it has made the little stutter disappear.  Sure, it might have only been a couple hundred micro seconds, but now it is gone, completely.  And battery life is great.

Pro:
1. Gorgeous display, watching movies on this is awesome and the ipad air is no match for this.

3. Multi windows and Side sync work great.

1. Lag and stutters appear frequently. The GPU has a hard time catching up with that monstrous display.

Pretty gadget. Perfect for the ADD kid with money to spend every ten seconds.,"Five stars for looks. I'm suprised to find myself the old guy telling you it might not be for you.

Well, I finally bought it.  And I ended up taking it back in < 30 days. He asked me if there was anything wrong with it and I said no. He asked if there was anything I didn't like about it and I said ""We aint got that kinda time.""

I'm in my 50s going on 30s and work on PCs all day long. Not office stuff but nuts and bolts applications and database programming.  Electronics is my thing and shopping for the best tablet was my goal. This could be it, but I could not make it any further.

I've been brought to 2010 by my Samsung smart phone. Many apps and still more available.  Quick access to webmail if I need it and internet if I
really, really need it. I draw the line at texting. If I had the Galaxy Tab S I could find the killer app for me. Link it to the phone and I'm cooking with gas.

At the current discount and with the insurance I got away for just over $600. Then it starts.
Free magazines!  No thanks.
No, it's Free!  No thanks, really.
Here take some, it's really free!  Get away from me!

Got a coupon for Wall Street Journal, free for a couple months, see if you like it. Thanks, I will.
No, Wait, first you have to subscribe for a year to get the free part. No thanks, the same deal is available elsewhere.
WSJ is not the only one. Everything you click on takes you off to spend money.

Let's link to the phone.  Oh, you don't have the latest model. Here why don't you order one.
I like my current phone, there must be another way to link.
No, perhaps you can tether it, if you had the tether cord, let's order that.
Cordless tether, from the Google play? other problems.

Read a book! Now you're talking. Sit on the train and skim through a giant book using a slim tablet. Magic Mountain is terrific, a classic. Got the
PDF as a sample for the app. Then just as I'm getting into it I find typos, words are wrong now and then. An alternate translation?
No, I'm informed that PDFs of books now-a-days are not made with much care. I should not expect much accuracy since they are not making any money on old books, just new ones. How silly of me, 16GB, Bluetooth, world satelite calibrated goodness and I'm expecting accuracy.

Stumble into a hot spot outside of home and it starts again. More selling, intruding, persuading. I just need to check this and that, not hit the
mall. And the apps! Could not find serious tools to do more than hold a pajama party (virtual!). The nice tight phone apps look cartoonish in this
size. Fischer Price applications at Bang Olufsen prices.

After another $150 for the screen protection, manicure tools and miniature keyboard I'm typing into a beautiful screen that is trying to be a laptop. I'm sorry, you are not. It has apps just like MS Office! No! They are nearly like it. And what work could I really get done on a sub minature laptop.

Went to see about writing better apps.  Read all about the programming environment for Android. Went to download it and - News Flash - The system is new now. None of what you read applies anymore, all gone, all new environment and ideas. Not even Microsoft does that (often). So go on and Root the device, be a man. Take it down to the very core processors. For what? Once I void the warrenty then I'll find an app to make it useful?

Reality Check: I have friends who show houses and sell what they can't carry around using tablets and that's great. Me, I work in an office at a desk with the important parts in my head. At home I type on real keys at a desk into a real screen. The work is in my head. This thing would have been a ball when I was a kid, wasting my time in front of the TV, but that's all it is, kid's stuff.

So, I'm too old to spend money everytime I turn a page. Too old or busy to endlessly configure useless toys. And way too tired of ads
under every last rock. It felt like I was overdosing on Amazon with every breath, except there was more advertising.

I'm sure those reading will respond with the many apps, ideas and recommendations that will make me wish I'd kept this (beautiful) thing. Please do! And no, I wasn't ticked there were no coupons for catheters. One day I may get one more powerful for half the price (next month) but for now I've just plane had it up to my gums with this advertising machine, its fashionable toy accessories and the endless parade of ever fleeting drival that it demands I endure.",03-19-2015,03-19-2015

If I had reviewed this two weeks ago, I would have told you I *REALLY* liked it, and I would have given it another star. Five stars? No. It simply comes with way too much bloatware for that (2-3 web browsers, two email apps, etc.).

The three stars comes in because of this: In the last two weeks the thing has become wacky. If I run stitcher, or any other audio driven app (hangouts, skype), and then close the app from the home button with a swipe, it still runs. I can still hear my podcast, my call, etc. I have to literally go into the backend and manually force stop the application. The workaround is to ensure I stop the podcast/end the video call, etc. before closing the app, which sometimes helps. On my iPhone however, I can just swipe to end these with no issues. The other issue we've run into is the internet has started getting clunky and slow - regardless of the browser we use. I thought it was our wireless at first, but all other devices in the house run fast (two regular non-apple laptops, my husbands android phone, and my iPhone). To be clear - we do not have a ton of apps weighing own the tablet. It's actually pretty light-duty.

These two things do not totally kill the experience for me. Truth be told, electronics have pro's and con's. I was simply led to believe by massive research that this had fewer con's than others. It's more frustrating than anything else. For what we use the tablet for, and the price we were able to get it at (cheaper because of an amazon promotion we had), we're likely going to keep it.

Overall:
For light-duty tablet users: You should be okay. Just be aware it might get a little wonky sometimes for no discernible reason.
For heavy-duty tablet users with lots of tablets or constant streaming/gaming: You might get a lot more frustrated with these quirks.

EDIT: We ended up sending this back within the return time frame. We bought an IPad and played with both for about a couple weeks. We ended up staying with the iPad and have no regrets. The tablet just kept getting wonkier as time went on and Samsung customer service wasn't super helpful.",03-05-2015,03-05-2015

It's easy to love a new purchase. It's later that you start to notice the flaws in a product. Fortunately I can say that this product is nearly flawless. I use my tablet everyday and it has not exhibited any problems. The display is truly beautiful and its networking is excellent. It never fails to connect o my network. I would like to address the charging issue that some reviewers complained about. It does charge slowly when connected to a USB port BUT if you use the supplied charger it only takes a couple of hours to reach 100% charge. Charging has never been an issue and I find that I can use my tablet for about 2-3 days of light use before I need to put it on the charger. I added a SanDisk 64GB SD card to my tablet. The ability to add this huge additional storage is one of the reasons I went with Samsung. The other reason is the beautiful display. I also am able to back up my storage locally by simply connecting to my Windows computer. The tablet appears as two storage devices, one for internal tablet memory and one for the SD card.
It is sad that I almost did not buy this tablet because of misplaced bad reviews. I have not had screen/operation lag problems. I have not had charging problems. I have not had any networking issues. Mechanically the tablet is stiff and the fit and finish are better than almost any tablet I looked at. I am not bothered by the bloat ware because I have the extra 64GB of storage. I did not buy Apple because I did not want a closed and controlled product. Android gives the user more flexibility. Also I do suggest that the 10.1"" display is the way to go. I never find myself wishing that my tablet was smaller. I am very satisfied with my Samsung Tab S.",02-27-2015,02-27-2015

On the other hand, the photos quality is poor when I compare it to my Sony Xperia Z Smartphone.  I prefer to shoot pictures and videos with my Xperia and look at them on my Xperia.  But when it comes to read eBooks, well this does it better.

I really wanted the Nexus 9 but after receiving four defective units. I thought, maybe, I'll try something else out. I went with the Samsung Tab S 10.5 because of the hardware and brand. I ended up buying one on eBay because it was cheaper.

Screen: (5/5) 2560x1600 Super AMOLED display is by far the best looking display I've seen on any tablet. Blacks are deep and rich. Whites are bright white. The colors have been said to be over saturated and exaggerated giving it a real pop effect, but that's what I like about it. If you don't like the over saturated look, there are other display modes available. I can't stress enough how much I love the display. No back light bleed at all. The different modes are as follow:

Adaptive display - the tablet will automatically adjust the color depending on the situation
AMOLED cinema - the most saturated of the displays
AMOLED photo - slightly less saturated but still has a nice pop effect
Basic - no pop effect here but colors are accurate and clear

Battery: (4.5/5) In mix use of gaming, web browsing, checking emails, youtube and netflix - I can get between 7-8 hours of use and that's with brightness cranked at about 80%. The battery is solid.

Software: (4/5) Android KitKat with TouchWiz (Magazing UX) overlay on top. There is the occassional hiccup now and then but nothing to get alarm about. I don't particular care for the added bloatware Samsung has preinstalled on the tablet. You can't uninstall them. You can only disable them so they are not taking up additional resources in the background.

Hardware: (5/5) Build Quality is top notch. The back is a hard rubberized plastic with a dimple look. It is easy to hold for long periods of time due to being so light. And it's so thin, too. It's just amazing how they managed to pull it off.

Speakers: (3/5) There are dual side firing speakers adorn this tablet. It's great that the sound is in stereo but the quality and volume isn't the best.

Overall: (4/5)

In conclusion, Samsung has done an excellent job of creating a premium tablet that really is capable of competing on the same level with Apple's Ipad. If you are in the market for a high end premium Android tablet, look no further. You won't be disappointed.",01-09-2015,01-09-2015

It was always underpowered, I had to keep clearing apps off to keep it from getting too sluggish to use. I tended to like the smaller 7"" size, but decided I wanted to upgrade to a 10"" tablet. I compared stats to some of the others, and decided to stick with Samsung.

This is an awesome tablet! Plenty of power, amazing display, but most of all it takes a micro SD card, up to 128gb. so many devices any more don't offer an SD card option, which is a shame, and one reason (of several) I'd never choose an Apple tablet.

Unfortunately, the version of the Android OS at the time didn't allow apps to write to the SD card (meaning they couldn't create or delete files expect in their specific installation folder.) They're supposedly going to backtrack on that in 5.0 Lollipop, I hope so, it was a pretty bad idea in the first place. But that wasn't the fault of Samsung, so no stars taken away for that.

This is an amazing device.,"Depending on how you look at it.  I am very early or very late to the tablet game.  I picked up the first generation Kindle Fire and liked it.  I didn't love it because it didn't provide all that much utility and the screen was good but not great.  The Amazon app store was way more limited than the Play store.  Fewer apps worked on it than my android phone.  I had to side load a lot of stuff I really wanted (which all worked fine BTW).  I hadn't touched another tablet since.  Until I picked up this Tab S on black Friday.

All I gotta say is WOW.  I went from model A to Ferrari.  This thing is so fast, fun, amazing, beautiful, capable etc. etc.  I stream my TV to it with a Vulkano device, I surf the internet with a Google Chrome browser, I watch movies from my NAS, I take full advantage of Amazon Prime video.  It does everything I want and it does it well.  I could not be happier.  That is my happy emotional take on the product.  I will skip the technical stuff since the 500 or so reviews before mine have covered that all very well.

I had to have one, so I purchased it and gave my IPad to my daughter. I could not be happier, best tablet out there. Best thing gone with the IPad is the junky keyboard layout. That is just the tip of the iceberg as far as what makes this a better tablet. I can't see what people see in Apple products I purchased my wife an IPad then one for myself should have got a Samsung then, if I only had known and not listened to the hype. The OS on the Samsung is so far superior you can't put it in words. Transferring files using I tunes is awkward and time consuming. There is no need for this with this tablet OS and you can transfer files to the SD card. All the operations are easier and more user friendly. Oh did I say how happy I was with this great Tablet?
The build quality is second to none and very attractive. Samsung should put the effort into accessories like Apple does for the IPad that is my only complaint. The battery life is excellent better than my IPad was.
I guess all I can say after reading some of the major reviews is I can't find anything worth saying is bad. Some reviews say this or that is not customizable,  and I scratch my head, have they EVER even used an IPad which let's you change or customize NOTHING. An IPad compared to this tab looks like it belongs in preschool just compare for yourself. And as I type this review I am reminded how superior this keyboard is to an Apple keyboard, it's nice to once again have all the features on the keyboard oh how I missed the simple little backspace key which is not available on the Ipad.
If you want to impress the Apple geeks get an IPAD if you want a GREAT tablet get the Tab S 10.5 you won't go wrong with the Samsung.

I'm not going to cover tech specs or what ever else some of the previous reviews have already mentioned, below is info most people are not aware of. I believe these offers expire by the end of the 2014 year, so don't forget to grab them asap if you decide to buy a Samsung Galaxy Tab S.

Lets skip the obvious differences of iOS vs Android. Each of these devices offer great things, in a real world application, these tablets let you browser the internet on the couch comfortably or in bed, take and view pictures, watch movies, listen to music, and play games just as good as any of the other flagship tablets currently available. But this one looks way better doing it!",12-23-2014,12-23-2014

The iPad is a great but expensive, and I don't really like Apple all that much = so that left:

I have a Fire HD and like it, but I miss not having access to Google Play, also the HDX 8.9 is smaller than the Samsung and as expensive (Amazon had the Samsung on sale that day), and I like a lot of real estate.

I have always found Samsung products to be well built, and their screens are excellent. The screen on this one (the AMOLED) is nothing short of fantastic. Some people are a bit put off by its being so vivid, but I consider this a plus. It is remarkably light and runs all day on a charge.

I have not found any problems with it at all. Some have complained about the fingerprint reader being to finicky, but this is a trade-off for security - and you can always leave it off or just use a password. The audio sounds good for such a thin box, but since I use bluetooth headphones, it would not be an issue in any case.

Bottom line - I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this one - particularly if you can pick it up on sale...",12-20-2014,12-20-2014

I bought mine while traveling so i over paid and its a 32gb which has pluses and negatives.
As an apple consumer i'm VERY IMPRESSED and have given away my ipads.

PROs:  Screen, battery life (movies 4.5 hr. no wifi no Blue tooth, just wifi and blue tooth about 6 hours of surfing streaming) , blue tooth easily connects to all devices FAST!, processor power, speed, compact, up to date asthetics, micro SD port and ower of wifi reach.

CONS:  no S-pen :(  , no USB port, (must buy adapter for USB), holding TAB S in hand your length wise the back button and menu key are where your thumb will touch, some APPS such as CM security, CM brower are not compatible where as my Note 3 utilizes these apps.

TIPS: Too big for children if holding by hand,  Although no S pen it will handle most stylus pens i've used on the screen, buy the Samsung matching keyboard. Its a bit compat but it locks in place, holds the Tab up right in width and length positions and has long battery life..... so far :)",12-18-2014,12-18-2014

I had an iPad 3 32GB for 2 1/2 years which I sold.

The display is better than the iPad Air's. I put a 64GB Samsung micro SD card in it. Try doing that in an iPad. The ""Recent Apps"" and the ""Back"" buttons make it much easier to use than any iOS device. I can connect it to any Windows PC, it shows up as a USB mass storage device. No more being a slave to iTunes or the few independent Windows programs that allow you to move files but still need iTunes running in the background. There are some apps that are iOS-only but there are actually superior, free Apps on the Google Play store. A free calendar app in the Play Store has the same features as a $20 in the App Store. There are a number of free apps that can access the internal features and sensors in the S 10.5 that are forbidden to iPad and iPhone app deveopers by Apple.

Those complaining about battery life and performance: Turn off all the Apps you don't need that can be disabled; Turn off all unnecessary notifications that can be turned off; If you have lots of Apps see which ones can be transferred to the SD card; Enable ""Developer options"" in ""Settings"" (Google it) and disable the three ""Animation"" settings; Disable S-Voice and Google Voice. I charge the battery every three days or so, it seems to use about 16-17% per day with heavy use. The batteyr life seems to be very similar to that of my old iPad 3.

One negative is that the Samsung Simple and Book covers do not totally disable WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth when the cover is closed unlike the iPad. Although this turns off the display and put the device into standby the three functions are using battery power.  So I just disable the three functions in the ""Quick settings"" bar when I put the device away each night.",12-17-2014,12-17-2014

But the fact that my wife can have her own account with her own apps, signed into her Google account, kinda doubles the usefulness of the device. I see some reviews about bad performance, and chrome runs terribly on this tablet, but if you use the browser that came with it, it is very smooth and responsive. I haven't had any other issues. Every game I tried works great. With the recent deals on this tablet, it is an amazing value. Samsung is usually known for being expensive, but this device blows everything away in it's price range.

Battery sucks and like another reviewer I am constantly closing everything, though this may be an Android fault not Samsung. Apps are draining power for no reason when not in use.

To understand you have to see it yourself. In the dark, you won't even be able to see the screen where it is black, this is because amoled screens don't use any backlight, and you could read alot of ebooks on this thing if you switch to white on black background since all the black pixels is essentially OFF.

Now, the Exynos Octa is not a true Octal-core cpu, infact it's two seperate cpus, one at 1.9ghz and another at 1.3ghz, but only one can run at a time. This is supposed to translate into power effeciency. Although technically this specific Exynos 5420 can support HMP where all 8 cores can be assigned something to do, it is not enabled on these tabs. The LTE version uses a different chipset, the Snapdragon which beats the Exynos model in many ways especially GPU performance where the Adreno 330 outshines the Mali-T628MP6 by a good margin. So if you plan to play games on this thing or want a faster model, then the LTE one is the way to go. So far though, I haven't seen any 32GB in LTE, only Wi-Fi and exclusively only from Bestbuy which is where I got my 32GB Wi-Fi model from. It's also worth noting the LTE version carries a heftier price tag, so you may or may not want to go for that model.

I have rooted mine and installed custom firmware and overclocked and undervolted both the CPU and GPU but it still cannot come close to the LTE one in terms of GPU horsepower. 2.1 GHz on the A15 cpu up from 1.9GHz and the GPU from 480Mhz to 667 Mhz. The boost was very noticable in some games for the GPU, but keeping the CPU at top speeds for long is not really possible even with DVFS disabler and wanam exposed installed to mitigate the downclocking features. My antutu score for this device has reached 40,000 points up from the stock 35,000 or so.

I recommend nova launcher to speed things up too. Also worth noting is that internal memory is significantly faster than memory cards, so you'll want to install your most frequently used apps or games on the internal 16 or 32gb and only put media like videos, mp3 or other things on the SD card. When I checked internal memory was about 64MB/s write vs only 15MB/s write for the external sd card (Samsung 64GB Pro).

It does get quite warm when gaming though, right by the camera in the back. It also takes a while to charge, and uses the smaller USB2.0 connector instead of USB3.0 like some other tablets. There is also a darker colour scheme under the name Charcoal Grey instead of Titanium Bronze available in some markets.",12-11-2014,12-11-2014

Super fast
Screen is its differentiating factor. The colors and clarity are amazing. I watched a movie and could see the pores on someones skin in one shot.
Wafer thin, almost like a cracker. Makes one feel like it should be handled delicately its so thin.
Samsung's UX interface won't let you opt out to run the stock Android interface but I got used to it. If you start deleting all the home pages its OK. It will force you to have one. Otherwise its seems like some Windows 8 tiled BS that can give you a headache sorting it all out.
I learned after purchase the 10.5 version does not have a proximity sensor so you cannot wake it without using the home button. But there are apps to remedy that.
Battery life is good given the power hungry screen.
However, the charge cycle is slower than expected. If you have a Note 3 etc. don't expect the same charge cycle with this tablet as its slower.

It's a beautiful device.  It runs well and you can watch amazon prime movies on it.  You do have to go through a bit of searching to figure it out.  It doesn't run on kitkat without the amazon apps that you do want to get from Amazon.  They  are  free.  Also you can use flash players but you do have to get the apps for that as well, also free.  I did my research before buying so I knew this was the top of the line tablet, including  processing speed and a 3 gig ram (fastest of all tablets)  to be honest,  I am waiting for the android programmers to write a rooting program so that I can store it away.  It is such a great computer and I use go launcher ex on it so it does whatever I want it to.  I have no intention of rooting it for a couple of years when it will still be a great computer but will want to play with other operating systems. Oh and with dolphin browser you can set up a desktop version instead of a mobile browser which makes it accessible for websites not set up for it.  My sons both have Linux computers,  we'll I made them that way. Android is my favorite operating system and look forward to all of apps that come out.  My only complaint is that you have to agree to all licencing in one place.  I do not want Google Drive and can not refuse it.  One reason to root it.  Google Drive does not allow alternative sites of  applications because of the contract.  I like to see what is out there besides Google play.
I changed the rating for two reasons. The first is there is no v way to actually repair the screen without paying close to getting a new one. The glass and the LCD are both offered separately but you have to buy it assembled no matter  how minimal the damage. To fix mine  would cost over $300. It is only cracked glass but it is sealed to the digitizer. So I have a broken tablet that cost about the same to replace. I would have never bought it if I would have known that
The other is that it doesn't have the ability to use a digital stylus. Great screen, perfect for pdfs but you can not annotate. That was the only feature I felt it was lacking before I couldn't repair the screen.",12-06-2014,12-06-2014

From my use, the tablet uses the light sensor as well as the smart cover detector to detect when the cover is opened, this probably uses a good amount of power.

100gb of DropBox for 1 year

The screen is also very nice and appealing to the eye, however this tablet comes with no stylus or anything other than just the tablet plug accessories.

Super Amoled display is a game changer is the tablet arena. It's superior to WQXGA display in color saturation, depth of black color and overall brightness, which make the tablet best suited for watching blu-ray/HD quality movies. Initially Super Amoled was widely used in Samsung smartphones rather than tablet. The first Samsung tablet uses Super Amoled was tab 7.7. I wrote a review on that one when it came out. Unfortunately, the tab 7.7 had very limited release in the US.

Well, let me tell ya...","So one of the reasons I bought the Samsung Tab S is not only that I love Android anything, but I wanted a compatible device with my Samsung phone and also to do school work.  Was told, ""Oh yeah, you can save your documents to the micro SD card.....""  W R O N G ! ! !
I spent the money buying a 64g external SD card, try to save my work, and SCREEEETCH, get error message:  ""list of files saved in external storage may not be displayed due to Android write restriction.  to display the list of all files, select all options under the settings menu.""  So then I can't find the danget setting to see if i could do something to allow storage to external SD, so out of frustration from not finding setting I go to the local electronics store.  Guess what I'm told?  That the word processing program from Samsung doesn't allow storage to the micro SD card, that there have been complaints about it, and maybe in the future Samsung will get the message and allow their program to save word files in the micro SD card.  WWWHHAAT!!!  If someone has figured out how to save word files to their micro SD in their Samsung Tab S,  PPP-leeez let me know!

Everything else about the Samsung Tab S is awesome, but this one thing erks the heck out of me, especially cause I was told prior to purchase, ""Oh yeah, you can save your work in the external SD...."".  So, it means I HAVE to be around internet connection to save anything to the Dropbox, to then edit it from the dropbox, and then save it to the dropbox (again)....you see what a pain that is if I'm not around a wifi connection.  So, how do I do my homework at lunch time, at work, where I have no internet connection.....hmmmmm.  I would say, Samsung, get a grip!, Android restrictions!!!!!!

I just may return the darn thing and fork up the dough for an iPad (I don't like Apple but Samsung may push me that route).

While it looks amazing, there is a quirk concerning its power consumption. Simply put, it will consume a lot more power on a white background, and will consume very little on a black background. This is why a lot of you will experience the battery drain a lot faster while browsing the web (which tends to have white backgrounds) and will see the battery drain a lot slower when watching movies (which tends to have darker backgrounds).

One way to save the battery life dramatically while browsing the web is to turn on some kind of night viewing mode, in which you change the background to black and turn texts to white. Below I outline a way to do this using FireFox and applying a global color theme through an add-on.

1. Download FireFox from the Google play store and install

2. Run FireFox, click menu->Tools->Add-ons, and select Browse all Firefox Add-ons

3. In 'Search for add-ons', type 'Stylish' and select the first item (Stylish). Click 'Add to Firefox'. Select 'Restart'.

4. In FireFox, go to menu->Tools->Add-ons and select 'Stylish', and click 'Manage Styles'. Click on 'userstyles.org'. This is where you choose a color theme that suits your needs.

5. There are many themes that you can choose from. Search for 'global' for instance and you should see some themes that darken the background. Some themes that seem to work well are 'myfavolours - global custom color scheme', 'Midnight Surfing - Global Dark Style' and 'Global Style - Pitch Black Firefox'. Select a theme and click 'Install with Stylish'.

6. To manage the themes you installed, in Firefox go to menu->Tools->Add-ons->Stylish and click 'Manage styles'. Here you can disable or enable the themes you installed. You probably don't want to enable multiple themes at the same time.

7. After a theme is enabled, go to any website and notice how the colors have changed. Because the add-on is making custom changes to every website you visit, it may look a little weird depending on the website and the theme you are using. You can experiment with different themes to see which suits you best.",11-30-2014,11-30-2014

I moved from an Ipad 4 to this because I was absolutely sick of dealing with Apple's iTunes software to put things on my tablet. The Andoid OS gives me exactly the freedom I was looking for on my tablet. It has nearly all the seamless functionality of a laptop or PC without the boot time.

The screen is great. You can set it to adjust to the ambient light around you. The battery life is good enough. Performance is good, but it can be inconsistent by showing a slight hitch when loading new programs. You can use this tablet outside in the sun better than you can the Ipad, but you will still be better off using an eink ereader for reading books outside.

My usage is about 10% web/email, 10% reading ebooks, 40% watching movies and 40% gaming.

Screen:  This is it's best feature by far, 25% more resolution than any iPad, and the ability to use it in the sun, which is not even possible on a ipad, or for that matter 90% of other android tablets. Absolute gorgeous screen that typically has people peering over my shoulder asking which tablet I am using.  Movies simply look awesome on it.

Power/speed: Probably not as snappy as an iPad Air, but it's really close.  I know some users have complained it's a bit laggy for certain things, but it's barely noticeable for me.  Maybe I have just gotten used to it.  But compared to any other Asus/Samsung tablets, it is noticeably faster.

Battery:  Very good when compared with most other android tablets.  I get about 10 hours on 30% brightness just using it for email and web.  When gaming I get about 5-6 hours on the same brightness.  Charging is not the best, it does take about 4 hours to fully charge from about 10%, and you can't use other cables, only the one it came with.

Would but it again......,"I bought this to replace the original nook tablet to use as a reader but also to expand beyond a simple reader. While I am still getting into using more of the Tab's capabilities, I'm liking it more with each use I find for it. I've just begun using the Hanscom Office apps (calc and documents) and find the learning process a bit bumpy - I keep looking for the mouse cursor. However, I do believe I will be able to satisfy my limited needs with this and a few of the other apps. I'm not so much into the social and music stuff but I do find it very satisfying as a Netflix or other video tool. Nice screen size and real decent speakers.

All in all, I am very please with the device, from its size, performance, features and appearance. The only gripe I might make is the battery sorta needs charging daily. I use it typically 3-5 hours a day and have had it warn me once the second day of very low battery. It is not a big thing for me and I did read that the battery was a less than stellar feature before I purchased it.

I bought it with the IVSO keyboard and think the combo is a great match. I would have to say I would purchase it again knowing what I do after having used both for several weeks. So in the short form -  I would recommend it to anyone.

I thought I should give Galaxy Tab S a try. Glad I did. This is a really great tablet, and my initial fears that only some of the apps that are available for iOS will be available for Android were unwarranted - I was able to find the Android versions for almost all of my apps.

The screen is absolutely stunning, mercy, it is gorgeous. I'd say it's better than the Air's. It's an AMOLED screen, which means incredible colors, contrast, and it's definitely not lacking backlight at all.

My thoughts was that if it didn't impress me I would return it.  Upon arrival,  and after package removal, my first impression was positive.  The device itself is much thinner and lighter than the Air.  Upon startup I was impressed with how quickly it became operable.  Initial setup is a breeze, and it seemlessly restored the apps I was using on a Samsung Galaxy Note.  The molex screen is incredibly bright.  The device manages memory well, using approximately 90% so apps load quickly and without hesitation. The finger print scanner works flawlessly,  it's a nice feature.  Android has always been very customizable,  so it beats the iPad there. Having the option of adding storage via SD card is unbeatable,  and that's where Samsung beats apple again. It aggravates me to no end that Apple forces you to upgrade the device if you need more storage.  Svoice has finally matched Siri.  The only area that this tablet didn't beat the iPad is in battery life.  I have to charge this device more often.  It has a power saving mode, and an ultra power saving mode.  The ultra mode puts the screen into monochrome and gives you Internet and email access. This extends battery life tremendously.  If you are somewhere without the ability to charge and need to use it, it's a great feature.  I use it while the device is charging,  and it cuts down on the time it takes to reach full charge.  Multitasking is easy with Android.  If you're using the email app and you click on a link, it divides the screen in half giving you both the browser and the email, this is a really nice feature.  The device has better sound when using the speakers as well.  Placement of the speakers let's you hear stereo separation better.  The cameras, both front and back are a touch sharper than the iPad. If you have a galaxy s4, you can connect it to this device for seemlessly integration.

https://www.amazon.com/Tablet-Stand-Adjustable-Lamicall-Reader/dp/B01DBV1OKY?th=1,33,Electronics,"Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5-Inch Tablet (16 GB, Titanium Bronze)",4.5,4,Mostly great tablet with a few things that could improve,"After destroying my laptop with a cup of water in the spring I have been debating on the decision to buy a tablet or to buy a new laptop. Given the price of this tablet I could have easily bought a core i-5 laptop with much more memory and a huge hard drive and video capability. I also own a Galaxy S4 and so I wanted a tablet that was at least as good in the hardware spec department, and that really limited my choices.  Since the S4 has an 8 core processor and 2gb memory, the only tablet that fit the bill of being better in performance for me was the Tab S. (or the 12.1, but for that much scratch I would have bought a core i-7 laptop instead)

I found what I would consider a good price at a membership club starting with a C. When I unboxed it, I was surpirsed at how thin and light it actually felt, because when you check these things out in the stores they have all sorts of security wires attached, making the tablet feel like it weighs 5 pounds instead of 1 pound. The color is really really nice considering everyone else is only black or white. The rear of the tablet also has a textured pattern and some sort of coating that gives it an anti slip feel. The button layout is where you would expect them to be, but the speaker placement leaves something to be desired. Yes, there are two of them but they are in the sides vs the front, and they really aren't that loud, at least in my experience so far.

I had been used to the HTC Sense OS from previous smartphones, but really like the user interface of my S4. the Tab S is not only as good as my S4 but even better as it has more customization as far as what appears on the home screens. Upates, widgets, etc are all there for you to touch away at. Setup was a breeze and the tablet even started importing apps for me when I logged into my google account. Within a half hour almost every single app and contact that I had was now on the tablet. Everything, including my calendar sync'd perfect. the tablet recognized both my 2.4 and 5ghz wifi bands as well.

Once I started using it I was blown away. The screen resolution and color was absolutely amazing, even at 50% brightness. WiFi streaming my television shows from the Time Warner app was seamless and they appeared just as they do on my 50"" HD plasma.  the Samsung remote control tv app was equally impressive, allowing me to control the tv and cable box with the tablet as well as giving me a full color tv guide to review what I wanted to watch. Apps start quickly and operate like you would expect. One thing that a tablet has an advantage of, besides screen size is the ability to better show and display web pages. I am experiencing more laptop like viewing and performance of web pages than I do with my phone, which makes it really nice while sitting on the couch. I will say I dislike Facebook because the tablet wants to upsize every photo to fit the screen and it looks crappy on the HD screen. I also dislike the fact that I am having connectivity issues trying to connect my phone to the tablet, even though they both have the same OS and are of the same mfg.

There are a few games I started playing now that I have the tablet. Rollercoaster Tycoon 4 is one and has given me some issues, but i think it has to do with the app and not the tablet. I mention this because I also play Battlefield 4 commander on the tablet and have had ZERO issues, whether playing at home or even sitting at McDonalds while at lunch and using their wifi.

Overall I give the tablet 4 stars so far and here is a quick rundown why;

Pros
-8 core processor which provides great speed, though not as fast as the new S5 processor. Go figure.
-Screen resolution and brightness is amazing
-3 gb memory easily handles the applications you have running
-Finger print swipe to open works well
-Included applications work well for the most part.
-Tablet is light and thin and can handle an extra 128gb of micro SD memory.
-Battery life so far is great for me
-Gorgeous and different bronze color

Cons
-Side facing speakers instead of front facing
-16gb of built in memory. Seriously, only 16? Memory is super cheap these days. Just charge us the extra twenty bucks and include 64 in a five hundred dollar tablet.
-Included cover is garbage (my tablet came with a Samsung screen cover which is absolute garbage)
-Only an 8mp camera, where my old model S4 has a 13mp.
-Hard to hold with big hands

The cons are minor complaints overall and I included most only because the tablet was origionally in the five hundred plus msrp. One would think for that kind of scratch you would get specs on par with the newer samsung S5 phone. I would also expect that for the price you get more built in memory and better overall hardware, with the camera being one example. My generation older camera has better resolution. Also, because the tablet is so light and thin I am finding that there is only one way for me to hold it with my large hands. that is, with my hand on the Upper left corner with my thumb wrapped around the front top. if I try to hold it any other way, my thumb will ALWAYS wind up touching some part of the screen, which results in something happening which I did not want to happen. For this reason I am ordering a thicker silicone case protector. I do appreciate how thin and light new products are becoming, but at some point ergonomics does become an issue.",10-23-2014,10-23-2014

 I'm a veteran IT professional who works for a Health IT company. I picked up this tablet with the sole purpose of replacing the laptop I use for work. Having to do IT work in doctors offices and surgery centers means little space to work in very hectic environment. I needed something less cumbersome than my Dell 15"" laptop. At first I was a bit nervous going from a MS windows OS to Android. Turns out this tablet works out better than my laptop for everything I need it to do and more.
 We can talk about how great the screen and sound are, or how awesome games play. There's no surprise there. What I don't see getting mentioned in these reviews are the abilities of the Tab S with a few small accessories. Like purchase a Micro USB to standard USB adapter and now you're able to access any thumb drive or portable HDD.
 My favorite attachment though is the USB Ethernet adapter. The tablet let's you hardwire a network connection. That ability with the right apps, has allowed me to do all kinds of network troubleshooting and mapping, even cable testing.
 I've seen a bunch of reviews and comments that talk about the battery life, I can honestly say I have absolutely no complaints about the life of the device. I'm able to sit with my S5 in sync with the pad speak through the mic and speakers on the pad, while running remote connections through logmein, and split screening my company's ticketing app. As well as slide in a couple min between tickets to play some games. And at the end of an ordinary 10-11 hr day my Tab S is still rocking around 35/40% juice. I have to admit I am a stickler for app management though, I don't let apps just run in the back ground. The Tab S makes app management ridiculously simple to!
 And it never changes temperature, it's the weirdest thing. I can feel my phone get hot after use, but this thing never gets warm! like even slightly. I've joked about it being ""Alien Tech"", but it is a very ""cool"" (Ba dum cha) feature.
 In my line of work I get to see plenty of Apple, Microsoft, and Android products in use. And between the networking, VPN, and EMR software compatibility issues from the MS Surface line. And the countless compatibility issues Apple has being forced to play in the Microsoft sandbox of the business/professional world. I have been very pleased by the performance, capabilities, and compatibility of my Tab S.",10-18-2014,10-18-2014

I was initially concerned that the 16GB internal storage, but it has not proven to be a problem. The only thing I can add (and it is a small issue) is that you cannot format your SD cards as NTFS as they will not be recognized. FAT and ExFAT are fine. This is a minor annoyance as I like to use the cards in my Vizio and Samsung Smart TVs, and neither of them recognize ExFAT so if you are dealing with files larger than ~4GB, you will need to have more than one card.

All the printers are accessible from the tablet including the scanning function of the 5510.  Utilizing the app ES File Explorer, I can access the router back up hard disk, download and upload files and photos. Using ""nearby devices"", we can transfer files and photos, between my TabS, my Wife's TabS, my Galaxy phone, and my Son's Tab4.

I deleted the Hancom office ""viewer"" apps, and through Samsung's free app store, downloaded the full versions of Hancom word, spreadsheet, and power pt. for free.

The rest of the tablet is not so great.

My biggest problems with this tablet come down to Samsung's OS design and placement of capacitive buttons.

Samsung always finds a way to bloat down stock android. The result is that Android is actually pretty laggy here. More so than my Moto X phone. This is probably because of the high resolution screen as well, but it is still slow.

The worst problem are the capactive buttons. They are right beside the home button, and they are very sensitive. What this means is that you can be using the tablet, and you'll accidentally hit one of the buttons. When I use this tablet I end up doing this many many times. There is no way to disable this ""feature"" in the settings without rooting it, which is another like 3 hours of effort.

Decided to give this tablet a shot with an iPad 2 on its last legs.

The first thing you'll notice is how great the screen looks. I've never seen anything like it on a tablet before. The colors really pop and it's almost worth the price alone. The overall design is average.. I've heard some griping over the ""plastic backing"" but I have a case on always so it's never been an issue. It's lightweight and the bronze trim gives it a classier look. Having speakers on each side is nice for streaming media. My main gripe with the design is with the home button being set on the bottom of landscape view. I use my tablets in portrait most of the time and prefer it setup in that manner. It's something I'll get used to but I do tend to accidentally hit the back key frequently. This is personal preference more than anything.

Functionality wise, it has met expectations. The tablet is fast and responsive. It comes with TouchWiz which I understand has it's critics, but I think they've worked out the bugs in that interface from earlier versions. Regardless, I ran some other launchers and they worked great. Adding an SD card is easy and offers up a ton of extra space for apps and media. The camera is fine for a tablet. I'm still waiting for a company to really put their efforts into the front facing camera for better face to face chats.

I have some minor complaints that drop the score to a 4. First is the bloatware which there is a lot of. Samsung seems insistent on using their apps which often have better alternatives on the market. As well as partnering with companies for many apps that you'll never use. This wouldn't be an issue if I could uninstall them, but they don't let you do that. You can disable them, but they'll still reside on your tablet eating up space. This is really minor in the grand scheme of things, but it's a pet peeve of mine and I wish companies would stop doing it.

The lack of USB 3.0 is confusing considering how they've thrown everything else at this tablet from a hardware perspective. While I find the battery life to be good, it would be great to have a more powerful option. I guess I'm a little spoiled by the charging and transfer rates I'm getting on the S5 with this functionality.

Overall it really is a powerful tablet. Perfect for those who consume media or play games. I still think there is a learning curve for Android tablets and would recommend someone be a little tech savvy before purchasing one. And there are still some popular apps that aren't designed for Android tablets and look off. That's not the fault of this tablet, but it's something to keep in mind when purchasing. It's a solid 4.5 stars in my book. Just a few minor issues from this being a perfect tablet.",09-12-2014,09-12-2014

I saw this at Best Buy display and the screen just made me drool. It was INSTANT love.

As much as I love Amazon way more, I had to buy it there because they do not offer the 32GB model anywhere else, as that one is a Best Buy Exclusive only. The system storage uses at least 6GB already, you'll only be left with 10 GB or so with the 16GB model; and Android KitKat has some annoying issues with not being able to write apps onto external storage.

Samsung has way too many models out there, but I'm glad I waited because the ""TAB S"" (S must also stand for SUPERIOR!) model is the top-of-the-line LAMBORGHINI of tablets.

It is fast, but the SCREEN is what completely separates this tablet from all other tablets -- it is ABSOLUTELY MINDBLOWING GORGEOUS. All the tablet screens are put to shame compared to the Galaxy Tab S.

The Galaxy Note models may have an S-Pen (my Note 3 phone has it), but I will trade that pen ANY DAY to keep this GORGEOUS screen. It blows all other tablets away. Anyone with good eyes seeing the display of this screen will be extremely impressed and be envious. iPad's ""RETINA"" display? Puh-lease!!! That is child's play.

You can see the pixels and fine detail and the CONTRAST and DEEP BLACKS are stunning. Yes, the blacks are truly black and the colors SERIOUSLY pop. I'm sure you've heard people say that about other LED HDTV or monitors, but this is a whole new level -- when I say the colors really pop and the blacks are super black on this, this is the REAL deal.

If I had to knit-pick, I would say there isn't much holding area sides, so you may end up touching the display when you don't intend on it (My Nexus 10 has much more holding area); then again, it makes the screen look bigger and keeping the look slim and sexy. Also, it is just a micro-USB port; not USB 3 like the Samsung Note 3.

Don't forget to remove the ugly, distracting white serial number sticker on the back of the Tab S; it almost looks like it shouldn't be removed (I actually wasn't sure myself and kept it on for awhile because I thought that was the only way to identify the model), but it's actually stuck on there so that you can peel it off easily, starting from the right side. The serial number is written on the bottom of the tablet, anyway.

I also recommend getting the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-S-Action-Bluetooth-Mouse/dp/B00N241Y0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung S Action Bluetooth Mouse</a>&nbsp;along with this for more productivity!

I own a Samsung Note 3 phone, so I was already familiar with the multi-window feature; however, it is more useful on this with a bigger, gorgeous screen and I can see myself using it more with this device. Google Maps also looks fantastic as the colors and font is much easier to read and distinguish - I love using this tablet in my car as a navigation! It totally blows away all those expensive cars with built-in navigations.

I am so happy this has a microSD port - with 64 and 128GB microSD cards available now, you can carry A LOT of videos and view them anytime on this GORGEOUS screen. Did I mention how gorgeous the screen on this device is?

The screen on this tablet is a beauty. I wasn't sure of the landscape form factor because of the buttons at the bottom, but since the power input is on the right side, it makes it easier to handle when charging. The finger print scanner does not work on the first try EVER. It usually takes about three times before I get it. The margin for error is very specific, you can't go to fast/slow and must be dead center when swiping. I'm trying to get used to it, to see if I can get better at it, but my patience is wearing thin.

The display is AWESOME! The 4K videos on YouTube look amazing, you don't have to turn the brightness high to see everything, everything pops. I feel like I have a 4k screen in the palms of my hand.

The downside is dealing with some bloatware. Samsung gives you the option of what bloatware to load, but it still comes with more than a few apps. Also, I got the 32GB because I love downloading apps from the Playstore and was running out of room on my 16GB Note 8. Samsung takes up around 6 GB in software, so keep that in mind.

For some, that single con will be the deal breaker.  Initially it was for me until I came to my senses.  Apple's iPad performance reaches a level of quality that Android tablets are held back from by the OS.  Still, the writing's on the wall.  Purchasing this has proved to be money well spent - something I was never quite convinced of with Apple.

I am now enjoying my tablet experience ten-fold over the iPad Air.  It took such a tablet as the Tab S to provide to make me realize that was possible.  iOS may always best Android in terms of quality, but Android delivers the more ""fun"" experience - especially when paired with an incredible tablet such as this.",08-29-2014,08-29-2014

BEST ANDROID TABLET MADE,"First off I am into technology and love to have the latest and greatest.  I have been a fan of both Apple and Samsung products.  I have always liked Macs over PC's and iPad's over Android tablets but phones I have always loved Android.

I was hesitant to get the tablet because of the price but Sears made the decision a lot easier by offering me $225 worth of SYWR rewards points and Discover with Cashback.  I ended up pulling the trigger and was so in love with the tablets screen and quickness that I ended up purchasing another one because I would never see anything like this ever again.  Even better, it was AC technology and my internet is super fast and it makes it more enjoyable.  It helps that I also bought a 32gb SD hard and I love that Android allow you to do this because I essentially have a 48GB tablet for a 16GB price.  Put a lot of movies on the tablet for myself and my son.  eBay has a great deal for cases for this tablet for $8.34 and I recommend buying it because this is a big investment.

The iPad doesn't get much love as of late even though I still like it but seriously Samsung has saved the Android ecosystem with the great features they have on their phones.

I highly recommend anyone looking for a tablet to buy this because I am a very picky shopper and I have never been a big fan of Android tablets until now.

I called Amazon about it and they said if it didn't come by Monday, meanwhile we will refund your same day delivery cost of 5.99. The next morning it was at my doorstep. Using OnTrac isn't the best. Many times they left packages in the rain and come later than it is expected.
Ok, now the tablet. I think its fantastic if you like doing photography as the OLED screen is the most beautiful I have ever seen period. No laptop, no TV, no phone looks as good as this tablets screen. Even brighter than my Galaxy Note 3.
The finger ID was finicky until I learned a little trick. Dry fingers have a hard time registering and hardly worked for me. Then I licked my finger to get it damp and then it worked ALMOST everytime. So keep that in mind if your fingerprints don't register.
The speed is fair for the tablet. Its not a fluid as an Ipad. It does work well enough. I highly recommend this more than an Ipad Air as this have expansion slot for way more space. I put in at 128g micro SD card which only cost $105 from Amazon.

I've been in the Android ecosystem for a while now, but I do get the opportunity to play with other devices as well and I'm tech savvy. Quite simply, nothing else compares. I bought this mainly for reading, writing, coding, netflix/youtube, and a few games here and there.

The first thing that has to be pointed out is just how amazing the screen looks. All the colors are bright and crisp with no discernible pixels, no back-light bleed, no dead pixels, and all the blacks are truly black. Absolutely gorgeous in every respect, it's still stunning me every time I turn it on. Everything I've come to expect from an AMOLED screen. The auto-brightness function works well, it's not blinding at night with the lights off and it's plenty bright during the day. Also, the bezel is a bit smaller than my last tablet (Nexus 10) leading to the Tab S having a larger screen but being smaller overall. I have no troubles holding it without touching the screen, so this change is a welcome one.

Battery life has been excellent, far exceeding all my previous tablets. I've got 6 hours of screen on time in the past 6 days and I'm at 34% battery. As with all OLED screens, darker backgrounds and images will increase battery life; I made it a few days with a black background but the gorgeous display looks so much better with a nice vibrant HD wallpaper. Charge times are also quite acceptable. I haven't quite decided if the ultra-power savings mode is a gimmick or actually useful like on the phones. The apps you can use in ultra-power savings mode are very limited, and it's unlikely to be used to contact someone in a real emergency. Only mild amounts of warmth emanate during gaming sessions, the system doesn't seem overworked at all.

Thankfully the ""Titanium Bronze"" color I chose is not garish or gaudy. I would have preferred a black or even gunmetal option, but I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance. Also the tablet feels really nice in my hand. The back is the same texture as the GS 5 phone, grippy enough to keep any accidental drops from happening but not sticky or unpleasant. The weight is also pleasing, light enough to not cause strain after hours of use, but not so light as to invite accidents. Though I wouldn't complain if they had tacked on a bit bigger battery at the cost of more weight.

There are a few minor annoyances, depending on your viewpoint. Samsung does not make the best software, luckily being an Android system these problems can be fixed. I read quite a few reports of TouchWiz causing problems, so the first thing I did was install a different launcher (Nova). Because of this I have experienced no lag at all, except some browser lag on some websites which you will see in every single tablet on the market. Every action is snappy and responsive, everything you would expect for a tablet of this price.  The menu button is now a recent apps list which I find annoying, yes you can hold it and get the menu button but that only creates confusion with my brand new GS 5 having a menu button and my brand new Tab S having a recent apps button.

There is a little bit of bloatware that comes with the tablet, it would be nice if manufacturers would stop including useless apps that are difficult to uninstall, however they have kept it at a minimum compared to a modern smartphone and you can turn most of them off so they stop using system resources. As a quick example, the NY Times app used 5% of my battery and I never opened it once. You will want to clean up the bloat if you want to maximize your battery life.

Overall, I can easily recommend this to anyone wanting the best of the best.",08-08-2014,08-08-2014

OK let me start with my first observation,  and the thing that separates this from every other Android device: BATTERY AND CHARGING.  The battery does not seem to last 10 hours as advertised,  but it lasts long enough about 8 to make this very useful.  Having said thatm considering the display and quad plus one core cpu, 8 hours is awesome.  It's light, it's well thought out with no sharp edges, corners or buttons protruding to catch on clothing etc.  I bought a few excellent cases from amazon for about 10$ each and a 5 pack of screen protectors for same price so I'm very well prepared.  The tab 4 10.1 inch for just under 300 is the bargain as this is still a bit pricey to basically get a souped up screen resolution for 200$ more.  Yes you get a slightly faster cpu and another core but I have not noticed any difference and yes I have both.  How ever when one realizes that class 10 sdxc card is 40$ and adding the up to 128 gig sd card makes the storage larger as one larger disk vs how my phone is where the phone storage is separate from the sd card.  That means I have a faster, higher resolution display, more affordable tablet than air pad and all of it including cases, memory and tax was under 500$.  A 64 gig air pad is 700 plus tax and I can still put up to 128 gig in this where apple has ZERO upgrade or enhancement capability.

With it, Google accomplished the unthinkable -- widespread Linux use by average home users. Linus Torvalds popularized his kernel with nerds and the enterprise, but the search giant made it accessible for all. Here's the thing though -- the fact that Android is powered by Linux doesn't matter. No, to the average consumer, all that matters is the experience. What lies beneath is inconsequential.

Samsung recently released the Galaxy Tab S 10.5, its newest flagship tablet. The device's closest competitor is the iPad Air -- which is a tablet I love. Besides Apple's tablet, there is really no other product to consider at the $500 price point. So, if you are considering a $500 general-use tablet, the only question that must be asked is -- is it better than the iPad Air?

Boy, what a tough question to answer -- tough, but not impossible. I've been using them both, side by side, for some time now and I have some definitive thoughts.

Galaxy Tab S 10.5 Specs

Network -- Wi-Fi Only
Processor -- Exynos 5 Octa (1.9 GHz QuadCore  1.3 GHz QuadCore)
Display -- 10.5-inch WQXGA (2560x1600) Super AMOLED, 287ppi
OS -- Android 4.4 (KitKat)
Camera -- Rear: 8.0 Megapixel Auto Focus Camera with LED Flash, Front: 2.1 Megapixel
Connectivity -- Dual-Band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac MIMO, BT v4.0, USB 2.0
Memory 3GB RAM, 16GB Internal Memory, microSD (Up to 128GB)
Battery -- Li-ion 7,900mAh (10.5)

Analysis

The first thing you notice upon taking the Tab S from the box is just how thin and light it is. Shockingly, at 6.6mm and 465 grams, it is even thinner and lighter than the iPad Air. This makes it very easy to hold and reduces arm-fatigue. Of course, at this point, we are splitting hairs -- both tablets are really thin and light.

If you are in the market for a 10 inch tablet, the screen should be a huge factor in your decision. For a while, the iPad Air display was one of the best, if not the best. The retina display, while partly marketing-speak, produced beautiful and vivid images. While the display on Apple's tablet is still great, it can no longer be called the best.

The Galaxy Tab S 10.5 offers a 2560 x 1600 resolution, but that is only part of the allure. The real news is the Super AMOLED technology, that recreates the most beautiful colors and imagery. Some may argue that this technology over-saturates the colors -- I must disagree. True, colors are more vivid, but not to the point of creating a mockery by any means. No, it instead treats the user to a more life-like experience.
Where it really shines is in the sun (pun intended). In my backyard on a sunny day, the iPad Air is unusable. It is impossible to decipher what is on the screen, so I must head for shade. The display on the Galaxy Tab S, is a totally different story. Samsung's technologies allow the user to have a better experience under sunlight. This is achieved using sensors that adjust the display to your surroundings.

Much like its smartphones, Samsung has implemented its TouchWiz improvements to the otherwise boring Android interface. When compared to the stock experience of something like a Nexus 10, TouchWiz makes the user experience much more colorful and lively. Things get taken to a new level with this tablet though, as it takes advantage of a tablet-optimized ""magazine"" mode, which I rather like. Don't like it? Install Nova Launcher. It's not a big deal, guys. Android gives you the option to choose.

The iPad does not allow you to easily add additional memory. While you can jailbreak and access SD cards and flash drives, under normal usage that is not allowed outside of photo importing. Samsung's tablet offers a microSD slot, so you can add up to 128GB of additional storage on the cheap. While newer versions of Android are making it problematic for apps to use the card, it will work wonderfully for storing media, docs and any other file you want.

The rear camera on the Galaxy Tab S 10.5 is actually not bad. Should it become your dedicated camera? No. Still, for a tablet, it is quite capable. There is very little noise and shutter is quick. However, the front-facing camera is pretty bad. Pictures come out very grainy, but it serves its purpose as a video-chat camera for services like Hangouts and Skype.

Sound on the tablet is remarkable. While not front-facing like the class-leading Surface Pro 3, there are at least stereo speakers located on the sides, that lend to solid stereo separation. The user can actually make out right and left channels, something that can be lost when the speakers are positioned on the bottom or rear. Watching a movie on this tablet is a dream -- the combination of speakers and display make it the perfect Android-powered media tablet.

Unfortunately, and strangely, the tablet uses USB 2.0 for connectivity. I understand that many people are moving towards the cloud and connecting to a PC is becoming a rarer occurrence. However, why implement USB 3.0 on the Galaxy S5 smartphone, but not on this flagship tablet? What is good for the goose, should be good for the gander, I say.

The Tab S 10.5 uses a mixture of capacitive buttons and a hardware button on the long end of the rectangular bezel. Capacitive buttons are OK on a smartphone, but fail on a tablet. In other words, the hardware home button is fine -- the capacitive ones are the hindrance.

When holding the Tab S vertically, my thumb is constantly hitting these touch-sensitive buttons. It ruins the experience when doing something like reading, as you want to be immersed in the story. Very often, when I relax and get comfortable, my thumb wanders to those buttons and ruins it all. Could this just be a learning curve? Sure, maybe I can train myself not to hit those buttons, but that should not be necessary. You can see what I am talking about in the above photo.

For internet activity, it is a Wi-Fi only affair. This is fine, as I mostly use tablets in my home. If it does leave the house, I simply tether using my phone. The wireless chip in the Tab S is top-notch though, offering 802.11AC. When connecting to my Apple Airport Extreme, the 5GHz band was visible, it connected quickly and was super-fast. Nice!

The iPad Air is a class-leader in battery life, but the Tab S is no slouch. While I did have to charge it more often than the iPad with equal usage, it still outperformed any other Android tablet I have used. On average, I would say it achieved about 10 hours of use between recharges, which for my usage, meant it would be charged about every three days. It would be in standby when not in use.

My favorite aspect of the Samsung Galaxy S5 is the fingerprint reader. I am happy to say that it is equally accurate on the Tab S. However, I find it a bit awkward to use on a 10 inch tablet, when located on the middle of the bottom-horizontal bezel. I would prefer it to be located on the top right of the face, so I can easily slide my finger. This means the fingerprint reader and the button should be separated on tablets. Do I appreciate having it? Yes. Do I use it often? Yes. Is it ideally located? No.

All in all, this tablet is incredible and should be bought although there are some things that holds it back from beating the iPad

That said, it isn't perfect.  You are much more likely to get stranded on android updates than if you had any sort of nexus device.  GPU performance isn't as strong compared to other tablets, due to the Exynos processor.  Once the new snapdragon processors come out, the performance will be thoroughly behind the times.

+ Premium Design
+ Magnificent Display
+ Excellent Video Playback
+ Very Good Music Experience
+ Outstanding Performance
+ Great for Games
+ High Usability
+ Plenty of Accessories

The Bad:
- Some Controls (Sorting of App Tray) Are Hard to Find

Overall:  The Samsung Galaxy Tab S is a premium Android tablet that is a video buffs dream come true.

Background:  I have owned other Android tablets from Acer, ASUS, and Sony, but I wanted the Samsung Galaxy Tab S as a companion device to my Samsung Galaxy S5.

Design:  The Tab S shares design elements with the S5.  While its body is plastic, it does not feel cheap or flimsy.  It is both thinner and lighter than my first Acer tablet, but that was a 7"" model.  Also like the S5, the Tab S has the dimpled back.  The controls are well laid out, and it feels familiar.  To me, it lives up to its paper and has the feel of a premium tablet.

Setup:  Unlike other tablets, Samsung does not specify a specific amount of time for the first charge of the Tab S.  I simply put it on the charger and waited for the battery level to reach 100%.  It was at about 90% after a couple of hours when I went to bed - note it was at about 65% when I plugged it in.  I left it charging overnight, but Im not sure how much longer it took to get to 100%.  There is a firmware update to install after initial setup, but I had no issues with it.  The tablet boots fairly quickly - 20 to 30 seconds.

Display:  You may be wondering, Does the 2560 x 1600 resolution make that much difference?  In a word - yes!  Other than size, this is the biggest difference between the Tab S and the S5.  For a phone, the Galaxy S5 is no slouch by any means, but the Galaxy Tab S has eye-popping wow-factor.  I switched to the wallpaper to the one with the Ferris wheel, and it looks amazing.  Text is sharp and crisp, and web pages, Flipboard, email, and almost everything look great.

Video:  So whats the best way to take advantage of that magnificent display?  Moving watching is a sport.  And when it comes to movies, this is the tablet.  Netflix, YouTube, or your favorite app for watching your Ultraviolet collection are *the* way to showcase that screen.  You just might need to call in sick so that you can binge watch your favorite movies and shows.

Music:  While the Galaxy Tab S is not a boom box or stereo, its speakers are more than serviceable for private listening.  Headphones improve sound if youve invested in a good set.  If you are looking at a premium tablet, you probably have premium headphones to go with it.  Amazons Prime Music is a great way to consume your music, but it is one of a multitude of options.  When you have the ability to add up to 128GB of storage through microSD cards, you can source your music just about any way that fits your budget.  The good news is that you are covered.

Games:  The Galaxy Tab S also has great support for games.  It has plenty of processor and memory to handle intensive games like Riptide GP2, and once again, the display shows off - it really cant help itself.  Are Plants vs. Zombies or Angry Birds more your speed?  These are here too with one exception.  There is an issue with Angry Birds Epic that seems to be unique to the Galaxy Tab S (and this is the only reason I still use my ASUS MeMO Pad FHD).  Other than that, it is game on!

Usability:  As I mentioned in design, the controls of the Galaxy Tab S are well laid out and intuitive to use.  The user interface is almost identical to that of the Galaxy S5, and I know get why iPhone/iPad people are so locked in.  This is the first time that Ive had a phone and tablet that were so harmonious.  TouchWiz is a fine skin over stock Android.  It doesnt make me do backflips, but I don't hate it either.  Navigation and customization are smooth and straightforward.  The Galaxy Tab S is highly customizable, and it will delight power users looking to tweak everything to the nth degree.  The only thing I would have liked to be easier was switching the app sorting to alphabetical.  This was hard to find, and the default sorting drove me crazy.  Thats as close to a complaint as I can get.

Accessories:  Samsung has distanced itself from the pack in the Android world, and there are benefits to going with the front-runner.  The first among them is the variety of accessories.  I bought a Samsung Book Cover designed for the tablet, but you have other options already.  Belkin I know has a case, but others will follow soon.  Accessory makers love the front-runner.  If you want a keyboard, Samsung makes a keyboard cover specifically for the Galaxy Tab S.  However, once again, there are other choices.  My generic Logitech keyboard for Honeycomb tablets works just fine, but even Logitech already has a keyboard case available.  I would even go so far as to say that the Galaxy S5 could be thought of as an accessory with the SideSync app.  It is a snap to mirror your Galaxy S5 on your Galaxy Tab S and have control over it.  If you are looking for other accessories, you should expect to find them for Samsung Tablets.

Overall:  The Samsung Galaxy Tab S is a premium priced tablet that delivers a premium experience.  The classic question will be, Is this an iPad killer?  The think that is the wrong question.  My wife is an iPhone/iPad user, and I played with both of these devices before upgrading my Android devices to the Samsung line.  While both the iPad and Galaxy Tab S are both premium tablets, they delight users in different ways.  The iPad is for people looking for an easy it just works experience who also don't worry about high levels of customization.  Android tablets are about freedom and customization.  Both tablets have very similar core capabilities.  It really comes down to preference.  If you are sold on Android, don't fear the investment in the Samsung Galaxy Tab S.  It is simply worth it.",07-08-2014,07-08-2014

The very few niggles I have already have been expressed by others.  Namely, there can be an occasional lag.  I don't know why.  In addition, the screen can be a little overly distracting because of all the non-icon stuff on there.  I prefer a screen with icons.  That's it.

I had my Tab S for 9 days and in that time I experienced why this tablet was years away from even a slight comparison to the iPad. To be clear, I am NOT a fan of Apple products.

First, the screen is beautiful. The colors on images and videos pop right out. It's an eye catching experience just looking at the technology of an Amoled screen. Size and weight are also perfect but that is where the positive attributes end.

First, I travel quite a bit and this tablet was for movies on the plane, reading books and magazines and catching up on email. You cannot access or play your Amazon Prime library as Amazon only supports Amazon tablets for downloading and playing movies. At least on the iPad you can play your Prime movies. Not on the Tab S, you are just dead in the water. You can however access Flickster movies and save them to Dropbox, which works well.

After viewing movies, I noticed images and videos were blurred from frame to frame and the darks were very distorted. I tried changing the display setting but nothing worked. When reading web pages or books and magazines on the first few pages would be in view and others were blurry. Nothing seemed to correct this either. I brought my Tab S into Best Buy they were aware of this issue and had seen it on a few returns. So in other words, nothing you can do to correct it.

The camera is great and pics are crisp and clear. For me, a camera on a tablet is a bit useless but I was impressed with the clarity of images.

Now to the big issue which caused me to return my Galaxy Tab S. Latency and Lag. If you are clicking on an app, using the back button or just navigating from task to task, you will find yourself waiting for the tablet to catch up to you. For has powerful as this thing is in terms of Specs, it is slow and locks up quite a bit. It is frustrating because it happens all the time and is not isolated from one area to another. This was the back breaker for me. Not to mention no access to Outlook for email when the Samsung email client will not sync Outlook sub-folders and is outdated. People told me to download 3rd party apps to make email work. That makes no sense. It works on the iPad, Surface, Google and Asus tablets without a 3rd party app so why is Samsung so far behind in technology?

I almost forgot, Battery life is 6 to 7 hours in real time use. Where they are coming up with 9 to 10 is amazing.

All and all, the Galaxy Tab S is a huge disappointment. Sure the screen is nice but over a short period of time you start to realize that everything else is below par. I would not recommend this tablet to anyone especially with the huge price point.",07-05-2014,07-05-2014

For example, I don't use Netflix but it won't allow me to uninstall it without root. Fortunately, there's an option that allows me to disable most of the preinstalled apps and got rid of the lag issue. Well, lag and stutterness aren't completely gone but they were sure reduced by 99%.

Ive always wanted to replace my iPad with an android tablet especially one made by Samsung. Almost all my electronics that I own are made by Samsung, except for my iPad Air and Apple TV 2. This tablet is an improvement over the Tab pro which was released just 6 short months ago. I kind of wish Samsung had just waited longer and released this tablet instead of the tab pro.

Whats new and improved:

The tab s feels much better built over previous Samsung tablets Ive tried. The previous tablets had a much more plastic feel to them and make clicky sounds when holding them. This one feels nice in the hand with the nice grippy material and also looks more higher end.

Touch wiz is more simplified and faster.

This tablet has 3gb of ram, which is 1gb more than the tab pro.  Its much faster now and multitasking is smoother. More apps can run in the background and fewer refreshes in apps and on webpages.

Improved screen quality since the screen is now an AMOLED, its brighter and has better battery life. The screen is also larger now at 10.5"" when compared to the tab pro which was 10.1"".

This tablet has a built in finger print scanner. This is a very handy feature to have for added security without having to type in a PIN, password or pattern. Too bad this feature hardly works. I had to slide my finger a good two to three times for it to register and unlock the screen for me. No other tablet on the market has this feature currently including the iPad Air. I am glad samsung added this feature but it needs work.

Ultra power saving mode can greatly increase battery life especially when it's very low. Although it turns the screen into black and white and only allows you to use a few selected apps. I really don't see how this is that handy on a tablet, but, is super handy to have on your smartphone like it is on the s5. Still nice for samsung to include this.

Side Sync is an built app that allows you to access your Samung Galaxy Smartphone remotely while on the same wifi network. You can take calls, read/reply to texts and transfer files from you tablet. This is very handy feature. I thought initially it only worked on the newer S5 but I was able to download the app on my S4. Sadly I couldn't get the feature to work with my s4.

The tab s also has a new private mode which allows you to hide files, pictures and videos. The private mode is also incorporated with finger print scanner so that the hidden files only show when using your finger to unlock the screen.

What still needs improvement:

The placement of the menu and back capacitive buttons still comes in the way and gets accidentally pressed when using the tablet in portrait mode. I guess you could just use the tablet in landscape mode all the time.

The tablet ecosystem in the google play for 10"" tablets is very limited. There are still many apps that just don't take advantage of this tablets larger, higher resolution screen or aspect ratio. This is not the case with iPads and one of the main reasons why I still prefer my iPad Air. Some of the apps cant even run in landscape mode which is what this tablet is meant to be used in. Here is just a small list of the tablet apps that are not optimized yet: Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Yelp, Dropbox, Dictionary, Instagram, Epocrates, Medscape, WebMD, Zedge, Tapatalk.

I still found there to be some lag from time to time. At times the tablet was just really fast and other times it was lagging for no apparent reason. I installed nova launcher and disabled many samsung and google unneeded apps to make it slightly better.

I also found there to be issues with the network connection. The tablet always seemed to be connected to my router but from time to time I experienced issues with it loading pages or refreshing apps. I had no issues like this on any other device on my network. So I suspect it was the tablet only that this issue.

The screens responsiveness was not up to par with other touch screen devices I own and tried. At times I would have to press the screen muilitiple times before it would respond.

The watch on tv remote seemed to give me very odd and weird information. It would show me content that had nothing to do with my cable provider or the channels I selected. I took a look at the same app on my Samsung S4 and the information was totally different. The information on th s4 app was correct. Maybe a future update to the wach on app on the tab s will improve the results for me.

Although battery life is much improved in this tablet. Its still not as good as what Im getting with my iPad Air. With the tab s I was getting about 8-10 hours of screen time mostly from surfing web pages and a little youtube streaming. With the brightness at about 30% and some notifications enabled. With my iPad Air I can easily get 15 hours with the same type of usage and settings. If I really push its limits I can get about 18 hours of screen time on my iPad Air.

Samsung Tab S vs iPad Air

The tab s clearly has better hardware and specs. The screen is so much better than the iPad Air. The tab s has higher resolution screen and more pixels per inch than the iPad Air.  The iPad Air's 9.7"" screen is smaller than the tab s which is 10.5"". The screen also get much brighter is great for outdoor use. The screen also gets much dimmer which is better for night reading.

The placement of the speakers on the tab s is much better. When watching a video you get the nice stereo effect in landscape mode. With the iPad Air the speaker are not placed on either side of the screen, so you only get the stereo effect when using the tablet in portrait mode. I did find the speakers on the iPad Air to have more bass in them. Both tablets had just as loud speakers in my opinion.

The Tab s had micro sd slot so expanding storage is cheap and easy. It accepts cards up to 128gb. But the use of card is limited quite a bit now since the kitkat update. Not at appps can run and be stored on the sd card. Also apps iSyncr for example which is an app that allows you to transfer your music wirelessly from your PC to your tablet/phone, only works when connecting your devcie via usb to your pc. Or you have to root your device to gain full rights over your own sd card.

The tab s has only about 10gb of available storage out of the box. There is no 32b version available right now and also no choice of getting more storage. With an iPad you can get up to 128gb storage, but storage is expensive at $100 each step up.

The tab s has included gps. In order to get gps with an Ipad you have buy an LTE enabled model which is another $120.

The tab s can run two apps side by side at the same time. Not all apps are support with this feature, but its very handy when multitasking. The IPad Air cant do this.

The tab s has the watch on tv app and a built in IR blaster. Makes it easy to control your home entertainment system from your tablet. The iPAd AIr doesnt have this feature.

Overall the tab s is nice improvement over the last version. My main reason in sticking with my Ipad Air is the app support. I also prefer the 4:3 ratio that the Ipad AIr has. It looks great in portrait mode for reading and browsing web pages. I don't like the tab s in portrait mode it just isn't functional that way. If you use your tablet mostly for watching videos and playing games, I would say the tab s is the better choice. Also if you use your tablet alot outdoors than the tab s is better since it gets brighter. But the Ipad does have better battery life, better support,higher resale value, Airplay, Multitasking Gestures and more accessories. Also the Ipad Air will updates much quicker. I have no idea how long the Tab s will take to get android L. Probably atleast a good 3-6 months once its publicly released. Where as the Ipad AIr will get iOS 8 the day it comes out. My only main gripe about my Ipad Air right now is the lack of ram, at 1gb it has to refresh apps and website frequently. The tab s is better for multitasking. You cant go wrong either way. They both are great tablets. But the tab s is more versatile and has better value.

Update: Just wanted to add a few things I missed in my initial review. The tab s has the faster wireless which is ac when compared to the iPad Air which does not have ac wireless. This will only be an advantage if you have an ac wireless compatible router.

The tab s takes a little bit less than 7 hours to fully charge. Versus the iPad Air which takes a little bit over 4 hours to charge.

Also the tab s does not have NFC capability.",07-03-2014,07-03-2014

The screen quality just makes me wish more than Sony didn't switch to IPS on the latest PS Vita, and hopefully the Galaxy Tab S will encourage the other players especially Apple and Microsoft to offer the AMOLED option in future products.

so far, so good -- the screen image is very tight, very nice and the size makes webpage reading easy. the camera is only so-so on low light, but i have cameras for low light and i'm not selfies-izing my life anyway. very quick, noticeably from my galaxy 4 7.

only negative is that it's so large and i don't have a pocket for it and will have to carry a bag, i think. i'm looking today at the timbuk2 small classic messenger.

I got this for an upcoming europe trip -- i should say that i don't and won't have a cell phone, so i'm strictly dependent on hot spots for connections when i'm not home. and, using this for reading a QR code at a bus stop in some town i might visit seems to me might be a little awkward; i guess i'm wondering how practical this really is. it's lighter and cheaper than a laptop, can do handwriting to font conversion in most text-input apps -- gmail for instance, and is big enough to watch movies on -- the resolution actually makes small-screen viewing sort of viable as movie --

and, i suppose i'll get a bluetooth keyboard of some kind for writing essays and the stuff i do, when i'm travelling -- or, maybe even at home in bed... my expensive powerbook G4 mac broke at the electrical input so all i have is desktop pc these days... and, that would be a life-style changer: casual writing modes and how that would effect writing style. still, it's not like i'm going to be ( i hope ) burying my face in this machine every other moment, the way you see people doing now -- watching a screen while there's the most beautiful light out and the bus is driving past forests which look like they're out of disney.

it's just the second day i've had this, though, and what do i know...? But, anyway, Amazon was great! I pre-ordered, and they said they'd send me an email when they could ship, and the next thing i know it's in my mailbox on the 27th -- just as i was wondering how long before they had it in stock. Amazon is always cool.",06-29-2014,06-29-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Tablet-Stand-Adjustable-Lamicall-Reader/dp/B01DBV1OKY?th=1,33,Electronics,"Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5-Inch Tablet (16 GB, Titanium Bronze)",4.5,4,Superior gadget,"Everyone knows all the pro's, so let's look at what they messed up:

Not much.  Just the same pesky stuff they've been messing up for years (read engineers isolated in a vacuum lol).

An inherent design issue with these slab-tabs is grip.  Samsung chose to ship this without a cover, and they make it extremely hard to get one in the first 30 days.  They also did this on all of their high end phones such as the Note series.  Without a cover, it's a slip/drop accident in the making.  Yes, you'll drop it, and yes you'll have finger prints all over the screen trying to hold on.

IMHO the 3rd party warranties that are being pushed are another accident in the making.  Never hear too many good outcomes about these guys, and plan to be without your Tab for a while.  I noticed in the reviews that most owners just get their old one back in the same condition, but now officially certified broken.

Remember this thing has no cellular radios.  Not that I really want one.  If I need wifi while on the road etc, I just mobile hotspot my cell (free with ATT nowadays @ 20GB it's about time).  They also ignored texting with this device, but there's a few downloads I'm going to try.

A lot of apps are not ready for this amount of hi-res screen real estate.  But they're getting there.  Some just look sloppy, and a few will core/quit.

The multi-window thing is not much more than work in progress.  It only works with a few apps, and then it seems silly.  I'd rather the tab itself speed up foreground application switching, through cache etc. than a failed attempt at true windowing.

Buttons.  Menu isn't menu.  The home is now on the side when you use it up/down.  And without a case or a grip, you'll always be hitting some button that will take you into some other part of the world.  Get used to using your left hand for back, home, and get used to using your fingernails to hang on.

The fingerprint reader is not all that hot.  It doesn't work half the time, and will time you out for a full 30 secs after 3-4 failed tries.  I just turned it off.  That was one feature I really thought I'd like and could use, but in practice it's just not that useful.  A old-timey screen swipe is still king of the unlocks.

Performance is ok, but it won't knock you off your chair.  But ok is good enough in this case.  Not sure if the 8 core processors that are being used for the non-US units perform any better, but I would imagine they would.  Main issue you'll experience is a small lag from one screen or app to another.  Sometimes it can be a second or so.  Not much really, but do it 30x and you'll find yourself waiting a surprising amount of time overall.

Samsung/Google STILL does not have resizable icons - even on Android 4.x.  The icons are circa-2008 and are huge.  The screen is so hi-res, you could shrink your icons down to 25% of their concreted-size and still be very visible and useful.  So if you want to really customize your UI, you'll have to go with another launcher.  I use Go-Launcher (have for years).  Now I've got 10 icons across, and about 15 rows down.  With text.  And the hot-icons at the bottom are also customizable.

In fact while I'm at it, this whole stupid touchwiz thing has just got to go.  It's a static, pre-configured UI and not even worthy of a tab of this caliber.  Look guys, put your development efforts into making Android a full blown OS rather than re-arranging the icons every release for each device then calling it ""the new TouchWiz"".  Team up with one of the launcher guys and make it useful.  Windows and IOS are kicking your butt here.

Some of the *free* software like Dropbox is surprisingly useful.  But to get dropbox to work, you'll have to refer 5 friends, install it on 2 other computers and the like.  More fine print.  And read it carefully if you're making your purchasing decision based on free s/w as they all have some little kink like that.

Now charging and batteries.  First you MUST use the included charger and cable.  It will not charge with a 3rd party micro USB cable, or a longer one.  It will not charge with another USB port.  It will charge while connected to my iMac, but not a Thinkpad.  And it still takes forever to charge - like 4-5 hours at the shortest.  Now in all fairness since it's new I'm banging it pretty hard, and killing the battery in about 5-6 hours of use time.  The sleep mode keeps all the wifi/BT stuff alive, not sure how to put them to sleep also but maybe you can.  Not sure it matters as that huge screen is the highest power drainer.

And no, you can't swap out the batteries like you can on the Notes or S3-4-5.  And you've never been able to swap batteries on any Apple IOS product.  Heck, iPad/iPhone still don't have a memory card slot after 10 years of incessant screaming from their customers.  Actually since Steve died they haven't had much of anything new have they - but that's another story.

Ok, if you've read this far you know all the annoying stuff that's still not fixed or well conceived.  Believe me - none of this annoying stuff is a show stopper for this unit.

Why?  Because the ONE thing that we use the most, and the one thing we've tossed the most rocks at Samsung about - the screen - is by far the best display of about any device out there.  And it's better than almost all computers sans the new 4k displays.  From our incessant screaming for years for 1) replaceable battery 2) stereo speakers 3) memory card slot 4) a super-hi res screen 5) fingerprint login and 6) a thin bezel, out of the 6 they fixed 3 or 4 pretty well.  Not bad.  LG, Sony and Apple take note and turn up your hearing aid.  (Oh - yes there are two speakers on this thing left and right that somehow did not make the specs list).

Samsung always waits to see sales figures before they make cases and keyboards.  So you'll wait as nobody else has them either.

So for the $$, I felt I really got what I paid for.  I reassure myself every time I turn it on and it jumps out at me.  And everyone around me hangs over my shoulders to see.  Yea, it's that good",06-29-2014,06-29-2014

Update- 13 May, 2015 Still working without issue.

Update- 23 May, 2014  I am still satisfied with the box.  It is still running without significant issue.  I give it a double-plus-good rating.

Update- 29 January 2014 The box has been running everyday, recording about 6 shows a week, and a fair amount of time-shifting too.  It is sitting on top of a Satellite receiver which is warm on its own.  The box is still working without issue.

If you decided to buy this- read my review first anyway, I promise I have covered many details that are not in the manual. Details that will drive you nuts until you figure them out on your own.

For the price this is a remarkable little box.  Overall everything is simple enough that you can unbox it, hook it up, and have it running in a few minutes without the manual- which is actually good because the manual does not have any set-up instructions.  On page 8 there is a wire connection diagram- some people may find this useful but most will probably find it more confusing than helpful.

The remote is basic, and barely meets the requirements.  Some keys are marked with icons we are familiar with, others lack those icons, namely the PLAY, PAUSE, and STOP keys. The keys are labeled clearly, they are just missing the familiar icons.  The remote is a fairly narrow beam IR, so you can't expect the same performance as some of the high-power broad angle IR remotes (like DirecTV) or the be-anywhere performance of an RF remote.  Just have a clear line of site within 25 feet and 30 degrees. The box has independent hardware keys for Power, Menu, OK, VOL -/+ and Channel -/+.  The box also has a display that shows channel numbers- however these are the numbers of the memory positions that the box has stored the scanned channels into- these are not the actual broadcast station numbers.

(Added 29 January 14) I have replaced the remote with a ""learning"" universal remote.  By ""learning"" I mean the kind that you use the source remote to teach the universal remote what to do when you push the keys.  You can program any key function into any key- which makes using this box a lot better.  The universal works so much better, I can't emphasize it strongly enough.  The original remote really started to annoy me.
(Added 23 May 14)  Some people have asked about ""Universal"" remotes.  Most ""Universals"" get programmed by telling the remote a code that allows the remote to ""emulate"" the original manufacturer remote.  Unfortunately I haven't found any ""Universals"" with a Viewtv code. I've heard that a certain high dollar brand might work- but I'm not trying to spend twice as much (or more)on the remote than I did on the box!

  Over-The-Air broadcast viewing works as expected.  The digital OTA(Over-The-Air) tuner is slightly more sensitive than the tuner in my TV.
(Added 23 May 14) That means that at my house with an amplified rooftop antenna pointed directly to the broadcast antenna location I get a few more channels on the box than I do with the antenna connected directly to the TV.  OTA reception has a lot of variables.  I live less than 10 miles from the broadcast site, but I am in a terrain shadow (I am behind some big hills.)  The key point I can make is that this box tunes all of the broadcast stations available in the area- my expensive TV's tuner doesn't do that.

The video quality is every bit as good as I could expect.  Using HDMI connection looks as good as expected, using composite cables also delivers a good picture.  Using the built-in RF modulator to output over channel 3 or 4 doesn't work with modern digital tuners- I no longer own an old TV with an analog tuner so I can't test how this works.  Under MENU/ Channel Search/ Modulation you can enable ""Loop through"" which will allow you to watch one channel using your TV's digital tuner and record another using the box's tuner- you won't need to use a splitter inline before the box.

  The menus are responsive enough- they are not instant fast, but I have seen slower on big-name boxes.  Pressing the OK key during regular viewing will show you the channel list.  You can edit your channel names under MENU/ Program/ Program Edit.  If you get bored there are games like Tetris, Snakes, and Reversi- also found in MENU/ Program/ Game

  The EPG (Electronic-Program-Guide) is decent.  Since EPG is embedded in the ATSC broadcast signal (along with time data) I find it amusing that the box displays EPG info even though none of my TVs do.  That being said- if you are familiar with cable and satellite on-screen program guide be prepared to be disappointed- so manage your expectations- there is a reason that Tivo has a subscription fee.  This is not Tivo, but it does provide an onscreen guide of upcoming programming and the ability to set scheduled recordings with just a few clicks.  The scheduling functions are basic, but you can set daily or weekly repeating schedules. It will warn you and prevent you from setting overlapping recordings.  I feel the most obvious function missing is EPG full grid guide, the program list is displayed by channel.  You can't see what is on multiple channels in the same time slot.  Be aware also that viewing the guide for a channel actually changes to that channel, so there is a limitation here.  If the box is in time-shift, playback, or currently recording it will not allow you to go to the EPG. So make sure you have scheduled your recordings before the box starts a scheduled recording.

(Added 23 May 14) SO far my single greatest complaint, and honestly it is a minor annoyance, I wish it allowed setting a label for a recording when setting up a scheduled recording.  Scheduled recordings are labeled by channel name and timed/date.  It is possible to re-label the recording AFTER. So I keep a 3x5 card handy to remind me what shows I record by channel, time, and day.
(Added 29 January 14) I've had recordings fail with scheduled recording if I didn't set at least one minute difference between the end of one recording and the beginning of the next.  I've found that the least amount of key strokes to do this is change the start time to 1 minute after. It seems that every show starts with a review of previous episodes anyway...
Once I started using the 1 minute after method it hasn't failed a recording.

  I plugged a 128GB USB flash drive in and tested the time-shift capability, it works as expected.  To start time-shifting you press the PAUSE key- you will get the message ""entering time shift, waiting""- then press the PLAY key.  The manual does not describe this correctly. While time-shifting the OSD shows on the bottom of the display, press the EXIT key to hide the OSD, press the INFO key to recall it.

(Added 29 January 14) Use the biggest USB Flash Drive you can afford.  The video format at full HD runs nearly 7Gb per hour.
If you had one of these in the living room and the bedroom, you can easily pull the USB storage out of one and stick it in the other to watch shows you've recorded.  Call it the low-tech-hopper.

  One detail I find unusual is that while fast-forwarding during playback of a recording there is no OSD showing relative position in the playback.  While the box is recording you will have a recording OSD in the top left corner of the display- press the EXIT key to hide the OSD, press the INFO key to recall it.

 On many laptops I have to use 2 usb ports to power an external harddrive (spinning disk type), but this box provides enough power through just the single USB port. The drive had multiple partitions both FAT and NTFS- all partitions show up.  You can adjust the time-shift buffer from the default 1GB by increments of .5 GB up to 4 GB, you will find this setting under USB/ PVR Configure/ Record Device/ Timeshift Size.

(Added 29 January 14) Use a flash drive.  The box will time-shift to a external hard disk drive, it will play back your movie collection too, but I have had it fail scheduled recordings with the hard disk drive- even when I observed the 1 minute after rule mentioned above.  After a little experimentation, and time staring at the box, and listening to it in operation I believe it is due to the time it takes for the hard-drive to spin up.  When the scheduled recording kicks in the box spins up the hard-drive, but if the hard-drive speed is a little slow the box detects that the drive is not ready so it aborts the recording. You might have a different experience with a better external hard-drive. My recommendation is to stick to flash media- with no moving parts or spinning disks it gives better assured performance.

  Pressing the USB button on the remote will take you to the USB menu, then select the PVR icon and look for a folder called HBPVR to find your recordings.  The recordings are named according to station call-sign/ date/ time.  A menu appears across the bottom of the display that indicates which keys on the remote do what function. You can delete /rename files from this menu. To  play a recording you have a few options.  You can press the OK key to select the file and it will start playing the recording, or you can press the PLAY key, you will be presented with a choice to ""StartResume"", press the OK key to resume a previous playback or press the EXIT key to play from the beginning.fast-forward in the preview and see the relative position as it fast forwards, then press the HOLD key to go full screen.

  The video files played without issue on my Windows 8 laptop using VLC.  I've been building my own HTPCs since TV capture cards have been available.  I've been using DVR/ PVR appliances and applications since the first Tivo and since DirecTVs original UltimateTV.  I've used MyHTPC, MythTV, BeyondTV, just to name a few.  I currently subscribe to a satellite provider and use their whole home DVR,  It is a good product- but for a subscription free system this device has me impressed.  It performs as well as most mentioned above, and better than many.  It has a few shortcomings- but nothing that I would consider a deal breaker.  The only detail unknown (and only time will tell) is how well the box holds up.

  Overall this box performs solidly, far far better than I expected for such an inexpensive purchase.  This box doesn't have some features that I would like to have:  grid EPG, more than 1 USB port, ethernet or wifi, dual tuner recording, capability for an internal hard-drive.  These are nice-to-haves, and most of these features are available on other units that cost 3 to 5 times as much.  At this price point- the only reason you will be disappointed is if you have unrealistic expectations.  I would highly recommend this product for anyone who has OTA television available.",12-16-2013,12-16-2013

Homeworx captures many channels but not all. It is not very sensitive, even with signal boosters. After watching some tv shows for about 1/2 hour,
viewtv started to reboot. I noticed viewtv is getting very hot. The ""antenna in"" gets so hot it can burn your finger. I suspect there is not enough heat sinks and definitely no fan. After unplugging and letting it cool down, it started to work again. But only for about 1/2hr to 45min. Then it starts rebooting over and over again.

Some notes:

The RF output can be set to channel 3, 4 or loop through.  The latter presents the antenna signal to the output port.  I figured it was just as good as using a splitter on the line, but I was wrong.  Using the RF out for an antenna input to another tuner gives poor results, with a very degraded signal.  I put a splitter before the box instead, and that works file.

You can set the box to produce antenna power.  It produces 5V DC on the wire (center positive).  This will work for some indoor amplified antennas, but any discrete antenna preamp that I've seen requires a higher voltage.  It won't power the RCA TVPRAMP1Z (which uses 9V DC).  I tried.

Sometimes the audio and video gets a bit out of sync.  Retuning the channel helps.

The LED display shows, for example, C005 to indicate that it is tuned to the fifth channel in memory.  It's basically useless.  The channel shown on the TV screen is the actual logical channel number.

The box will not tune analog channels.  Of course your TV can tune analog channels regardless of its vintage.

If you get bored with television, you can play Tetris and a few other games, through the remote.  I'm not sure why they even added this.",09-18-2016,09-18-2016

After opening the box I found that the package contained instructions that were easy to follow with little difficulty in interpreting the directions.  Although written well, I did find that there were points in the instructions which left me in a position to interprete minor parts.  Assembly is not required other than a couple of cords which must be connected to the box.  After beginning the programing I found it to do exactly as advertised - it allowed me to record OTA television, use a 'guide' to select channels, set repeating programming, and much more.  I did notice that the video and audio was slightly less presentable when I viewed shows through the box versus directly on my UHDTV, but this was not an issue since I was pleased to simply be able to record OTA television.

I bought this product for its PVR/DVR functionality, my HD TV already has a built in antenna tuner. In order to use it to record TV you have to connect a USB drive. After reading that many USB Thumb drives were too slow, I decided to use an old 3.5 80GB hard drive I had laying around. Out of the box the time shift functionality worked great, no problems. I used it extensively during the Olympics to pause live TV and then skip commercials.  While time shift worked great, recording and playing back TV using the scheduling feature was a bit iffy. It would freeze randomly on playback. This was resolved when I contacted ViewTVs support and they quickly emailed me a software update in 2 business days. The 2016 firmware update worked great. The ViewTV AT-163 now works exactly, as I would have hoped especially given the price.

I choose this product over competing ones because it came with an HDMI cable, no complaints about the quality of that cable. I even get more stations than we did with the TVs built in antenna, 26 total!

OTHER NOTES:
Some other reviews have complained about the remote. The build quality is perfectly adequate, and well labeled. Ive used much worse remotes. The button labeling and placement makes sense for everything except when browsing recorded files. For example you have to press the EPG button and then OK to delete a file. At least there is an onscreen guide explaining what buttons do what so it is still usable.

The fact that the USB port is on the front of the device is a little annoying.

I paid $30 for the device and have used this product for over a month. Been a cable cutter for over 10 years.

USE TIPS:
You will want to go into the setting and set the PVR size to 4GB, its maximum. With that set I could pause live 1080i TV for about 50 minutes before it would reach its 4GB allocation and start cutting off the beginning of the recording.

If you have an extra coax cable and your TV has a turner built in, you can set the device to passthrough mode and you can watch something on your TV while you record another show to the PVR.",09-08-2016,09-08-2016

Now  everything is working. The menu system is a little slow to respond, I may not have the remote correctly pointed to the receiver. But it does work and for the price it is pretty good. One thing that was very useful is the info button, where it shows the signal strength on each channel- I used that alone to pin point & adjusted my antenna. The recordings & DVR work great.

You can record real time or use the Electronic Program Guide to do timed recordings. I first tried a 64GB thumb drive. The recording hiccuped quite a bit on playback. I switched to a 1TB external drive and recording and playback were perfect. The remote is a little finicky but works from across the room. 5 stars and money well spent.

It even picked up premium movie channels, but they were blacked out. Bummer. Anyway. it took all of five minutes, and I was up and running. High Def (1080i) channels look freakin' amazing! Crystal clear, with no display judder and no lag! Absolutely perfect picture, with just a cheap OTA antenna plugged into the rear input. The screen menu is very easy to use and very intuitive. I was very surprised that the remote even controls the volume on my Rotel 1056 AV Receiver. The front display is bright and easy to view. Wow!

This resolved the issue and my PC still was able to copy the .mts files from the drive. I use Handbrake to convert the .MTS files to .MP4 files so I can watch them on my iPad.  The other issue I had was that the daily timer was not working.  ViewTV support provided me with a new .bin file which resolved this issue.  ViewTV will respond to email queries, you just have to be a bit patient.  It sometimes takes a few days for them to respond.  Box works great now.",04-11-2016,04-11-2016

I forget the brand name of one of my old converters that I didn't need and gave away, however, this is even better than my Tivax brand STB-T9 that is still working after many years on another of my TV's.  And the picture from this is far better than the picture I got from a Mediasonic Homeworx HW220STB.  The picture from the Mediasonic just wasn't as clear or vivid, more soft than with my other adapters.  Maybe it was because my TV is from 1983.

The digital recorder, which the manufacturer refers to as ""PVR"", is what really is satisfying.  You can pull up upcoming shows by channel, select the show you want to record, and specify f you want to record it once, daily or weekly -- it is that easy.  If you want to see what you recorded, you can display the PVR list.  I have had the box running for days, and it is only slightly warm to the touch.  I'm recording onto USB 2 flash memory, which works well with high def.  A one hour high def show can take 4 GBs, where 1 hour at low def takes approximately 1 GB.  Another nice feature is that I can download my recordings to my computer (MAC) and review, rename or review each there, then copy these back out to flash card fir viewing on the Viewtv box. This is an excellent functioning and low cost ATSC Tuner, DVR and full function remote;  how do they do it for only $39.99?  I was so impressed with this unit that I purchased a second one.

Update:  What the instructions don't tell you:
1.  The box only has a USB 2.0.  It does not support USB 3.0
2. Press the ""info"" button once on your remote, and it displays the channel/station info, but you have to press The info button a second time to display the station strength meter.
3. Recorded output is in the form of a .mts file.  After approximately 4.29 GB of recording, the ViewTV cuts a new output file under the same name, but with an extension of .mts1, and then .mts2. If needed.
4. On the Mac, the QuickTime player will play a .mts file, albeit occasionally it will hang up.  Even though it may hang up on the Mac, it is still usable on the ViewTV.  My QuickTime player can't handle a .mts2 file, but again, for large, multi-file videos, I use the ViewTV.  Incidentally, you can rename your files on your computer and then download to your USB thumb drive.
5. Finally, I use high speed flash memory cards in a USB 2.0 flash reader.  If you use a USB 2.0 Thumb Drive, make sure it is at least 40 Mbps speed in order to record in high definition.  I have absolutely no issues at 40 Mbps.

11/03/17 update:  it is still worker great for recording OTA content.  Im using SanDisk USB 3.0, 32 and 64 MB thumb drives purchased inexpensively at Amazon. Note: plug the thumb drive into a Samsung TV USB port, and the recorded video contents can be displayed directly and easily on the TV, obviating the need for the ViewTV box for playback.",03-25-2016,03-25-2016

Extremely satisfied and highly recommend.  Picture quality off my antenna system is perfect.

It is great for the basement TV (which is a mammoth 36"" Sony CRT which is coming out of the basement in many pieces when it dies, and hopefully after I sell the house).

DTV tuning is excellent! USB playback is quite good, but sometimes it grabs secondary audio tracks instead of the primary, and sometimes those audio tracks will ONLY play through digital-out, not analog. There are a lot of menus to navigate with virtually no instructions to guide you through each one, but each is not overly-complicated. The instructions you do receive are printed tiny and somewhat haphazardly organized. Buttons on the remote perform strange functions, like ""press hold to view fullscreen"" - while the ""hold"" button seems to do nothing else. Why not label this button as ""Fullscreen"" (or FS to save real estate)? But, once you read carefully and practice-practice-practice, it does do a very good job.

There is an option for Software Upgrade in the menus, but I cannot find a current version or a list of firmware versions on their website --- or really ANY support section of their website... A downloadable PDF copy of the instructions (so you could search & zoom in!) and a software update would likely solve every single problem I am having, which are not dealbreakers by any means.

There are also some hidden games in the menus. They are quite awkward with the remote, but well played, ViewTV. Well played.",03-15-2016,03-15-2016

Also, the unit picks up over the air paid channels. While this may be a plus for some but not for me. I mention this as a negative point for the machine only because you can delete all free channels once and streamline your viewing pleasure. However, the paid channels will return to your menu every time you shut the unit down. This may be a minor inconvenience but an annoying inconvenience none the less.

Goodbye $110 a month. It felt great. Now, the performance. Once you get used to it, piece of cake. Keep in mind. Like other reviews, I did find the IR control a little weak.

If you want to record stuff, shove a usb memory stick in the slot and it should work. It won't include audio if you try to play programs recorded by the box on a computer for some strange reason. If you're handy with computers you may be able to fix this though.

The channel guide doesn't work one bit, so just pretend it's 1998 before that was a thing.

Instead of sequential numbers it will organize channels into confusing and seemingly arbitrary codes, regardless of original channel order. For example channel 29 became 28-2 and then 30 became 64-4.

All operations (although not intuitive) work smooth and so far have been trouble free.  A USB flash drive (tested several) is not large enough nor have sufficient data transfer speed ability for smooth operation.  A USB powered hard drive stresses the units power supply and many have experienced premature failure using these drives.  Also, the unit will not benefit from USB 3.0.  This is the single biggest issue with these type of PVR units.

My elderly mother is using this, so I composed basic user instructions that others could also benefit from.  Please like this to keep it at the top of the list for others to benefit from too.

Basic things to remember:

EXIT takes you backwards 1 step and will be used often.

The VOLUME controls on the remote are dependent on the volume set with the TV.  If the TV volume is set to 0, the PVR remote will not change the sound.  If the PVR remote is at full volume and the sound is too quiet, the TV remote must be used to increase the volume more.

All times are based on 24 hour clock, so 8:00pm is really 20:00

Aim remote at PVR box and press button firmly.  If the button did not seem to do anything, wait a few more seconds before pressing it again or the next button.  DO NOT press a button a bunch of times.

If the PVR freezes on a screen for a few minutes, try pressing the power button on the front.  If still nothing happens, switch the power off with the power strip, wait a minute then turn the power strip back on.  (Don't have the hard drive plugged into this power strip)

Any timed recording supersedes a program you are watching live or from the DVR.  The recording mode will begin whether the unit is on, in standby, watching a time shifted live program or watching a recorded event.

How to record a show in the future (like an old VCR)
1. Turn on TV and set input to PVR
2. Turn on PVR
3. Press TIMER button
4. Press 1 to add a new timed program
a. If you want to EDIT an existing program, use the direction keys to highlight the program and press 2.
b. If you want to DELETE an existing program, use the direction keys to highlight the program and press 3.
5. Using the arrow direction keys and select the item to edit it.
6. When changing the date or time, use the arrow keys to get to the number you want to change, then use the number keypad to enter the new number.  After pressing the first number, the underline automatically moves to the next one.
7. Once all data is entered and correct, press the OK button to confirm, then press EXIT to return back to the previous screen.  If you are not going to use the PVR to watch TV, press the POWER button to put the unit into standby.

How to record a show TONIGHT (program guide)
This is useful if you want to record something at 11pm but do not want to stay up for it.
It is also useful if 2 shows you want to watch are at the same time.  Record one with the PVR and watch the other with the TV set to TV input.
1. Turn on TV and set input to PVR
2. Turn on PVR
3. Press EPG (Electronic Program Guide) button

How to Pause live Television (skip commercials!)
This is useful if you want to fix a bite to eat, use the bathroom or so something else while and later return to the program and skip over the commercials.  Remember that you cant fast-forward past live TV.
1. Turn on TV and set input to PVR
2. Turn on PVR
3. Set the channel with the channel keys
4. At any given point you want to pause the program, press PAUSE key.  A slight delay will occur while this puts the PVR into time-shift mode and the picture pauses with the time bar shown below.  To remove the time bar from the screen, press INFO.
  a. While in time-shift mode, you can fast-forward FWD or rewind REV from the point you first paused the TV up to live TV.  Press PLAY to resume playing at the selection point.
  b. Each subsequent time you press fast-forward FWD or rewind REV the speed goes faster, from 2x to 4x to 8x etc as displayed on the top of the screen.  Press PLAY to resume playing at any point.
  c. If you change channel, the PVR will cancel the time-shifted recording in memory.
5. Press the STOP key to cancel the time-shift and stay on the channel.

How to watch a recorded program
The recorded files will have a name that shows the channel, date and time.  Since your show may not be obvious you can play it on this same screen including fast forwarding.
1. Turn on TV and set input to PVR
2. Turn on PVR
3. Press the PVR LIST button
4. Use the arrow keys to select the a program and press OK to start the playback
5. If this is not the correct show, use the arrow keys to select a different one and press OK
6. If the show on the mini screen is the one you want, press the HOLD key to display it as full screen.
7. Use the PAUSE, PLAY, fast-forward FWD or rewind REV to skip around commercials.
8. To delete a program, return to the PVR LIST view, select the program you want to delete and press EPG.  Confirm selection with OK, and then confirm the deletion by pressing OK again.",02-24-2016,02-24-2016

I could have use my HD TV, as it has a built-in tuner (most do), but I wanted to use the Personal Video Recorder (PVR) to occasionally record programs. As a tuner and PVR, this product works well. It produces a great picture and sound, and once you figure it out, it records to a USB flash drive perfectly. There are, however, a couple of ""Cons"": 1) It only displays a 24-hour clock (military time) and there's no way of changing it. Normally, this isn't a problem, but if you want to set up a PVR recording in advance, you'll need to translate normal (12-hour) time to 24-hour time. 2) The User Manual leaves a LOT to be desired. It is poorly written and doesn't cover all functionality. (I'm a technical writer, so I know what a good user manual should look like.) If you rely heavily on a manual, I would skip this product. If you're kind of ""geeky"" and are willing to try to figure things out on your own, this shouldn't be a problem.  3) The Antenna Power Switch, which can be used with an amplified antenna to boost the signal, doesn't work. Although I can turn it on in the Settings, it doesn't stay on. I contacted Support and had already tried their ""solution."" After some back-and-forth, they said they'd consider including the issue in the next firmware update.

UPDATE 3/2/2016: I've had this for a few weeks and have become disenchanted with it. So much so, that I completely disconnected it. There were a few local channels I watched regularly on cable that I could not receive via OTA using this product, even after moving my antenna every place possible. On a whim, I connected the antenna directly to my TV and they all came in perfectly.

I have a 64GB USB flash drive connected to it via the USB port which allows me to take my recordings on the road. I don't recommend using platter-based hard drives as they take time to spin up, so you can miss the beginning of programmed recordings - unless of course you set it to record 1 minute earlier.

The interface is a little clunky and it does not have the bells and whistles you're accustomed to seeing on TiVo and cable boxes, but you do get an Electronic Program Guide (EPG) - which you can use to look up daily programs for a channel. Select the program you want to record as well as the frequency (once, daily, or weekly) and you're done. None of the brands I mentioned have a standard remote interface, so I have to review the buttons for the other 2 boxes as I don't use them as often, but once you get used to the remote layout, it will become second nature to use.

I use an external UHF/VHF rooftop antenna and get 30+ channels in the NYC area - some of them are total rubbish, so I just delete them from my channel listing. The image quality is excellent, so I have no complaints there. The great thing about the portability of the recorded media is that you can export the files to your laptop/desktop and using a video editor, delete commercials and anything else you don't want, and build your own video library of your favorite shows.

The best thing about these digital tuner boxes is that you don't have to pay monthly fees - you buy the box and an antenna if you don't have one, and that's the end of the charges: no need to pay for monthly TiVo or cable service to view your local networks. The fact that the box can also be used to freely record local network TV shows is absolutely awesome! One less bill to worry about.",12-24-2015,12-24-2015

Bad Remote Design,"The general idea of this product is good - convert digital over-the-air TV signals to play on your old analog TV with the ability to add memory and record TV.  I bought it to be able to continue to use my old (but great) analog DVR, and it works for that.

Unfortunately, it's difficult to operate and the software for it sucks.  For example, when you set a recording to repeat ""daily"" the software sets the next recording in the series to record 6 days after the last recording, not 1 day as expected.  So, every day you have to correct the recording date for the upcoming recording or miss a recording.  It displays program descriptions of programs that are playing but the text of the descriptions is all broken up.  Also, if you press too many buttons while trying to figure out how to use it, it'll crash and you have to unplug it and plug it back in it to reboot it.  I have to do that almost every day.

The functions don't map well to the remote buttons.  For example, to delete a recording you hit ""EPG"", to go to full screen from the record screen, you hit the ""Hold"" button.  Huh?  It's like they bought a 3rd party remote and mapped the functions they needed as best they could to the buttons available on the remote.

The remote design is also bad.  The labels for the buttons at the top of the remote are above the buttons.  The labels for the buttons at the bottom of the remote are below the buttons.  It's confusing.  See picture.

One good thing I can say about this receiver is that I can use it to boost the signal to my TV.  The TV signal is more broken up when I don't route it through this product.  But that's not what the receiver is intended for.",12-09-2015,12-09-2015

The on screen displays are nice and large so they are readable. The aspect ratio seems to auto adjust which my TV didn't. The tuner is pretty sensitive and is gathering a few more channels that I didn't have on the built-in.  I tested pause/play DVR functionality and it works as expected.  I haven't been able to fully test all the timer recording yet though.

The one big drawback is the remote.  The layout is not intuitive and the buttons are all just small squares so it's easy to lose what you are looking for. I may try to address this with a nice universal remote but that adds to the cost.

It doesn't pick up the stations as well as my tv does even though I live on the second floor close to the top of a hill. For some reason while trying to record a weekly program it will record the program fine, but then apparently it thinks a week is 10 days and schedules the next program 10 days later. So every week I have to set each program back to the right date. And yes it only uses military time, but just remember that 6:00 PM is 18:00 hours and work from there.  Another issue, I record a 2 hour block on Fox one night and a 2 hour block on CBS another night. The 2 hour Fox program plays back fine, but the CBS block will freeze and crash the PVR. It eventually resets, but I can't watch the CBS block through the PVR. Fortunately I have a USB port on my TV that I can use to watch the program.

The power supply is built into the unit and fails, taking the unit down with it when it goes. When it works, it's good and does what it says, but when the power supply melts, there's no way to save the unit. At the low price, it's pretty easy to replace, but that's not the point. I'm currently trying the RCA unit from Wal Mart that has an external power supply. Software is nearly identical, but their remote layout is pretty bad. But if the RCA unit lasts longer than a year we're ahead. The original review is below, and I originally gave the ViewTV box 4 stars, but I won't be buying another one based on power supply melt-downs.

If you want something to record digital over-the-air TV programs, this is it. We bought it along with a 128GB USB flash drive and it holds more programs than we've ever had on there at one time. Playback quality is very good (as good as the original broadcasts) and the remote control buttons are well laid out and easy to use. It only gets 4 stars, however, because if you bump the USB flash drive even the least little bit or if the Converter Box loses power, you have to re-format the flash drive and you lose all the programs saved up to that point. How sensitive? We dust AROUND the unit so we don't even brush against the flash drive with a dusting cloth.

Having said that, I'm glad we bought it. We don't have TIVO and once purchased, this is free and without any kind of monthly subscription fee. That didn't make sense seeing as how we dumped cable to get rid of those bills. I'd recommend this easily - just be careful with the dusting cloth.  : )",11-22-2015,11-22-2015

update 5/12/16:  I had noticed that fast forwarding was failing, and while that alone was aggravating, if it happened in the 45th minute of a 60 minute program, you were forced to start the fast forward search again from the beginning, and the image on the screen made this oh-so-tedious and time consuming.

With a good antennae, this converter adds the correct amount of something extra I had not anticipated. The box shows the signal strength it's receiving. In my living room, box #1 gets all the HD channels available over the air. From 2.1 to 65.4. That's all the channels you can imagine. Cooking shows, kids, movies (old and newer), craft, international... and more. The best part... it's FREE! ViewTV has that something extra I didn't read in the description and still don't know if it's there. It's a DVR man! Pop in a 32GB or better a 64GB flash drive and you can pause live TV. Record shows, and a full guide. This stuff is subject to your area and whether or not the channel broadcasts it's guide, but for free it's pretty sweet. I now have channels in HD that my cable provider only broadcasted in SD. I could get things in HD if I paid for it, but of course they don't tell you (this is some channels mind-you), are already free over the air in HD. This sounds like an ad, but it's not, I'm a real 49 year old dude in PA, USA, who has successfully cut the cord. To get some of the premium stuff, look in to *SlingTV, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Fire. With these additions you'll have more than what you need. One small catch... you must have a good unlimited internet connection for the premium stuff. But not for VIEWTV!

Changed to two stars

Original review:

Not bad for the price, but get ready to struggle  lot to figure out how to operate it without accurate instructions. It does receive and use the QAM in-the-clear (broadcast networks) stations on the Verizon Fios network in  the Tampa area. You can delete the unwanted channels (scrambled) after auto-learning them all but it is tedious. It took me about 30 minutes of clicking to get all the ones off I didn't want (scrambled or blank). The manual says to use the ""04"" sequence to specify deletion, but just the ""4"" key worked for me, so many fewer keystrokes were required.

Problems:
 Wont stop recording if the recording period spans midnight. This happens with the Tonight shows, of course (23:37 to 00:35). The result is that the next day, it is still recording and the file is huge in size. The box asks you if you want to exit recording...If you left it for longer it would fill up your drive easily.

No guide for the QAM channels on Fios.

You can rename the channels to something sensible like ""CBS"" but I find that the box sometimes renames it back to the original gibberish numbers the next time it's started. This only happens for some channels, don't know why.",10-07-2015,10-07-2015

Requires constant attention. Try it - Amazon has a great (free) return policy.,"I returned the device, as it failed miserably as a set and forget PVR.
There are some good reviews for this product. It could be that I received an outdated unit. Otherwise people are either not using it as a PVR should be used, or the good reviews where paid for by the seller.
A much better device is the Mediasonic HW180STB HomeWorx HDTV Digital Converter Box with Media Player and Recording PVR Function, Dolby Digital, HDMI Out. This device had many of the same issues before it was updated. Now works great as a set and forget PVR.

These are the reasons why I gave this product a one star rating. All these issues occurred within the first week of use. The main issue is that it is advertised as a PVR (Programmable Video Recorder) device, but that function is mostly useless and there is no support to resolve issues. If someone had listed these issues as shown here, I would likely have looked to buy another product. Some issues are very blatant while others arise due to temporary interference on channels. Unfortunately, there will always be temporary interference and PVR devices should handle that possibility.

Annoying problems:
1. Resets to factory defaults unexpectedly (about twice a week)
2. Fails to find recorded programs (about three times a week - Reboot fixes problem)
3. Fails to decode some EPG information that other devices decode w/o a problem
4. Cannot watch a recorded program while it is recording another.
5. It does not allow for programming just week days (skipping weekends), it can only do: ""Once"", ""Daily"", or ""Weekly"", AND WEEKLY DOES NOT RECORD EVERY 7 DAYS (SEE BELOW)
6. Sometimes the recordings abort prematurely (When channel signal has temporary interference)
7. Does not allow hiding unwanted channels
8. Creates cryptic file names instead of trying to use the names of the recorded program
9. Often locks up inexplicably then self reboots after 10 minutes
10. The digital display is pretty much useless, as it does not indicate when the PVR is recording a program nor does it show the actual channel the PVR is recording (ex. Channel 21.1 shows C001, which is useless)
11. It waits a minute before the recorder starts recording a scheduled program, thus the start of the recorded program is lost. Most programs today start right on time
12. It only allows 30 scheduled recordings to be ""booked"". When it does not allow repeat recording for certain days, 30 becomes inadequate
13. Uses only military time
14. Can only delete one recording at a time, after watching several hours of shows, you have to delete each watched show individually. Then after deleting, it always jumps back to the first page where you have to page down again to continue deleting
15. Mostly senseless remote button layout and senseless button functions when navigating menus (ex. Press <EPG> to highlight program to be deleted, then unspecified <OK> to delete and <OK> again to confirm
16. Sometimes get disk error when trying to delete recorded programs (Reboot resolves the issue)
17. It stops recording without notice if the device is powered off
18. Sometimes refuses record when record button is pressed (Reboot resolves the issue)

Showstopper problems:
1. Often fails to recognize the hard drive (about every other day - Reboot fixes problem)
2. Often skips recording scheduled shows (No disk Detected or when sitting on a bad signal where it fails to switch to the scheduled channel)
3. Does not list every HD channel when trying to ""Add"" (schedule) a program manually. Thus some channels w/o EPG info can never be scheduled for recording
4. When scheduling a program to record ""Weekly"", the device schedules the next event 12 or 13 days in advance. Clearly, this is a major showstopper, as it should count by seven days for weekly programs
5. No technical support - You can email them, leave them a voice message, but do not expect a response, as they apparently have no answers for the many problems

All in all, It works fine as a digital converter and on-the-fly recording, but fails miserably as a ""set and forget"" PVR.",08-01-2015,08-01-2015

If you are looking for a simple HD ATSC / Digital converter box for an old TV or computer monitor, this is fine.
If you want the DVR functions, think again.

I have owned a magnavox mdr557h (DVD/HDD recorder with tuner), a Tivo, and this.

The Tivo was the best until the tv tuner sort of died, and so did the ""unlimited suscription"" I had.  Out of warranty, out of luck.  The magnavox works more like old VHS VCR - you program by date, time and channel number, no guide, you provide the label for each recording (or set of recordings), the only difference is that it records to a hard disk (or DVDs) instead of a bunch of VHS tapes.  Also, it is SD only, downconverts HD signals to SD, which surprisingly is still very good quality.

Now on to the product - the ViewTV sounds good, if it actually did everything well.  However, for everything it does, there is a glitch:
1. Scheduled recordings - time: this thing relies on the tv-station's clock.  Unfortunately TV stations don't care much about the ""time signal""  they send, so the time in this device keeps jumping.  It would be nice if it had its own internal clock (my cheap $20 casio keeps more accurate time than this).

2. Scheduled recordings - day: for some reason, if you select to record a program on a weekly basis, it makes it every 5 days or so (not 7 days!)  The calendar system on this is all screwed.  Again, if it had its own independent internal clock/calendar, this wouldn't matter.

3. Scheduled recordings - playback: Sure you can advance commercials, but frequently it gets stuck while doing it.  And it is not just a matter of hitting a button to ""unfreeze"".  You need to go to the device and unplug it, which in turn erases all your timer programming (scheduled tasks).

4. If you are recording, you can't do anything else with it.  Not even check/set your schedules or browse the guide.

5. You can only browse the guide for one channel at a time.  For example, you can see what's showing on ABC today, but you can't see what shows are airing at 8pm (not even for your favorites).

6. Incorrect date when selecting a program for recording.  If you choose to record a program from the guide, it will apparently set it right, but then when you check the recording schedule, it is all wrong.

7. Can't set a label for timer programming, nor does it set it from the guide.  For example, if you want to record Castle every Monday, the recordings show up as WPLG-201507202200 (tv station, plus date and time in military format).  If you record 10 shows a week, that's 10 lines of programming that you need to decipher if you want to find a particular show.

8. The user interface and remote are a joke.  Hard to find buttons, inconsistent labels, mispellings, conflicts with other devices (press ""2"" and my hdmi switcher changes device).

9. Support is non-existent.  For sales they sure answered one question I posted, but after that, nothing.

I give it two stars because as a Digital TV converter box works well and when it worked, it did record in HD, neat.  As a DVR it has potential.  But like similar boxes that seem to be clones (iview, mediasonic homeworkx, ematic) they all have the same glitches.  Once all the glitches are removed (if ever), this would easily be a five start product that would send ChannelMaster's DVR+ off the market.

I returned mine since DVR was the main purpose of my purchase.",07-20-2015,07-20-2015

In general the ViewTV AT-163 works but I do get frustrated by those mysterious hangs where I have not choice but to power off/on the ViewTV box and start over what I was doing before the hang.
The remote works but sluggishly, you need to slow down and be very deliberate on your button depressions. Pausing will become a way of life.
Flipping to full screen from preview mode sometimes causes hangs and needs a power clear to fix.
Quality of the recordings are fine, but really depends on how good your antenna is and if it's pointed at the broadcasting tower correctly.  IMHO, I would switch to a Omni Directional TV antenna to pick up the signals from 3 broadcast towers that are at compass direction of 95,127 and 156 degrees.  The ViewTV signal receivers can not show a descent picture on your TV unless your TV antenna performs as well.  Lousy antenna means lousy quality on the ViewTV box.
I move my external HD back to my computer to copy the recorded shows (MTS file format. Delete what I don;t need while on my computer and re-attach my external hard drive with a re-discover process on the ViewTV box to be sure it learns of the hard drive and detected the amount of available drive space.
The EPG button gives you the upcoming shows and times but it seems to not show more than a half days worth.  I found that if you use the record weekly you in effect get to record a series if it's at the same time and channel each week.
This reminds me of my old tape VCR days but the ViewTV AT-163 is a better box.  I plan to keep this box and not return it, it's good enough to use as a back up  BASIC PVR with no frills.  I'll keep looking for another PVR that can record 4 shows at the same time.",07-07-2015,07-07-2015

I gave it three stars because of all the functions the unit has.  With all the operations this unit can do, one would think it would sell for a higher price.  Having the program guide is a big plus.  Being able to rename recordings is great.  A con on renaming is you can not rename the OTA channels it picks up.  Does very well in a scan to find what is in your area.  Another odd problem I discovered was with a 3-1/2"" hard drive.  When recording a program, the drive made a loud clicking and the drive was very hot.  I switched over to a usb powered drive and this problem did not show.  I don't know if it had anything to do with the different drives, but I did not like the noise or the heat.  The most annoying issue is with play back of a recorded program.  If you fast forward past the commercials there are times when the unit will lock up and the only way to fix the problem it to pull the plug.  If you are going to stop playback when in the middle or so of a two hour recording, best to check the time mark.  Several times restarting the playback at a different time, it may jump to that mark or it may just start over  Then you have the problem of fast forwarding to where you left off.
The unit does the job for OTA viewing and recording to some extent.  The problems it has can get to be a drag.

It would lockup so badly that the unit had to be unplugged to reboot and work again. Also many of the recordings did not complete or would not play past half of the recording. Bad batch of recorder decoder chips, its possible, or a program glitch. I have another brand that the software looks like it was written by the same company or individual and it works fine. Returned it and ordered another one. If this one does not work when I get it, that will pretty much say these are not so good. The unit is great had it worked and I love the remote as it is far better than the remotes to most of these units. My other units remote is horrible to use. UPDATE 7-6-2015 received a replacement item. IT WILL NOT WORK EITHER apparently what I suspected is true. All these units were produced with defective parts or programming. 2 OUT OF 2 DEFECTIVE I will not purchase another one of these that is for sure.",06-25-2015,06-25-2015

The power cord is permanently attached to the unit on the back and is not removable. It is located in my TV stand and all wires and power outlet are behind the TV and not easily accessible. I usually just unplug the cable from device itself in order to power cycle it, however with this device I can't do that. I have to move the TV and squeeze behind it to reach the power outlet to unplug the power cable.

The menu system is a little clunky but certainly navigable.  The system instructions say you can connect an external HD via USB (front panel).  I connected a spare 1TB drive, thinking ""that'll do it.""  The external drive was in NTSB format and the unit stores media in FAT32 format.  FAT32 is limited to 32GB partitions.  That being said, a flash drive of 32GB or less will be sufficient as long as the write time will keep up.  I placed an old spare 4GB flash drive on it and it worked perfectly.  It records 40 minutes of HD so, from that, you can figure about 10 minutes of HD per gig.  Therefore a 32GB flash should hold about 320 minutes.  Not bad for a (no monthly fee) OTA PVR.

For the money this is a very good piece of equipment.  I recently ""cut the cable"" and moved my TV source to Over The Air (OTA) TV and internet services (Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, Sling, etc).  It has been an excellent choice so far, but I have missed my DVR for shows I want to see later.  So while researching antenna sourced DVRs/PVRs, my choices were $200 and up-  then I found the Viewtv AT 163.  While it is primarily sold as a digital converter box, it also has PVR capabilities through your own USB portable HDD.
  Out of the box, it was small and light (remote is so light weight that it feels toy-ish).  I did not need this as a converter, but I tested it and it works really well, with the exception that it cannot seem to find one of my local stations, but all the other digital/HD channels look really good.  It pulled in 27 channels, where as my digital TV found 28 using the same masted antenna.
Pro's:
  Quickly set up, searched and found local channels
  Has ability to exclude channels via manual set up
  Has ability to set ""Favorites"" for quick channel jumping
  1 button channel menu with limited current show info
  Another button with detailed show info and current/future schedule
  You can set recording for a future show (but not far future)
  Surprisingly good clarity and no obvious signal loss in channel reception
  Playback of recordings are just as clear as the original (just like your cable DVR)
  Has ability to pause live TV (via time shifting)
  Records to your personal Hard Drive.  This is a Pro because it lowered the initial price and gives the ability to change HDDs when needed and you can remove the HDD and take it with you traveling to watch on your laptop, etc.  I bought a 1GB Toshiba portable HDD for about $50 and I can use it on any of my systems.
  Connections out include HDMI (I get 720i HD picture on most of my stations), AV (L/R Audio + Video RCA pins), and RF Coax out.  Also there is a USB connection to connect a HDD or USB thumb drive.

CON's:
  Layout of buttons on remote not intuitive, will take time to get proficient.
  Guide/Schedule is a bit rough, but it is dependent on info encoded in the broadcast TV signal so it's more of an adjustment from cable than a negative on this equipment
  Recording, pausing and other similar functions sometimes take a second or two to kick in.  Response to using the remote control buttons are just generally slow.
  Records one show at a time (again, not fair to compare this to $300 multi-tuner DVRs)
 I deducted a star because of the remote feel and the slow response to button pushing on the remote.

OVERALL:
  I am impressed.  I expected this would be - at worst -a digital converter box for an old TV in the shop---and at best a cheap gadget way to record off the air- and one step away from my old VCR stored in the closet.  Instead it is a very workable recording option for shows or sporting events.  I have a new toy that turns out to be everyday useful and I can record my football without falling behind in my Saturday yard work.
  For $35, it is an excellent buy.  Yes, it does not compare with $300 DVRs or your cable/satellite company's set top boxes, but for OTA, it is an excellent value and a solid low cost/low frills option to the higher cost/higher frills Tablo or ChannelMaster DVRs.",06-13-2015,06-13-2015

I have  tried the iView 3500, the Homeworx 180.  The Homeworx died after 6 months of light use.  So I was looking for something to replace it.  The other boxes only picked up 24 of the 39 channels available, this one only picked up 18.  So I thought I'd use it on my QAM Cable channels, but it is not good at that either.  This is the only QAM tuner in my house, that doesn't filter out the scrambled channels.  So it finds all 500 instead of the 80 unscrambled channels.  In order to use this, you need to know the subchannels, the iview and my TVs all use the same scheme as my cable provider, but not this box, you need to know what channel is the clear qam equivalent of 13.  So you need to type 60-13 to get to 13.  Not a huge problem, if there were a way to use channel up and down to find them.  But you have to wade through 400 scrambled channels to find them!  The iView used the correct qam numbers, picked up more channels, priced lower.

I ordered a different converter first for the same price, and it didn't work at all.  I tried all of my antennas and TVs with it.  A light on the front just blinked and blinked and the box didn't connect to anything successfully.  I had to return it.  This converter worked immediately when I hooked it up.  It is currently connecting a digital antenna to a very old television.  The picture is even better than when I had cable.  This digital converter also has a program guide that shows you what is on each channel and what is coming up, which is amazing to me!  It makes me want to get one for all of my TVs with digital antennas now.  It also has a recording feature.  All you have to do is click on a program in the guide to schedule a recording.  It's a small box.  You can tell the box and the remote are well-constructed.  The output options provide ways to connect to even the most up-to-date devices with HDMI, and it comes with an HDMI cable.  The first one I purchased did not.

Good remote, easy setup, menu was good.  The USB port is in the front - I don't know why - and the display is arbitrary - channel 001 is the first channel it finds, not the actual channel you are on.

Tuning was great - it picked up multiple channels and the picture was great.  The EPG was decent, but scheduling took a bit of planning - it did not like a recording starting before midnight and ending after.  The big issue is that it consistently missed scheduled recordings.  The USB storage devices (I tried 3 different types) would randomly not show up while attached.  I set the unit to record NCIS every Tuesday for 3 weeks, as well as some random shows at 2am and 7am.  It recorded randomly - I got 1 episode of NCIS and 2 or 3 shows during the AM time frame.

I tried 3 USB sticks - ranging from 2GB to 16GB, a brand new 1TB WD USB drive (powered by USB), and an external 320GB USB drive that had it's own power supply.  After contacting Viewtv via email - I received no response and returned the unit.  Maybe cable/satellite have us by the necks for DVR - as tivo is $15/month for service and the channel master is $300.",04-11-2015,04-11-2015

I had to come back and warn everyone. DO NOT BUY this product. I've nothing but problems with this box. Now it refuses to power up if anything is plugged into the usb port. If you can't plug a flash drive you can't record. Worthless piece of junk.

I wish I could rate this box higher. But, it has a serious flaw. The tuner is sub-par. If you live close to TV stations you're trying to pick up, then this box should work fine. But, if you live some distance from the transmitters or live in a multi-city market (like I do) you may have some reception problems with this box. It only picks up and holds the strongest of signals. It has trouble holding any signal that falls below around 55%.

But, that aside the box works pretty well. I only bought a 3.0, 32g flash drive to use with this unit.

Some small things you'll need to know. The unit seems have some trouble figuring out daylight savings time. But,if you're using the EPG to set your recordings, you'll be setting it by program title and it won't matter. When setting a recording, be sure and scroll down and highlight ""record"" on the onscreen menu, then press ""ok"". If you don't do this the box may not record your show.

Also, when you call up the recorded programs list: after you highlight the show you want to watch, don't press ""ok"", instead press ""play"". Pressing ""ok"" makes the program play in a preview box. You're supposed to able to press ""hold"" to make it fullscreen, but this doesn't work all the time. Sometime the box will just freeze it you do that. And you'll have to unplug it reset it.

Overall, it works pretty well. Considering it records in HD and it's so cheap, making it worth buying. Just be aware it's not perfect.

Small update: DO NOT turn ""Daylight Saving Time"" on. This box is totally confused by daylight saving time. If you enable it the box will record one hour late every time.",04-08-2015,04-08-2015

Worst is that Mute puts up a permanent, stationary, full intensity indicator on the screen that will cause burn-in effects.  The mute issue alone makes this converter box unacceptable.  Other than that, it takes 15 seconds to boot, the channel display is both annoying and useless, the remote control is laggy, and it forgets settings when powered off.

The burn-in issue can be worked around somewhat by using the auto-shutoff feature to make sure the display doesn't stay on for many hours with the Mute indicator on.",04-07-2015,04-07-2015

I have a 15-year-old CRT television that was most definitely NOT digital ready.  I have Hulu and Prime instant video through my Wii console, but I wanted to be able to watch current news and local weather without being online.  So I ordered this converter.

This was a breeze to set up.  The instruction manual could be a little better edited (instructions for HDMI and other types of connections get mixed in together) but I was able to figure it out anyway.  I obviously can't use an HDMI connection with my old TV, but there is an included red-yellow-white composite cable and that worked with my TV (my TV is not capable of stereo sound so I just don't plug in the red plug and it still works).  There is also a ""signal out"" connector that looks like a coaxial cable would connect to it, so you can probably use that as an output option to your TV if you'd like.  (You'd need to supply the coaxial cable.)

When I first plugged this in, I got a screen prompting me to choose a language.  English was the default, so I pushed the ""OK"" button on the remote and this converter immediately went into scan mode and started picking up TV channels.  After that, I could just watch.  It set channel numbers up so they're all right in a row, so I don't have to skip through lots of channel numbers of static like in the analog days.  (On the other hand, you can forget about local channel numbers as the numbers on the front of the box don't match up to anything identifiable.)  Scanning was a little slow, but there was a progress bar on the screen.

You will need the following items to make this work:

(1) An antenna.  Amazon has plenty of these for sale.  I have one of the indoor HDTV ones and it pairs perfectly with this converter box.
(2) Two AAA batteries for the remote (it does not come with batteries).

At any rate, I've had the TV on for several hours in the background and I am getting the expected picture and sound quality for my television.

This unit apparently records video if you have a USB memory stick.  I have no interest in this function so I have not tested it (I generally only watch series television on DVD and, at any rate, I can catch older things with Hulu or Prime in most instances), but it is available.

The box is pretty small, about 8.5 by 5.5 by 1.5 inches.  It gets a little warm while running but not any more than you would expect from a cable box or something similar.

Another sample of this same product would occasionally lock up when in a menu and required power down/power up to reset.

The channel setup menu doesn't include channel editing, which is found in the separate Program menu.  That caused me some frustration.

Many functions can be done without the remote, through the buttons on the front panel, but I couldn't figure out how to make timed recordings with just them.

The warranty is terrible, only 90 days and requires enclosing a check or money order for $17.  I think someone at ViewTV said the $17 was to discourage returns, but I couldn't understand their pronunciation.",02-08-2015,02-08-2015

I got this at good price with promotion code making it excellent value.

Tuning is good, shows signal strength and also pulls EPG information very well. I was able to add an harddrive for recording and it works well with portable HDD.

Positives list:
1. Very sensitive tuner :
 Compared to all other tuners I have, LG TV Tuner, Boxee TV tuner, Silicon Dust HD Homerun(2 units), Pinnacle TV Tuner, Hauppuage WinTV PVR, this is most sensitive and able to tune most channels, some I did not even know that exist. I bought this for Theater room Projector to watch live TV while other.
2. Very small unit: Fits in very small places, behind TV etc.
3. Has pass thru output for RF. Means you can tune both this unit and TV connected to RF pass thru(There are few options there).
4. Able to pull full available EPG information available for each channel. Simple info can show current program info, and upcoming program info also.
5. Shows signal strength and signal quality info which lets you position antenna for your fav channels. My LG tv is does this, but it is buried so deep, and I need to go into manual tuning mode and select channel and wait for few seconds to show that info.  This unit it is much easier.

6. There is no monthly fee to see the guides like some units. For me TV Guide app in iPad shows all info I need. But this show todays EPG for given channel.

Coming to issues:

1. EPG information is shows for current channel that is tuned. That means if you are in channel 13, you can only see EPG information for channel 13.
2. Live TV pause is bit crude, it is lagging behind quite few seconds. When I click pause it takes a while to get into Live Record/Pause Mode and lags behind few second. This is not a problem with my LG TV(Yes my LG TV has built in PVR function with a small hack). Not a problem with Media Center from HD Homeruns.

3. Remote is so, so, (not too bad). But not a problem as I use my Logitech Harmony.
4. Upscaling is below average. It has problems esp with Reds. Some of the SD channels (sub channels of main channels) are transmitted in 480i, and this upscales to 1080i and reds look pretty bad with some tearing. But If this annoying I simply change output to 480i on those channel and let TV upscale that.

You might be wondering with all these negatives how it got 4 stars. The main purpose of this unit for me is Live TV feed for my projector. That it serves well, but because of other pit falls, I gave 4 stars.",02-03-2015,02-03-2015

I used the PWOW 1080P Mini HDMI Male To VGA RGB Converter Video Adapter With Audio and it works great.
  Also this works excellently as digital media player and is capable of playing just about any video file I have thrown at it, including flv's.
  With that said this is not the most user friendly device but well worth the $48 it cost, and it is easy to learn after a bit of playing around with it.
  It does detect ALL cable channels encrypted and unencrypted but does not differentiate between them so you will have to delete which channels you cannot watch.
  You also might want to keep this device always on as it is somewhat although not to difficult to recover your setting once it restarts.  It does not delete your settings though, it just kinda hides them from you and is pretty hard to explain but easy to figure out.
  The games are kinda weird but cool, occasionally I will play the old-school tetris and such.
  This device can also be tweaked by electronics techies for purposes I will not mention here.

Normally I would drop down a star because of the nonexistent web support but this device way exceeded my expectations, it is very solidly old school constructed and I am very very happy with it and plan on buying another.

Use computer to do multiple changes to a recorded program; including deletion. REMEMBER you can only do one things at a time.
TIME: you can not set the time...therefore you can't control the timer. It takes 10-40 seconds for you recording to START and sometimes, out-of-the-blue it'll run 5-mins ahead of the current time.

Great High Def Picture Via HDMI To Your HDTV.,"First I want to say that the first box I received did not work correctly immediately. The box kept failing to maintain recognition that my external drives were in fact present, no matter how many different types I used. There was surely something wrong with the ViewTV. (The ViewTV I received had software version installed from last month.)

I called the ViewTV company and they were really great. The nice tech support guy agreed I had to have something wrong with the unit...and he rushed me out a replacement. The replacement works much better...and interestingly its software version is dated 7 months ago.

I think the ViewTV at $50 is really a great value. (And I was impressed with the customer service the company provided.)

Running the antenna channel scan is relatively fast. The picture quality on my replacement box is stellar. Moving through all the settings menus is very easy and straightforward. Everything is easy to figure out.

When you think about the box's limitations, as pointed out by some very helpful reviews here, you must keep in mind the very reasonable price.

For $50 you get a good over the air box with a good tuner that sends a great picture via HDMI to your TV. You can time shift your viewing, if you plug in a drive to the USB port, and you can record programs to said drive.

For $50 you cannot expect multiple tuners or a great TV Guide. But at least you get to see the very basic guide info the broadcasters send down with their OTA signal. (My two HDTV's on their own do not show the OTA program info, which is very disappointing.)

For cable cutters out there on a budget, this box is definitely something you should consider. It delivers really well exactly what it promises.",10-31-2014,10-31-2014

This little box works great! My only purpose for obtaining cable was to watch live sports. Everything else is streamed. So if you are using this and only watching TV it may not be exactly what you need. Might be better to upgrade your cable subscription. The two things that you should know  is. 1. It changes around all you channels from the cable provider as it searches for available channels, I made a cheat sheet so I would know to go to 32-3 or whatever for my favorite channels. 2. The box searches for channels and some of the normal channels you may have cannot be found and converted. To get around this I use my TV provider to stream channels like ESPN, TNT, Fox Sports 1 from my X-Box. TWC has a live TV app for TNT, Fox Sports 1 and several others. ESPN has their app for streaming. Overall it did the trick to get my HD Sports on the major broadcasting channels.",10-29-2014,10-29-2014

Died after 6 months. Bought another.","UPDATE: The unit just died. I used it for about 6 months. All of a sudden, the power won't even turn on. But it's only $35, so I just bought another one. I almost got the $300 upgrade, but that one doesn't have an antenna pass-through. It's nice to be able to use the tuner on this and on my TV so I can record one thing and watch another.

PREVIOUS REVIEW: This device is working great. Been watching all my TV through this. The tuner is better than on my TV, so I get channels I didn't get before.  I can set it to record shows while I'm away, and while I'm watching live TV, I can pause it, which I love because I never have to watch commercials again. I just pause it for a while, go off and do something else, then come back and fast forward through the annoying commercials.

However, this is a basic, bare bones, and pretty ""cheap"" piece of equipment. First of all, you have to get some sort of storage, which adds to the cost considerably. I got a 1TB hard drive because I got tired of running out of space just using a flash drive. Now I'm able to record a whole weekend of football, but it cost like twice as much as I had planned to spend.

The other thing is that it it feels cheap. The buttons on the remote are really strangely labeled and don't correspond with the commands you want to use. So, in order to go from the menu window, where you select the show you want to playback, to full-screen playback mode (watching the show), you have to hit a button called ""hold"". To delete a show, you press button ""EPG"" (???) Couldn't they have just put different labels on the remote buttons? It's weird. But the directions are clear on the screen which button to press, so it's not a problem.

Finally, the USB port was just sort of hot-glued to the circuit board, so when I tried plugging in my hard drive, the socket pushed back inside the unit. I had to open the case and find it to plug my drive in. Kind of janky. But still highly functional!",10-17-2014,10-17-2014

What is pictured looks like a white text display, ""modern"" looking button symbols and general attractiveness. What I keep receiving is the 2nd picture which is an orange text and a display that is not as attractive looking. I was more upset because the first picture looked great and I was let down when I opened the box. Working with seller, Amazon and contact on View TV site now to resolve.

That aside, I really don't understand some of the negative reviews. I think the user interface is quite simple to use. I did not look at the manual at all, so I consider it somewhat intuitive. Want to record a show? Press the EPG button for the guide, select the show and record. Really that simple. Want to make it ""complicated"" go to the menu, then USB, then setup recording through there (still simple). Before that all I had to do was setup what I was going to record to and run the auto-tuning. I installed a jump drive, formatted it via the View TV interface and set that as the recording media.

I did the TV scan, it picked up all the channels my TV could and reception was great. I see reviews on here talking about issues with the reception, but there are so many variables that go into this that I have learned in the process of ""cutting the cord"" with cable. Granted, there could be issues with the box causing this, but there is a good chance there are issues with how people connect these (types of cables, splitters, routing, etc.). These issues can come with any device. I went from 22 channels to 30 channels on this same TV setup the day I installed the View TV only by changing my TV cable to a quad shield RG6 with some good compression ends, then I put a new compression end on the cable in the wall and removed my 90 deg turn. My front room had less than 16 channels and I changed from RG59 cable to the same quad shield RG6 to get up to 30. If people are using incorrect cables and splitters in an area that picks up a lot of noise, this can cause a lot of problems.

If you want to view the program you recorded, press the USB button, find the show and start playing. Again, very simple. For those looking to purchase a low cost option, I think this is a great piece for $50. Now I can record OTA programs with this at weird hours and still have shows to watch when I am wanting to.

My first interaction with recording was looking through the guide, finding some shows I liked that came on 3 hours later and then setting it to record (2) 30 minute segments. I turned everything off and left, when I came home the flash drive was flashing and it was recording. I checked the files on my PC as well as through the View TV and they played great (haven't watch start to finish yet only a few minutes). You will have to manually change DST if using the automatic clock so the times are right.

Edit: I was able to find the pass through option for cable in the settings after opening the manual (shame on me should have looked there first). I just was not clear on the terminology.

Overall this does exactly what I need it to, minus needing to split the signal coming in. Luckily I did not lose too much signal. I am impressed with the interface and features of this for the price. I would (have have) definitely recommend this if you are not as picky as I am about getting the ""cool"" looking one.",10-13-2014,10-13-2014

I knew the box would be small and not rack mountable but upon arrival, I was shock at how small the actual device was.  I was leery of the quality but proceeded to hook it up to my receiver and scan channels.  Any suspicions I had quickly melted away.  The tuner was more sensitive than the old T165.  Channels that came in on my other sets are now available in my HT.  The OTA viewer guide is very useful, giving you similar experience of Dish with upcoming shows and descriptions.  What I like the most is how easy it was to add time-shift and program recording.  All you need is a usb hard drive and you are all set.  Pausing live tv is a snap though initially a bit slow as there is a need to spin up the HD, but once paused, you can play and pause the live event without noticeable delay.  There seems to only be one digital tuner in the box thus you will not be able to watch one show while recording another.

They have a modern unit DCT310.800 that is on pare with this unit. My old unit can add more channels manually to add to your channel line up. This AT-163 can not. I live in a very rural area so i a have a antenna motor to turn my antenna to other areas of the State then add more stations to my list without losing my already stored station list. The digital out on the AT-163 will not give me true Dolby digital 5.1 like my old one will! In closing stay away!!!,06-18-2014,06-18-2014

I am now watching HDTV OTA via a Mohu 50 powered antenna and streaming thorough a popular streaming device. After I cut the cable, I have to admit I did miss the DVR my cable company provided so i did some research on an alternative. My must haves was that I wanted the DVR to do most everything my cable company DVR did but without paying a monthly charge. The Viewtv does mostly that. I had to buy a separate external HD USB device to complete this package. Set up was relatively simple however you do have to manually do everything to schedule a recording, meaning you have to tell the machine similar to an old VCR what day and times when you want it to record. Once you connect the Viewtv to your TV, you will use the Viewtv remote to change channels. Channel changing is crisp, however the same cannot be said about entering any menu guides within the Viewtv. There is a lag when you press the button to record or schedule a recording that can be annoying. I used to have Verizon Fios DVR which was similar to Tivo's DVR.

If you don't mind working a little to schedule your recordings and don't want to pay a monthly subscription, and want to spend around a hundred bucks, all in... then this DVR is for you. As with everything there are pros and cons.

Pros:
-This product is one of the cheapest I have been able to find and has worked reliably for the time I have been using it. (Since 6/9/14)
-The Viewtv converts (using HDMI) and displays my OTA powered antenna assisted HDTV signal beautifully. OTA TV Image quality is equal to my old Verizon Fios cable HDTV image quality. (no exaggeration.)
-The actual Viewtv box is very small, about the size of an average hardcover book.
-I can record on the fly if I need to take a phone call and record future shows with a little effort.
-Although the remote button layout is a little clunky, once you memorize what buttons does what, you should be ok.

Cons:
-Annoying lag time when you want to view shows you've recorded or want to schedule a recording. The Viewtv needs greater processing power to fix this issue.
-Viewtv comes with only one tuner so you cannot channel surf and record a program at the same time. (at least I haven't figured out how to do this yet.) For me this is huge. I will probably eventually upgrade to a more expensive DVR in the future to a device that can record multiple programs at the same time. If this is an issue for you, this Viewtv isn't for you.
-(For those new cable cutters:) In general, TV broadcasters are only required to display future programing 12 hours in advance in most cases. You have to go online to get the TV schedule for the week and know what day and time to record. Viewtv will display the schedule 12 hrs in advance only. This isn't Viewtv's fault, I just thought people should know.
-This box is not TiVo!!! I am spoiled when it comes to recording programs, I liked being able to ask my DVR to find a show by name and easily schedule a recording. Viewtv does not do that. Viewtv DVR is more akin to an old VCR, (for those old enough to remember those). I must admit I do miss that feature. It makes recording shows so much easier.
-The Viewtv does not label your programs once they are recorded on your external hard drive, it only labels recorded programs using the channel (CBS, NBC, etc...and the time and date recorded. You can rename shows afterward but its kind of a pain to have to keep a notepad by your couch to keep tabs on this.",06-18-2014,06-18-2014

I changed the brand of SD card, thinking I needed a faster memory for the high-speed write, but Class 10 card didn't change the breakup.

I have only had my device for two+ weeks.  All's well so far, but what if I need help?  The warranty sheet lists an address for returns (163 Imlay St., Brooklyn, NY 11231) but that appears to be a stationery store.  It also lists a Customer Service number, 1-866-948-6079, but there is no answer.  It's hard to feel confident about a product the makers and distributors hide from.  BUT...myViewTV is working and doing what they claimed it would.  Here are some must-knows:
a.) You must provide your own antenna.
b.) If you want to record shows to watch later, you must attach a USB storage device. Some people have external hard drives; I'm using an ordinary 32GB flat Sandisk inserted in a USB converter drive ($15).  I recorded from my TV and played back on the ViewTV.  There was plenty of space left on the disk after three movies and five hours of TV shows.  If you store  a lot of media, you might consider more gigabytes.
c.) If you don't want to record but you do want to pause, rewind and fast-forward live TV, you must attach a USB external storage device.  (See b)  Your storage device is where ViewTV buffers the live signal until you are ready to watch again.
d.) This is not your cable company's DVR box.  Things will work differently.  You'll get used to it.

The following is my attempt to address the chief complaints given by reviewers who gave ViewTV a one-star score:

1. It did not record, even when TV signal was strong
--Did the person have an external storage drive attached to the device or not? ViewTV has no internal storage.

2. ...it accepts only NSTC signals that, of course, are no longer broadcast OTA.
--It does indeed accept ATSC (digital) signals over the air.  Either this person received a dud or the settings aren't correct.

3.  piece of junk...not worth the money. I have a new TV that does not need the box to receive digital channels...
--Well, this person had no need for the ViewTV box, but you might. I also picked up the same number of channels, but I needed it for its PVR function, so it's not junk to me.

4.  Sound stopped working..The problem is not with the TV since the HDMI port is shared with a three-way adapter and sound works fine from the other two.
--There's something to this. My sound stopped working, too, after I programmed my Harmony One universal remote (a 2-star product at best) to take over commands from ViewTV and let the receiver handle sound. ViewTV may not like multiple interfaces.  After applying several strategies, I finally gave up and reprogrammed the remote to bypass the receiver. Now my sound is back.

5. Recording looks like a pixelated mess.
--If the OTA signal is a pixelated mess, so will your recording be a pixelated mess. ViewTV cannot de-pixelate a bad signal.

6. The remote also is one of the worst I've used.
--There is a learning curve you will need to work through.  Two examples: (1) the Guide button is labeled EPG for Electronic Program Guide.  (2) You must press the Hold button after you press Play when watching a recording.  Otherwise, it will play in review (small screen) mode. It's important to note that ViewTV does not have its own guide.  Your guide will look like what your networks are already broadcasting OTA.",05-21-2014,05-21-2014

It seems a bit clunky with eliminating channels but I figured it out it just takes some extra steps. Timer works well. Button placement seems haphazard example Fast Forward and Play are not even close so you must look at remote each time. It sounds petty but it is a real pain if you have ever had a system that was well thought out. That is my only reason for only 4 stars.,05-18-2014,05-18-2014

It's pure Chinese manufacturing of absolutely the lowest possible quality (one of the four base pads was missing), but it's only of interest to the US market. The rest of the world doesn't need this -- they simply stick USB devices into their TVs and record directly. It's only in the US that a combination of cartel patents and corrupt politicians makes recording of OTA TV extremely expensive and difficult. When we buy a Samsung TV, for example, the recording features are disabled.

In China this is probably used to convert digital signals for the few analog TVs left in China. It probably costs $10 to make, including what I assume is a very low quality (risky!) internal switched power supply (no power brick). In the US it's sold, somewhat covertly, as a low cost no-subscription simple digital TV recorder.

The good news is that if you ignore the manual, and work through the incredibly crude displays hacked to to show English labels, and convert from the strings on the weird remote to the screen, it's not hard to configure this. You can even set up the antenna as pass-through so the signal goes to the ViewTV and is also available for TV input. It does record (!) and you can play back the recording. It even shows a list of available TV shows.

The bad news is that the tuner in my device sucked. OTA Digital TV barely works in many US settings -- we need top notch tuners. The one in our Samsung Smart TV gets barely enough channels to meet my son's sporting thirst. The tuner in this device missed most of them.

I also do worry about the internal switched power supply. This ships with all the usual inspection/certification labels, but I'd be amazed if any of them were legitimate.

If only they'd shaved their profit margin a bit. It costs nothing to build what's in this box. We actually own a decent (Chinese made of course) Digital TV converter box that cost $45 -- it's far higher quality than this with a far better tuner.

I hope someone else will do that -- but we have to remember the reason these features are disabled from US TVs. Anyone doing this properly is going to be hit by the US OTA patent cartel -- and forced to charge high subscription fees.

There may not be anything better in the near future. So if you have a strong antenna and good signals, and you're feeling lucky, it's worth a shot. Just be ready to return, and  if you're feeling nervous leave it unplugged when you're not using it.",05-17-2014,05-17-2014

1.  My intention was to use this on the TV in my basement so I wouldn't have to have it on my main TV, adding yet another box on my entertainment center.  The plan was to use it to record, and then carry the recording on the thumb drive to my Western Digital Media player to watch.  As it turns out, the DVR records in ""blocks"" of 511 megabytes, so recording the 24 series opener gave me 25 files.  Only the first file was named with a "".mts"" extension.  That one plays fine.  All the rest of the files are named "".mts1"" "".mts2"" "".mts3"" and so on.  So, to play each of the files on any source other than the DVR, I had to rename all the files to "".mts"".

2.  File naming.  The recorded files only show the station ID and time stamp.  It makes no sense to me that if there is an electronic program guide and the ability to rename files manually (both of which work great by the way), why the unit can't name the recording using the name of the show.

3.  Clunky remote.  I'm never lost because the on-screen prompts that show what you can do, but seriously, why would I press ""hold"" to go full screen?  how about a button that says ""full screen"" or something intuitive.  I bought this as a test for my Mother in Law, and she will eventually pick up on the visual cues, but it needs to be made more user friendly.

All in all, a good buy.  I'll probably be buying another one shortly.

Update 5-13:

I gave it another go with a faster USB hard drive, and this time, the entire program recorded in one file.  It would be nice to know why.  I can only speculate as to why.  I hope the manufacturer is reading this.  Anyway, MAKE SURE you have a fast flash drive.  My original USB drive gave hiccups every few seconds.  Now it works fine.

Update 1/21/16:

unit has been having issues for a while now.  About two months ago, the coax input quit working, so I had to eat up an HDMI port to support it.  It quit turning on with the remote, although turning off and all other functions were fine.  It has frozen up a couple of times in the last week or so, and finally just shut off with no sign of life.

I still recommend this device.  I bought it on May 3, 2014 for 59.99.  That is still less than one month of service with any cable provider and has provided me nearly two years of good service.  I just ordered another one to replace it, and now they're 32.99.  Good going ViewTV :).",05-12-2014,05-12-2014

Good sharp picture and sensitive tuner. It would be nice if they also included a usb port on the rear of the unit instead of just the front. The other thing that I did not like was the fact that when you want to scan any new over the air digital tv channels into memory there is no feature that lets you 'add' those new channels in - it just overwrites everything all over again. And one last thing - if you have an Android media box, like the G-Box MX2, I noticed that some of the IR remote control buttons are of the same frequency as the IR remote of this tuner which means that you are accidently 'doing things' (changing channels, settings, etc.) to this or that box. However a situation like this can easily be 'fixed' because the G-Box lets you use a 2.4 ghz RF remote instead of the IR one - all you need to do is put a piece of dark tape over the IR sensor on the G-Box to prevent it from picking up the IR signals from the tuner IR remote to solve the problem. Overall I would recomend this product to a friend.",05-10-2014,05-10-2014

Although tedious to program a recording, it's a great little device to watch TV with. Not only will it convert ATSC signals, but it also provides an HDMI and component output with excellent picture quality. However, on the down side, the remote is very awkward to use, often requiring several key presses to do a simple task-very tedious. Remote operation can lock up and it's functions are not intuitive. It often fails to record as scheduled, and sometimes it will stop recording after a few minutes, while at other times, it records as planned. I've tried various recording media with the same result. I've also tried two HomeWorx units and they share the same faults and attributes. I returned the Viewtv unit and may do the same with the HomeWorx units. These different brands also seem to share the same electronics which may explain why I experienced the same characteristics with both brands. Now, other features that are hard to deal with: A 24 hour clock; Recording names are by date and time only, not the show's name; Odd, remote function names that make for awkward use.

I also noticed that the box keeps dropping the channel names after you spend your time naming them, FOOD becomes PR-SC00071. This is very inconvenient, especially when you have hundreds of channels, but you want to only watch 8-10.",04-23-2014,04-23-2014

(after much fiddling and resetting over the last week, it's now recording my scheduled show but locking up 99% of the time. My original unit would record reliably until the disk filled up)

The first one lasted almost exactly one year so i thought I'd buy a replacement and it would work the same. Opened the old failed unit and there appeared to be traces blown open on the PCB in several places.... my initial guess is that the trace widths for the 5V USB are barely sufficient. So I thought even if I have to buy a new one every year, it's still better than supporting the morons at TiVo who have made it nearly impossible to bring a competitive product to the market. Alas, the replacement arrived and things are not looking quite so good
- the remote uses different IR codes so it no longer works with my universal remote (is spent quite some time finding an equivalent device for my remote and I'm just not prepared to repeat the exercise)

- I don't know why they redesigned the it.... is worse than the previous generation and even more directional (which is really saying something)

- the new unit wouldn't play any of my previous recordings. Well, it did play one once, but never again.

- then the schedule no longer works (this is the sep 3 2014 firmware). I've tried reformatting, deleting and reprogramming the recording schedule, all to no aval. I only have a single item on my recording list and it's supposed to record every day - it recorded once on the first day, but never since. It still seems to record OK if I program a once only recording, but that isn't really much use particularly when the previous version worked fine.

- this one locks up even more than the previous version. I could power down and back up again using the remote to recover on the previous version, but this one locks up on reboot almost every time when I use the remote. Now I have to get up, walk over and pull our the power cord virtually every time I try to get this thing working.

-the main reason for my downgrade (apart from the fact that this is no longer fit for use!) Is that this company actually had a really good product which they've turned into a really crappy product through ""upgrades"", all of which appear to have contributed to an inferior product. Oh, I also resent the already marketing pretending this is reduced from $99 and is therefore a great value. I got our for $50+ a year ago and it was actually worth that price. This time it's being sold for $34 and it's now worth $0 IMHO.

Unfortunately I threw away the packaging anticipating the same product, so I'll keep experimenting with USB drives/formatting etc and update this review if I can get any normal functionality out of this thing. What a shame.

when TiVo tried to extort an extra ~$6/month in order to record in HD (the guide information provided by the service would have been identical and I owned the player outright) and removed my recording ability because I was two weeks late on my annual renewal, I decided I'd try and fine something ....anything....to prevent feeding this litigious monster which has deprived the marketplace of any serious competition. Other than eyetv or setting up a computer to record OTA broadcast, this little beauty came to my attention and I was finally able to free myself from the mafia tactics of both comcast (with their asinine encryption of OTA broadcasts and resulting inferior quality than I get with a $20 antenna) and the ludicrous business model and bullying tactics of TiVo. Good riddance to both of them. btw I didn't even know that tv guide/recording schedules were broadcast ota for free until I got this - I was paying TiVo roughly $150/year for something that's in the air we breath. It does lock up occasionally, but I can handle that better than extortion :-)",03-24-2014,03-24-2014

But with a $30 pricetag (after $30 promotion which was applied at checkout) I really can't argue too much against it.

Setting it up and programming it took a bit of time since the manual is pretty useless, but I was able to figure it out.  The remote is weird, but if you have a learning remote you can map the keys to ones that make more sense to you.  The tuner is less sensitive than the one in my HDTV, so rather than using the loop-through function (and thus bypassing the tuner in the HDTV) I used a splitter to split the antenna feed to both tuners, which is working really well.  The EPG is pretty good.  For reasons unknown, the display shows a sequential channel number instead of the broadcast channel number; not sure what thinking was in that decision.  I bought this unit for the recording capability, not to use as a primary tuner, so the channel number doesn't bother me.

I like that it can record in 1080 if desired, and will also record in 720 or 480 to save space or for older shows.  A half-hour show at 480 uses about 2 gb of space.  I plugged in a 16 gb flash drive, let the unit format it (FAT32) and set up some shows to record.  With a flash drive, the unit is COMPLETELY SILENT when it turns on, records, and turns off, which I really appreciate for night-time or early-morning recordings (the unit is in my bedroom and I am a light sleeper).  The display is a bit bright so I put a piece of cardboard over it to block it when the lights come on at night.

For those who are not techy at all, this is not an easy plug-n-play unit, so you may want to look for something else.  To be honest, I looked at units costing over $200 (such as the Magnavox HD/DVD recorder, which records to DVD ONLY in SD) and decided the hassle of this unit was fairly minor.  I was prepared to pay $60, but this really is a steal at $30.",01-31-2014,01-31-2014

It can be used with old 4:3 Aspect Ratio TV's and the newer 16:9 Aspect Ratio High Definition TV's.

The ViewTV At-163 is capable of using an external USB hard drive to save TV Programs (the manufacturer claims that USB flash drives can also be used).

I am using a ViewTV At-163 with a 2.5"" Apple Hard Drive, and it works without problems.  The ViewTV At-163 feeds enough power to the Apple Hard Drive via the USB connection, and there is no need to use the Apple Hard Drive's power connector.

The ViewTV At-163 is easy to program for TV recording, by just pressing the TIMER button on the remote, and setting up the TV program information.  TV program recording can be set up using the following frequencies: Daily, weekly, and once.

The TV programs that have been saved on the hard drive will appear by pressing the MENU button on the remote, and selecting the USB menu, then the PVR menu, and last the HBPVR folder (this folder is automatically created by the Converter Box).  The TV programs that have been saved in the HBPVR folder are listed using file names which include the channel's name, the date: month, day, year, and time (24 hr format time in which recording was started).

The Hard Drive must be formatted as an NTFS file system, formatting the hard drive as a FAT32 file system will save the TV Programs in multiple segments, whereas NTFS will provide a single file.  I formatted my Apple Hard Drive using a PC.

After connecting the Hard Drive to a Computer running Video Processing Software, I could determine that the ViewTV At-163 connected to a 4:3 Aspect Ratio Projection TV saves TV Programs using the following:

Video Format: MPEG2, at a Display Resolution of 704x480, at a Bit Rate of 2984 Kbps
Sound Format: AC3, at a Bit Rate of 192 Kbps
A 1 hour recording requires approximately 1.34 GB.

The player has fast forward and reverse speeds of 2X, 4X, 8X, 16X and 32X.

The time is automatically set by the converter box, and one of the menus has a Daylight Savings Time function that must be set to 'on' accordingly.

The files saved can be seen neatly, and without lag.

The ViewTV At-163 is a 5 Star Product.",01-28-2014,01-28-2014

Here is my criteria:

1. Must be able to pull in weak signals from an outdoor antenna - Check.
2. Must have HDMI output AND Component outputs - Check.
3. Must have the ability to force the HDMI resolution to 720P - Check.
4. Must be relatively inexpensive - Check.

I have had several external HD tuners over the years (first to feed an HD monitor, and then a projector), and all have konked out or had various issues.  My latest tuner works fine for most stations, but then failed to receive the local Fox station that should have been no problem.  So all I was really looking for was a good, solid tuner, that just works.  I don't need the recording functions so I haven't even tried that part.

There are three ways I use this unit.  One is to feed the TV, so I use a short HDMI running 1080P for that.  The second was is to drive a projector that has a long HDMI cable run.  And with that run, it sometimes streaks when I try to push 1080P, so I drop it back to 720P for that, since the projector is only 720P anyway.  Then it works perfectly.  Third, I sometimes host a superbowl party with my projector at a different location from home, and when I use even a short HDMI cable, I sometimes get dropouts (the jack on the projector is most of the problem, as the cable has to be connected just right).  So for that, I use a component cable since it is rock solid and never drops out (and no one can tell it's not digital from 30 feet away).

As others have noted, this unit does have some quirks, but I expected that based on the cheap price and being an off-brand.  But I expected that it had some good modern chips in it, and that it my work for what I needed, and that turned out to be true.  The user manual is awful, of course, and the front panel shows a sequential number for the channel number instead of the actual channel number (there may be a setting to make it show the channel number, but I didn't find it).  The online program guide is actually pretty good compared to other units I've had.  The interface to set up recording appears a little clunky, but I haven't actually tried that yet, and don't plan to.  And note that to record you do need an external storage device of some sort.  When I went to set it up on my Harmony One remote, the manufacturer was not listed, so I had to set it up manually, which still wasn't too bad with the Harmony interface.

So, if you're looking for a super do-all device that is easy to use, this is not it.  But if you have specific requirements as I did, it may just be the perfect unit for you.",01-28-2014,01-28-2014

I am a cable customer and get most of the network channels on my kitchen HDTV without problem. I assumed that the tuner on this would work as well as the tuner on the TV. It didn't.

Some stations, like PBS and shopping channels came through, but others did not. Interestingly, I had different channel availability at different cable outlets in my house, but I never was able to pick up a station that I really wanted.

If you have an antenna, it may work, but don't expect much from cable. I didn't try the record feature, so can't state how well it works.

In general, this sounded pretty good for the price. In reality, it was too good to be true.

It only records in 480p and is limited to what the digital tuner feeds it.  This unit replaced it and is doing a stellar job.  The recording quality is excellent and is only limited by the capacity USB stick I use.  It caught the same number of channels as the TV does and works as advertised.  An improvement on this product would be to add an Ethernet port and play streaming media from a home server.  That would make this the only player I would need by my TV.

The only negatives I have are:
- The recording scheduler does not have a mon-fri option like the Toshiba does.  We record kid's programs during the week.  This unit will also record the same times on the weekend, which are not the same programs as during the week.
-The remote  could be better.  Specially the play, stop buttons which are usually clearly marked and prominent on other remotes.  Here they are little buttons in no specific order  near the bottom of the remote.

I wanted something of a better quality and more reliable. Right out of the box I noticed that the unit had light scratches on the top. I wonder if it had been returned previously. Batteries were not included with the remote (a bit cheap on the manufacturers part). Included HDMI cable was very short (~3ft). If you have a large screen TV and want to use this cable, converter box has to be placed right next to the TV or just below it. This renders the supplied cable useless to me. Converter itself was easy to set up and I compared it with reception I got from my 2009 Samsung TV and Magnavox SDTV converter box. I used an old indoor RCA amplified antenna (RCA ANT 200). I also have an amplified Philips antenna of the same age (~10 years old), but RCA has much better reception. With Samsung TV I was able to get ~50 channels (counting 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 etc. as separate channels). With Magnavox converter box I got a couple fewer. Viewtv apparently received 54 channels. When I went through them I noticed that some I was not able to receive (no signal), some were pay TV (""Scramble Channel"" - actual spelling on the screen) and some (Ion, qubo, QVC) were acquired twice at different frequencies. Overall, I was able to get ~40  different channels. I still intended to keep this unit, even though it may not have been the best purchase. However, I noticed that every few minutes the reception was lost. The picture would get pixelated and the sound was lost. That did not happen when I was using Samsung TV or Magnavox converter box. Finally, as I was switching antenna between different units, I noticed that this converter box was rather warm. After I let it run for ~1h it got so hot that touching antenna input or output could burn my hands. I am returning this unit. It is possible that I have got a defective one, but I don't think I will take chance with another one. I will probably try one of the less expensive models.",01-11-2014,01-11-2014

Knote""'s review is pretty spot on, check that out if you want specific details.  My primary use of this product initially was for recording of OTA TV programs, however the tuner is better than the one in my TV.

Pros:
- HD recording is seamless as long as the antenna signal is good.  Recorded onto a 2TB hybrid drive (8GB SSD cache) in a USB 3.0 enclosure, playing, pausing, skipping forward and reverse all performed well.  Note that any ticker info (such as weather alerts) that are added by affiliate channels will show in recordings, as well as the network identifiers in the lower corners.
- Can rename recordings unlike other comparable units, can't use spaces in names for some reason, but can use just about any other character as well as upper and lower case letters.
- Does not output much heat (however the plastic on top of the metal casing was VERY hard to peel off).
- Price: $70 on sale from $100 at time of purchase.

Cons:
- User interface is clunky and occasionally has delayed responses.
- Front channel display is of an internal identifier number, not the actual channel number, making it effectively useless outside of determining if you are watching a recording or live TV.
- Remote has un-intuitive button layout, when pausing a PVR recording or using timeshift, I have to look at the remote to find the play and pause buttons (which are separate), and they don't have common button shapes or locations on the remote (they are both buried in a 3x4 grid of 12 total buttons.
- Did not work well with my Yamaha RX-V473 (via HDMI), though that may be the receiver's issue.  Receiver wouldn't always find input, and when it did, it was pink as if the RGB levels were messed up.  Works fine when connected directly to the TV via HDMI.
- USB port is on the front.

However, my main problem with it is that I mainly wanted it to be a DVR with time shift and to record the occasional program.

For each of these 7 days set your channel and time you want to record then select ""Weekly"" for each of these seven days. When the May 1 recording finishes, it will reprogram itself for the same day the following week. Same thing for May 2 and so on. What you are having to do is program each day individually and set them to repeat the same day the following week. It is a bit frustrating having to do this 7 times instead of being able to simply select ""Daily,"" but so far it is working fine for me. For the price, I will happily spend the 5 extra minutes setting it up this way instead of shelling out nearly 7 times more plus a possible monthly service charge for a name brand unit.

Alas, Nikon totally blew the market analysis vs production vs. supply chain formula.  After waiting 2 months, I had to leave the country before Nikon got it's D800 act together. I needed a beat-up D90 replacement camera, and the D3200 seemed like a decent place-holder.  I quickly ordered one before they were back-ordered too!  Sure, the D3200 is DX, not FX.  Sure, it is not nearly as flexible.  Sure, it can only AF with newer lenses.  BUT, you can buy about 4-D3200's for the price of a D800, AND it comes with a decent kit lens for $699!

The tutoring graphical-based menu system is geared more to beginners, which I am not, so I find it maddening.  Most will love it, since it is somewhat educational, and offers a great variety of pre-sets to take creative shots easily.

It is amazingly light weight - lighter than most lenses! It is very quiet. The AF could be faster, but it's plenty fast enough. When you dig deeper, you shockingly find that the D3200 has many advanced internal features from the highest-end cameras (D800 & F4). The high-res LCD rear screen, the EXPEED 3 image processing engine, and a new 24MP sensor.  The EXPEED 3 image processing engine allows the D3200 to perform at an altitude unheard of for a so-called entry level camera.  Nikon's Active-D dynamic range enhancement at 24MP at 4 frames per second requires substantial in-camera processing power.

I bought this camera primarily for still photography. With the proper lenses & technique, the results are stunning.  Low-light/high ISO performance is far beyond what you should expect at this level camera. Candle-lit face images are noise-free, and look great. Still life's on a tripod at ISO 100, have more resolution that ANY DSLR I have ever used, with very little shadow noise.  In short, I might not accept my D800 when it becomes available.  I might use the D3200 longer than I thought, (waiting for the 24MP FX D600 for $1999 later this year -- my guesses on price & stats & date)...or, just keep using the D3200.  If it breaks (I'm hard on cameras), I'll just buy a new one.

Bottom line -- the D3200: super light-weight, very quiet, super high resolution (& low noise, high dynamic range, superb colors), incredible HD video with slow motion.  It is no doubt THE most amazing DSLR value on the planet!

5/14/12 UPDATE: I've now shot 100s of images, using lenses from 11 mm to 600 mm.  I've learned a lot.  Super-high resolution cameras are a new arena for most of us. On the surface, one automatically thinks you will get images with twice the resolution (12MP vs 24MP). Not so.  MP resolution is measured linearly, so the increase while significant, is less than doubled.  More importantly, when you enter the hi-res camera stratosphere, photographic technique & lens choice are critical. While these high MP cameras are capable of amazing results, you have to work to get absolutely ALL the MP's this camera has to offer.  Do not blame the camera if your initial results are less dramatically sharper than your old 6-8-12MP Nikon. It's probably you...
BTW, the Nikon 18-55mm is a decent lens, but it doesn't do this imager justice.  You can get better results, with better glass.  The excellent f1.8 35mm DX Nikon on this camera makes a super-light weight compact package you can carry all day long, producing super images.  A 60 year-old Nikkor Q 200mm f4, $70 or so on eBay, produces stunning results if carefully used on Manual, on a tripod.

Set-up a table with clean background and a few artifacts on it.  Use the sharpest lens you have,  at f 8, on a sturdy tripod, perpendicular to the table, Shoot the scene with the in-camera flash on both old & new camera bodies. You will see the difference easily when images from both cameras are compared side by side, enlarged to 100%.

How does this translate to everyday casual shooting?  Not easily. Sub-par technique still results in sub-par images no matter what camera is used.  If you are a beginner looking for the best entry-level DSLR ever made, all of this won't matter -- grab a D3200 and shoot away!  Just note that the D3200 is capable of world-class imagery.  If it takes more effort to take photographs of this caliber, it's a good thing -- the D3200 forces you to up your game to get there!

5/5/13 UPDATE.  It's been a year.  I have a D800 and a D3200.  Yes, there are many differences between the two.  One is at the high end of the spectrum, the other, entry level.  When I'm shooting commercially, or seriously in any way, it's the D800.  It is a superb camera, if you own glass that can fully exploit the 36MP sensor, and your technique is solid. For everything else, I use the D3200.  Why?  It's light and compact.  You can easily carry it around all day, with the f1.8 35mm, and hardly know it's there.  If that lens isn't wide enough, shoot a 3-frame series and stitch them together in Photoshop.  Again, with good glass and technique, the results are very, very good.  D800 territory? No, but few would notice. The D3200 is a pleasure to use, and handles fast enough for most kinds of photography. You can use old manual Nikkor lenses easily, albeit with a bit more effort.  With the focus confirmation dot in the viewfinder, manual focusing is easy.  Exposure can be guessed and adjusted using the great hi-res LCD.  I recently had to shoot an emergency-rush job covering a politician's speech. All I had in the car was the D3200, the 35mm f1.8, and an old, sharp 100mm f2.8 E Nikkor  -- my normal in-car-at all-times stash.  The setting was indoors, in a bright garden area -- no flash allowed.  I was surrounded by folks with Nikon D4's and $1500 lenses.  I got a few looks....LOL.  I boosted the ISO to 1600, used the $50 100mm @ f4 @1/125th, and the results were great, published in several places.  The D3200 is a great camera for the money, I like it more now than when I first bought it!",05-08-2012,05-08-2012

(ACR7.1 & LR 4.1 support RAW),"*** Update 6/12/2012 ***
After analyzing the result more, I found that, for this kind of camera, my Sharp lens at the sharpest aperture is required to get real amazing sharp picture to the pixel. My Tamron 17-50 VC F2.8 at F5.6 is required for edge to edge sharpness.
Also, Tokina 11-16 F.8 (which is manual focus with this camera), becomes more critical. Using the range finder mode is a must to get a tack sharp picture. That's new to me. But I am glad I learn the lesson. And now I am more happy with this camera (and lenses)...

*** Update 05/31/2012***
Update lightroom 4.1 today, now support NEF. And as expected despite the high resolution (24mp) cmos chips, the noise quality of D3200 is comparable with D5200.
Meaning that D3200 has advantage of having more real estate (meaning more room for cropping),hence still have the same IQ with D3200. And thanks to Expeed 3 (which is the processor they use in D800 and D4 and D3200), D3200 is a very responsive camera. Bravo Nikon!

************************

Just received this Camera today, and this is my preliminary Review (will update progresively).
Background: I have upgraded my Nikon Digital D100->D200->D90->D5100->D3200.
Okay, seemed I downgrade every single time, but actually not. (I also use D300, D3X, but those are different class of equipment). This path, is more for daily activity platform (lightweight).
D90 -> D5100: I actually considered to buy D7000, but chose D5100 simply because the price, and the articulated LCD because I use it 50% for Video. I am glad I did! D5100 image quality is SUPERB and on par with D7000. D5100 is lot FASTER than D3000 & D3100, but a little bit slower than D7000. From D90 to D5100, it has lots of improvement in image quality, low noise in low light, much better video (with 20 minutes max per session). The only drawback I can see, is the battery coverage is not long enough (on Video mode), but it is understandable, and the solution is add another spare.

D5100 -> D3200:
Other than the obvious layout design difference, the only thing I eager to know is the Low Light Noise!
So I am glad to report that IT IS COMPARABLE!

See my attached photo (The Costco Connection image) and judge yourself (both image are taken with the same setting at ISO 6400)

So, 3200 is a clear winner!

*** Update ***
I upload an image taken at ISO 12800 (Hi1). For me the image is very usable.
Will update the review in a couple of days, once I get the whole importance difference between 5100 & 3200 ...

*** Update After 200 shots ***
1. My copy of 3200 has slightly over exposure consistently (but not much, probably 1/3 ev, but I actually like slightly under exposed)
2. I noticed  a slight improvement of Dynamic range. I take a shoot at an overcast day, but surprise how it can capture the clouds, the trees and shadows
3. An improvement in response. It is slightly faster than 5100, but not in the same level as D7000.
4. Smoother Mirror, and quieter. It is noticable (but not sure if this is consistent between model, or just batch/production variance).

*** Update in Video ***
The Video is also amazing. It is comparable to D5100, especially the color rendetion is great!
The low light performance is on par with D5100.
The addition of 720p 60fps, and the Manual Audio Level control + Stereo Audio Meter is a real plus for Video Maker, making this DSLR a good choice for Serious Video taker. I wish it has a headphone Jack, but probably too much to ask for considering the price level. The focus tracking in Video mode is also improved, not substantially but good enough to be considered. I did 4 songs video clip and really satisfied with the result. Both the end result and the operational experience are great. I use the 720p 60fps mode for this project, and really like the result.
I noticed slightly longer battery time, but not sure whether this is consistent or only slight production/batch variance. (*** Update: I finally found that It is a batch variance, because the other battery I have give me noticable longer running time ***).

The additional Audio Meter view (press Info several time in the live view mode), is a really good addition for me, especially while attaching external Mic for Video mode (see my image). Also the option to set the Audio Level (Mic Input) is very useful. I took 10 Video clips already, and use the Mic Input to capture the Audio from A Mixer. The audio quality is SUPERB!

For all the test, I didn't use the kit lens, but use Tamron 17-50 F2.8 VC.",05-03-2012,05-03-2012

The camera is scarce right now especially the red model. I have the pleasure of getting the black model and all my other slr's are black so why break the mold as they say...

First the camera looks very similar to the Nikon d3100 with a improvements to the sensors of course at 24.3 megapixel. The details and contrasts of the pictures taken are deep and rich and very beautiful on they eyes. The lcd screen on seems to be improved, much more clearer and in high contrast.

I have the Sony A77 and this is my second Nikon joining my Nikon d5100. Since Canon has not came out with a high sensor that is affordable such as the 24.3 megapixel that the sony and Nikon now have. In no comparison the Sony a77 is much more expensive and you get what you pay for with it.

It started out as a great starter camera. I never had any issues with it until sometime last summer. 60%-90% of my photos have so much noise that theres hardly any detail. Ive tried changing many settings. My firmware is up to date. Ive contacted nikon support several times. They misheard me and thought I said my photos were coming out greenish (not sure why they thought that especially since I corrected them multiple times). They asked me to send raw photos to them so they could identify my problem. I sent them and they wrote back saying they didn't see the green issues I was having. I wrote back and said my issues noise not green that was at least 2-3 weeks ago and I haven't heard back. Ive talked to other photographers whove had this camera and a lot of them said they had the same problem after a while. They never could figure out what was wrong with it and were forced to upgrade. Its frustrating because I started doing photo shoots with it. Ive had to refund money and turn potential clients away because of these issues. On top of the terrible noise issue, My shutter response has become incredibly delayed. Sometimes Ill snap the picture and it will take right away. Other times itll take 30 seconds or more before it will allow me to take a photo after I first start trying. I was a die hard Nikon fan but after this experience I will never recommend this series to anyone.",11-26-2017,11-26-2017

WIth that being said I absolutely love this camera. It's build quality is that of any other good DSLR that I've used, and I can already tell that with proper care and maintenance this camera should last me a lifetime. Also, for this price I'm incredibly happy with both the lenses. The primary lenses that I use s the 15-55mm lens that has the VR on it, and I can tell you that you can achieve some amazing things with that lens when used properly. Also, the second lens that comes with this kit is extremely good for portraiture among other things that you would typically use long lenses for. however, I really wished that I had the Vibration Reduction on the longer lens rather than the shorter lens due to the shake you naturally get without a tripod with the longer lens. This is fine however, as long as you use this lens properly and learn what this camera can do this small fact isn't all that much of an issue at all. Overall, I've been told by my professor that a lot of my photos I've taken with this camera are professional grade, and there are many cameras that aren't as good as this one that're still being used in the professional setting. If you're a student and you want the best bang for your buck then I think you've found it, but if you're not looking to use this camera for a potential career then you can definitely get away with being much cheaper.

On a side note, if you don't know much about cameras and this is your first time buying a DSLR make sure to do a lot of research and at least have a vague idea of what you like to take photos of. This camera really suits me in the way that it's very good at portraiture with it's high MP, but also amazing at action photography. If you're looking for only using it for portraiture and aren't interested in doing any photography of moving things I think you'd be better suited with a Cannon DSLR due to their better lenses overall.",03-23-2017,03-23-2017

It doesn't have some of the flexibility as more advanced cameras, but I was able to purchase this camera with two refurbished lenses (18-55mm & 55-200mm), a nice carrying case, a modest set of filters with a lens hood, and an extra battery for $500.

I have one.
HOWEVER...beware that this bundle comes with a lens that is non-VR.
VR stands for Vibration Resistance.
Unless you plan on taking still shots with a tripod and remote, then the lens will prove itself useless to you.
To hand hold a camera with a non-VR lens produces images that look out of focus
That's because it is impossible to hold a camera without your hand having some degree of shaking/movement.
I recommend spending the extra for a VR lens.
In my opinion, I think that manufacturers should make it clear to consumers that non VR lenses have limited functionality.
I have known a few beginners who have put money into their cameras/lenses, not knowing the significance of
this, and so disappointed that their photos aren't crisp and focused.",08-26-2016,08-26-2016

My wife loves it! It is easy to use and a great beginner camera. Now she wants more lenses........

It is only 24 megapixels which is way better than a phone camera, but not as high quality as professional photos for magazines like Vogue. Really the only difference where this comes into play is if you want to make a picture extremely large like on a billboard or zoom way far in and print that zoomed in portion.

You are able to manually control the aperture, shutter speed, ISO (sensitivity to light), flash, white balance, focus (with a ring on the lens or on the back of the camera), change to conious focus or single foucs, change to continuous shooting (so multiple shots), self-timer, the size of the files recorded (Camera RAW/JPEG Fine down to JPEG basic), and the color space.

This DSLR also includes video settings, which you can control to some degree as well! Pretty cool, and you can even go in and change the microphone settings at a basic level.

There is a flash on the top attached to the body, and it is fairly easy to switch out lenses and buy different lenses. It also has a hotshoe for external flash so you can add different lighting set-ups to the camera. It does have some automatic features, to help those who have no idea how to use the manual features.

It includes and instruction manual and the standard zoom lens. The instruction manual is actually really organized and clear/easy to understand. Although I still found listening to videos and practising helped my wife the most.

I attached some photos she has been able to take on this camera so you can see what this camera is capable of.",06-03-2016,06-03-2016

I wanted to get a dlsr and am a bit of a budget now, and just could not spend the $500-$700+ on the Canon I was eying.

I have known of Nikon for years and knew they were great quality, and what made me buy this is a co worker who has a higher end D5000 I think it is, and inspired me to go d this and do hours of research.

I am very happy with this. It takes amazing pics and videos, has all the features I could ever ask for and I am just loving the digital aspect of this yet with the feel of an old slr.

It is very easy to use, has great battery life, is lightweight. I highly recommend this to anyone starting out or like me going from old school slr to dslr, or someone that wants a versatile camera that can do many things well.

The one thing I really love is getting back to the speed of the button/shutter when taking pics. I had some point and shoots for several years, and they do take great pics, but, just so much lag when hitting the button to capture a picture.",05-14-2016,05-14-2016

Both cameras are able to take terrific photos and there is very little difference between them.  As a result, the D3200 may be the best bargain in photography.  You can get a camera and zoom lens capable of taking ""pro"" quality photos for half the price of similar cameras.

A bonus is that the D3200 is much lighter than most cameras of similar quality.  That means you can carry it all day when you are traveling somewhere interesting, and not be tempted to leave it back at the hotel.  Its light weight and superb ""auto"" mode make it a good travel camera, but it also has advanced features that let you grow as a photographer.

Amazon has many camera vendors.  Some sell official USA Nikon cameras with a full USA warranty.  Other vendors sell ""grey market"" Nikon cameras that do NOT have the Nikon USA warranty.  That warranty is very valuable, so do not buy a Nikon camera without it.",04-29-2016,04-29-2016

I'm taking close up indoor product photographs for website use, with plenty of lighting. Unfortunately every picture turns out blurry, looking like they've been shot with a circa 2002 3.0mp camera. They may as well have been taken with a potato. My iphone 5s takes better pictures than this camera. I've tried every setting possible, ISO 100, 200, close-up, auto-focus, the whole 9 yards.

https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-Digital-18-55mm-3-5-5-6-Focus-S/dp/B007VGGFZU?th=1,35,Electronics,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Auto Focus-S DX VR NIKKOR Zoom Lens (Black) (OLD MODEL),4.6,5,Dollar for dollar it's hard to beat,"Probably the best starter DSLR on the market, of any brand, as of December 2015. Yes, there is a newer model (the d3300) available, but if you can save $100 I'd still get this one. The new model is unnoticeablely lighter, allows you to shoot 1 fps faster if needed, and gives you the ability to create panoramics in-camera (plenty of free software is out there for that already), and the ISO goes up even higher (although the image quality is terrible at those high ISO's on both models). Is that all really worth the price increase for an entry level crop-sensor dslr... most likely not.

Features: You get all the basic features you need. They don't overload this model with tons of features most people will never use. The omission of all the fancy, little used features unless you're into a specific style of photography creates a learning curve for this camera that is fairly easy, especially if you have any background using camera controls.
Side note: This camera requires AF-S lenses to autofocus since it does not have a built in-camera focus motor. Not a huge issue (both lenses that come with it are AF-S), just something to be aware of. The biggest complaint I read on lens reviews is certain lenses being only manual focus with this camera. That's because they bought an AF lens when they needed an AF-S lens, and really no fault of either product.

Build: Very quality build, both in materials and design. It's not weather sealed, but I wouldn't take my weather sealed full frame cameras out in the rain either if I didn't have to, so this doesn't affect me much.

Image/Video quality: Plainly put, both are wonderful. Full HD video with the push of a button is great, and still something a few pro Nikon's still don't do (I'm looking at you D7--).  The picture quality is wonderful in shooting conditions with adequate light. To be fair, any lighting issues with this camera tend to fall more on the lenses than the camera itself. 24.2MP is way more than you need to produce quality images. Megapixel count is more of a marketing gimmick nowadays unless you're blowing up photos to cover an entire wall in a house.

Lenses included: These are Nikon's plasticy kit lenses. Months/years from now if you move into full-frame phtography both these lenses will work on your new camera, just not well... but that's a big ""if"" you decide to buy that level of camera. With that being said, they are extremely sharp lenses that will cover an adequate range for most of your shooting. Don't forget, crop sensors (like this camera, and most other budget dslr's have) actually magnify the lens coverage (and not degrade the picture quality), so the 200mm lens you get will work more like a 300mm lens. that's plenty of zooms for what most people need. Both lenses included should treat you well.
A big bonus, this camera accepts all the pre-AI prime lenses Nikon made, some being 50 years old now! These are some phenomenal lenses you can buy on most auction sites for very cheap.

Overall: It easily earns five stars. Ease of use and image quality are all top notch. Owning Nikon's nicest DSLR's for my photography business (I currently own D4's, D810's, and a D610) I purchased one to test out and ended up using it for personal use for about half a year, loving every second of it. Would I recommend this to a professional? No. Would I recommend this to any of my friends looking for a great dslr without spending thousands of dollars? Yes... and it would be my first choice.

Just shooting the family? Are you a student looking to take a photography class? This might be your best choice.

WARNING: VERIFY THE MODEL YOU ARE BUYING IS A USA VERSION. Easiest way to confirm: 99% of these have a serial number (on the bottom of the camera) starting with a 3. Import (aka Grey Market) Nikon's are often bought MUCH cheaper buy non-legit sellers and then sold again to you. If they are the import model, you should be paying a LOT less. And keep in mind, Nikon's warranties do not apply to ANY import model. In fact, their service centers WILL NOT TOUCH OR FIX an import model no matter where or when you bought it... they will just mail it back to you, at your expense. If it breaks or has any issue, you have no other option than to buy a new camera.",12-29-2015,12-29-2015

This camera works very well and we have never had any problem with it. The two lenses that came with the camera is decent for everyday photos, but you will need to upgrade to better lenses to get the most out of this camera. I bought the 18-140mm DX lens to use with this camera and it is absolutely stunning. Photos are sharp and clear, with very low noise level. The 24 megapixel sensor in this camera will satisfy 99% of your photography applications with plenty of pixels to crop. The settings are relatively easy to use, but be aware that some commonly used settings (ex: auto focus mode) are still buried in the menu. Also, more focusing points can be nice welcome and will help you frame your subject better. I really like how light weight the camera is since this will be very good for travelling. Shooting with a heavier camera hurts my fingers at the end of the day. Honestly, I think this camera can easily rivals any other APS-C cameras in term of image quality. Since this is a consumer grade camera, it won't have the nice build of more professional cameras. But regardless, it is a solid camera and will get the job done.",12-27-2015,12-27-2015

Digital devices tend to make me angry. However, I took a leap of faith and bought this bundle, when the price was deeply reduced, because I am sick of the many limitations of my cell phone camera. I am pleased with my purchase overall, with a few caveats. Picture quality on this Nikon is excellent, the feel of the camera is comfortable and light in the hands (if a bit too plasticky), buttons and toggles seem to be in logical positions (for a right-handed person, at least). The lenses seem to be well made, but I'm not sure I can judge that, as my point of reference is the equivalent-length, pre-digital, fully mechanical lens that makes these plastic-casing lenses feel cheap. Once you know where everything is on the camera, and how to get the functions and images you want, it all feels very WYSIWYG. However, until you have learned the ropes, it is nearly impossible to see the icons on the different settings and functions. This camera is made for young eyes, which is annoying for middle-aged me. The printed instructions are written for an utter neophyte (how to hold a camera and stand to take a photo, for instance), so it's easy enough to find out what to do. But why go with an icon the size of an ant when you could use an easily-seen color, or letter? It's frustrating. The editing software that comes with thus is useless, so my husband told me after he tried to install it. He checked various boards online and found many complaints about it saying much the same thing, so I guess I'll be using another program. I do wonder, too, why these things are never sold with memory cards, or why Amazon doesn't link one in the ""often bought together"" option. I stole one from my husband's stash of digital goodies (he says to me, with just the tiniest bit of an eye roll, that memory cards are never included with these things, so silly me).",12-04-2015,12-04-2015

The only drawback I have is that the camera won't let you take anymore photos when the batter still has juice left due to ""low battery"".. I want to be able to run my battery all the way down to 0% while I'm taking photos. I was unprepared for this when I first started using it and was bummed that I had to stop taking photos sooner than I anticipated because the camera literally locks the shutter and doesn't let you take anymore while there's still plenty of battery left. There may be some reason for Nikon to do this, but I have no clue what it is. Besides this, it's a great quality camera!",10-09-2015,10-09-2015

The teacher I learned from only used Nikon because of the quality and reputation. That was good enough for me. I bought an Nikon FM. The light meter would drain the batteries whether on or off so I just stopped using that. Anxious to try the new digital format I bought a D50 DSLR when it came out..I loved that camera. DSLR was light years past film cameras! And no processing!  Sadly, that camera and my equipment was stolen. I bought a Nikon wallet sized camera for the time being.

When Nikon announced the D3200 and D5200 with 24 MP I went out and bought one. Almost from the beginning I had problems with it. It would often refuse to fire no matter what the setting or mode. I assumed I was the problem and thought ""I really should read those instructions."" I wasn't taking a lot of pictures. The problem persisted, even getting worse. It would focus in and out, then nothing. Sometimes I couldn't get even ONE picture. I took it to Nikon repair, by now out of warranty. They didn't find anything wrong but charged me 1$160.00 to clean it and align the mirror. That didn't fix it. It still wouldn't fire. I took it back to Nikon repair, this time taking the lens. It took weeks before it was ready. They told me the lens was bent and that cost me another $250.00 in repairs (I could have bought one online for as little as $25.00), And again, that did not fix the problem. I now have over $900 in a camera that won't take pictures!  Now I don't trust the Nikon brand and have to start researching, looking for another DSLR.",09-25-2015,09-25-2015

I often missed the shots I was going for, or they were blurry.  But I no longer have this problem.  This camera is priced just right to be a nice camera that I can easily take great pictures of my fast moving daughter instead of paying studios a fortune for, but is still simple enough and priced low enough that you don't have to be a pro photographer or takes tons of classes, or spend your life savings to afford.",09-18-2015,09-18-2015

I was on the fence between this and saving up for the 7100 and I wish I hadn't bought it since it's barely better than a point and shoot. The new LG G4 phone camera is better than this! Within 90 days the mirror broke and had to be sent back to Nikon. I ""upgraded"" from a d80 to find that half the features on a camera almost 10 years its senior were missing. The body is plasticky, and to be honest the pictures aren't worth the 24MP. My d80 gets sharper, clearer, and better colored images, now if only they weren't so noisy. That's the only positive difference. The 18-55, well there's a reason you see them everywhere, ditch it. The terrible sigma version is even an improvement. Again, cheaply made, poor quality, and the glass is dire - photos lack color and have a bluish tint that makes them look washed out. Also it won't work with my older speedlites or manual ones either.

I am upgrading from a d60 so everything it new to me. It does serve it's purpose, and for beginning or casual photographers, this is perfect, better in many ways than the 3300 in a few points: 1. The 3300 is smaller, like the cannon sl1, and those are way too small for my hands (I am a middle sized guy) so I like the larger form factor, I hate the feel of mirrorless and the superlight cameras. 2. The low pass filter, while it kills a tid bit of sharpness, can lead to more appealing pictures, and without spending 2-4 times the price of the body on glass, you are not going to get more than 10mpx in sharpness in your shots anyway. It is good in terms of all the shooting options, the AF is fairly fast, not super sports fast. The kit lens with this kit is okay, I got a 55-300 (not much better I know) and they work well for my beginning work. Nice thing is, the sellback price is pretty high if I ever want to go full-frame, but also I would not mind passing this on to a friend, as it will likely last many years. The kit lens on this one is, to my mind, sharper than the kit lens on a 3300, just becuase it is more spread out in the elements and gives you room to get a hand on the lens.",07-11-2015,07-11-2015

I was leery about trying a ""refurbished"" digital camera since in the past I have had horrible luck with refurbished electronic. Since I still had decent Nikon lens from my prior D3100 DSLR camera from several years ago [and that camera did a miserable job for me], I thought I would give the slightly updated D3200 model out using the lens from my old Nikon D3100 camera I no longer have. So far with some learning using Program and a little bit of Auto modes, my photos on this DSLR camera have been quite stunning with great detail qualities I was hoping for! Once you learn a bit about this camera, you should be fine. Lucky there is a full AUTO mode if you are leery about using some manual controls. I have various settings I mastered on my Canon SX-50HS super zoom digital camera and applied those settings on this Nikon digital camera with pretty good luck so far. Outdoor photos in the daylight are quite good once you get the right lens on the camera. Scenic photos outdoors are very good during the day. Indoor photos using flash are quite good, as long as you don't get too close to the subject. Overall the camera is easy to use and menu system is a bit complicated but not overly complicated. I have not tried video yet on this camera, so I cannot comment on that. I got a few extra batteries and 1 extra charger for this camera. Battery life on this camera is pretty good, especially for daytime outdoor photos. Batteries do take quite awhile to recharge....but lucky they last quite awhile in the camera. SD, SDHC and SDXC cards are used in this camera. I use class 4 or 10 SD cards of 16 gigabytes or higher with this camera. This is a very good entry level DSLR camera for those like me that is still learning more about the operations of DSLR cameras and if you want to enter DSLR photography & get pretty good photos, this camera is a pretty good one to get. Since I had Nikon lens from the prior version D3100 still, those lens fits on this D3200 camera perfectly and saved me quite a bit of money that way, avoiding buying more lenses. I gave this camera 5 of 5 stars.",06-29-2015,06-29-2015

I already had this in the black when I bought it in the red (not on Amazon). I was kind of embarrassed at my mistake, but so far I'm the only one to know about it. I figure I now have the added security of a backup DSLR and can get my old D70s converterd to IR once I have money for that.

My first DSLR was the D70s and I got that one when my daughter was a baby (she's now 9 1/2). I found a regular point and shoot to be insufficient at capturing those wonderful baby moments, so I forked over the money for my first DSLR and gave my brother my p&s.

This is considered an ""entry-level"" DSLR, but that doesn't mean it takes less than ideal pictures. It means this is what you start with, which is great, but if you suspect you're serious about a career in photography, you can test the waters by investing in a kit like this. At the very least you'll have a great camera to take on vacation.

I can't say enough good things about DSLR photography. Yes, it can be frustrating, but no more so than your standard p&s photography. There is a bit of a learning curve, but the pictures you'll be able to produce will be worth it.",06-28-2015,06-28-2015

The price makes it really accessible, it's very easy to use, small enough and light enough that it's easy carry around anywhere, and it take some really great images.  Not a huge improvement on the 3100 overall, but in some key areas it's much better.  Way more MP's (24 and change vs. 14), an infrared receiver for a remote, and it has a mic jack for recording video which for me made a huge difference.  The lens is ok, but definitely upgrade as soon as you can, as you start feeling the limitations of the 18-55 quick.

If I would have one recommendation for prospective purchasers, it would be to ""first"" purchase David Busch's book (Amazon) on the Nikon D3200.  In my case, the 18-55mm kit lens that came with the camera really wasn't the best for what I wanted to do with the camera.  So after purchasing an additional macro lens, I am taking great close ups.  Compared to the point and shoot, I am in awe of the image quality from this camera.  BTW, there's nothing wrong with the basic 18-55mm kit lens, it's great for general photography.  This particular camera was a Nikon ""Certified Refurbished Product"" at a lower price than a new camera.  Everything functioned perfectly and there was absolutely no handling marks to indicate it had ever been used.  However, the printing on the outside of the Nikon battery was well worn and I notice that it does hold a charge for as long I expected.  I guess they cut corners somehow to offer a reduced price?  All in all, I'm very happy with the camera and the price.",05-25-2015,05-25-2015

I'm a self-employed videographer that recently entered the world of professional photography. Being on a small budget as an aspiring photographer, I find that this camera perfectly meets my needs, earning me some good quality photos and income without costing me a fortune.

At first, I was an average camera user until my regular digital camera died on me. At that time, I was asked by clients if I do photography and so I said yes, and from there, I taught myself professional photography in just a few weeks on this wonderful Nikon series camera.

What's amazing is that I've bought this Nikon D3200 and using this for the first time, I must say it made a great first impression on me.

PERFORMANCE: 5/5
Nikon D3200 features great image quality with 24.2MP and a great ISO. It has a pretty fast shutter speed and it is great to be able to switch between manual and automatic controls.

Image quality: 5/5
Overall, good image depending on the lighting environment. Photo quality is great under a well-lit atmosphere using the built-in flash but I recommend using an external flash. Images aren't quite Paparazzi-worthy but the photos this camera takes will blow you away, nonetheless. It's a great camera for a first-time photographer looking to get their start as a professional. I'd recommend you use more than just the stock included OEM camera lens. I recommend zoom lenses and fish-eye lenses for this camera to create more eye-catching stunning photos. This camera is great for the beginner and intermediate, alike. But if you want to go bigger, do so. If you're a full-blown professional, more than likely, you'll buy a more expensive camera. The average price of this camera currently at the time of writing this review is $300. Professionals usually invest $900+ in their camera. But cost isn't everything. Each photographer must carefully consider a camera not just because its high price but consider image quality and other functionality.

BATTERY LIFE: 5/5
Battery life is impressive, to my standards. But as with anything, battery life always depends how much a device is used and what settings are used. Usually, I use this camera for weddings and receptions. I take an average of 300-500 photos per event day so using the camera from 1PM until about 11PM, I'm able to use this camera the entire event day without charging the factory OEM battery. (*Note: I usually do not use the flash for about 100 photos, as they are outdoor daylight photos. The rest of the photos are indoor photos.)

WHAT'S NOT SO GREAT: Small minor issue but I wish that DSLRs like these featured internal memory storage, instead of just relying on only external SD cards.",04-13-2015,04-13-2015

This camera is a steal. The quality in natural light is great, though more noise appears as you zoom in. The hood only fits on the 55-200mm lens (just so you know).

I've included a few photos I took at the park with both lenses. There was only a little post production, to lighten the images and fix the colors a tad. Overall, I'm pleased with my switch to Nikon.",03-21-2015,03-21-2015

I would recommend this camera to anyone that is thinking they might enjoy photography.  It does a great job on the automatic side, giving you more flexibility than a point and shoot, but if you want to learn how to shoot manually it does that very well.  It is a good place to start.

He LOVES it, and I've ""converted him to the Darkside.""  Even though his 40D is a good camera in its own right, the more modern technology, better out of camera color, and menu system of the Nikon D3200 have re-ignited his love of photography.  The D3200 is being phased out at the moment, resulting in great bargains for camera and lens kits.

With the capability to do both video and still photography, the D3200 is a great step for budding filmmakers and family photographers.  The quality of the images far surpasses what can be done with a cell phone camera, but at the cost of more weight and larger physical size.  The ability to change lenses to suit a particular situation is a huge plus, as well as the ability to control exposure.

The camera itself has a nice large screen on the back, a pop-up flash, and the ability to be used in all the camera modes you'd expect from full manual control to aperture or shutter automation to a program mode that turns the camera into a point and shoot machine.  A helpful guide feature in the menu system greatly assists inexperienced photographers, and the large screen on the back makes it easy to see camera settings (although I prefer a screen on the top panel, which this camera lacks).  You can shoot at up to 4 frames per second, which is as fast as expensive film cameras of the 1980's.

The drawbacks for this camera include its smaller size, which may not accomodate some large handed shooters; settings which can only be accessed via the menu instead of a dedicated button; and the fact that the newer D3300 offers improved performance and reduced size for about $100 more.

So, what to do with your hard-earned money?  As of this writing the D3200 is an incredible bargain, with features suitable for all levels of shooters from beginners to professionals.  Quite frankly, for someone who knows how to properly use a camera, you will only get better images from a more expensive camera in highly specialized situations (like virtually no light or where you might need 11 frames or more per second).  The feature set difference between the D3200 and D3300 is negligible, making the D3200 the better buy.  If you're in the market for a digital SLR and money is tight, look no futher:  The D3200 will re-ignite your passion for photography just like it did for my sister's boyfriend.  He's already bugging me for lens recommendations.",02-01-2015,02-01-2015

on non-flash and auto shoot mode. Each shot started to develop blury on day or night shots without the flash.
So I sent out for an exchange and they were pretty hassle free on the replacement. However, the replacement camera
right out of the package was a lemon too, it did not shoot properly shoot at all on any mode.
It kept displaying <Error. Press shutter release button again> which did absolutely nothing.
I had to do a master reset of the shooting mode and it worked properly for a few days.
And then again randomly did the same thing but this did not properly reset the shooting mode and still displayed the error.
I'm not sure if these refurbished or what, but for over $500 this is ridiculous. I'm not sure who to blame Nikon or Amazon.
Either way this is unacceptable.",01-21-2015,01-21-2015

That should be the review. A lot people don't know what an SLR is let alone a DSLR. A DSLR you are totally in control. The D3200 is so easy to use. The interface is so user friendly. It has a built-in guide to give you an idea about the shot you are trying to shoot. It also has an auto feature so you can use it as a point and shoot.  It has a manual mode to put you in total control. The D32 has no effects mode. But for the money not to mention this is a SLR not a point and shoot. So effects would be useless. Just read about what an SLR camera is. These type of camera does lot more than anyone can write on a review page. The 24 maga pixels are outstanding. This would make being your first SLR an excellent choice. This is not a professional grade camera, it is consumer grade. The kit lens isn't the best but it will get you started on photography and it will do intil you can upgrade to a better lens.

 the NON-VR lens. Was told to re-order again once it came back in stock !, I found it listed again but with the same issue as before , so I've returned this D3200 Model , and now I've decided to upgraded to a  higher Professional Nikon Model .
Unfortunately most of my photos came out very blurred , Dark and it was a hassle with the manual settings. I read all the positive reviews and this Model Nikon D3200 just didn't make the cut  for me on a  Professional or amateur (student) Level !

I've never owned a DSLR camera before - heck, my only camera for the past decade has been a cell phone.  She had dabbled in SLR film photography prior to this, though, and had a much better idea of what she was doing.

My first impression of this camera was more or less ""wow... I can actually take pictures in low light without a flash.""  The ability to actually capture what one sees naturally is a pretty huge deal.  This may seem pretty stupid to more experienced photographers, but it was a brave new world to me.

The instructions which come with the camera are very clear, and seem definitely written for someone who has never played with a ""real"" camera before.  There is not only a good explanation of the mechanical features of the camera (ie, which buttons do what) but also contain a decent crash course on manual photography.  They explain the basics -  aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and how each of the different settings configure these settings to produce a different quality of image.  Starting with zero background information, I was able to develop a decent intuition based on these descriptions and some trial and error (ie - just taking a lot of pictures).  Coming from a film background, my girlfriend had the same reaction - ""It's nice to just be able to practice with the camera, get instant feedback, and not have to worry about film.""

One of the complaints I've seen about this camera compared to the slightly more expensive models, is that the single thumb wheel is limiting, and slows down the photography workflow.  I sort of disagree - at least for a beginner.  First of all, the camera has a number of well placed modifier buttons - so if you set the camera to ""manual aperture"" mode, the thumb wheel will control the aperture by default and use the magic of DSP to set the shutter speed, exposure compensation and ISO.  However, if you need to override one of those settings, all you need to do is press the correct modifier button, and the thumb wheel will then control the corresponding setting until the modifier button is released.  It works the same way in full manual mode, except then it then turns off all the automatic compensation features as well.  I sort of like this mechanic, as each partial-manual mode provides a single dimension of control (for simplicity), but still allows the user to easily and quickly override the other settings if necessary, without turning the mode dial to a different position.  I think it is a great mechanic for beginners since it provides a clear and easy to understand distinction between the various shooting modes, while still providing quick access to the rest of the settings.  In that sense, I don't see it as a limitation, as much as I see it as a somewhat simpler way to learn the camera while also learning the finer points of photography.  However, if you are already an expert, and understand the ins and outs of the Nikon hardware and software, then I could see it being a bit frustrating.  I haven't had to play around inside the menus to control basic settings at all though, as some have suggested in other reviews.

In terms of build quality, what more can I say which has not already been covered?  You definitely are not sacrificing mechanical or ergonomic quality when buying this camera over some of the more expensive ones.  It feels solid, but light in the hand.  All the buttons have a nice, firm, satisfying snappiness to them with no softness or ambiguity, and they are all placed in a way which makes sense.  The action on the lenses feels like butter, and even though they are plastic - they feel sturdy and high quality.  From what I understand, one's ability to shoot at low shutter speeds and small aperture is directly related to one's ability to balance and control the weight of the entire kit, so the attention to weight reduction which Nikon has put into this body and the lenses should directly translate to better pictures.  Even the Nikon branded bag which comes with the bundle demonstrates an incredible attention to detail, as the interior is completely modular through clever use of velcro dividers, which allows the user to easily move and re-size the various compartments.

The photographs themselves are stunning.  It's really difficult to put the experience into words.  Just the ability to reliably capture and record what one sees opens a whole world of possibilities in terms of shooting.  It is liberating in a way.  Even if your goal is not to have your photographs published in National Geographic, and you just want to document your vacation for posterity, being able to do so simply and reliably makes casual photography much more enjoyable.

In conclusion - this is a great camera for a beginner, and has a ton of room to grow with the user.  Sure, there are better sensors out there, and more feature-rich cameras, but for someone who's primary interest is to learn the basics, take fantastic pictures, and develop the hobby beyond what is possible with a point-and-shoot camera, it really seems like this would be difficult to beat in terms of price, quality and performance.",11-24-2014,11-24-2014

This camera is considered an entry-level camera by most professionals and industry insiders, and its true.  But don't let that fool you.  This camera takes amazing shots on Auto.  With just a little bit more knowledge, you can produce truly memorable photos.

I used this to shoot a wedding (the first one I have ever shot).  I shot everything in Aperture mode, in the JPG format.  I recently switched to shooting raw.  I use Aperture for post-processing and the flexibility raw provides is great.  Now that Apple is not continuing development of Aperture, I am switching to Lightroom.

The included ""kit"" lens is ok.  It gets you going.  I recommend getting a prime lens if you are interested in crisp shots.  My favorite photography is portraiture, and the Nikon 50mm f/1.8G AF-S NIKKOR FX Lens has made a huge difference in my photos.  Because this camera is a DX camera (also called crop sensor), 50 mm is actually 75mm, which puts you close to the sweet spot for portraits.

I chose this over the D3300 because the D3300, while having a faster processor, did not have enough improvements to justify the extra cost.  I took the money I saved by buying this instead of the D3300, and purchased the 50mm lens.

(retired now)  Using a heavy 35 mm manual camera and miles of film.... This Nikon D3200 was my first choice for a digital SLR updated camera.  Being fairly  new to ""digital"" SLR. I caught on to the instructions  pretty fast since it's almost the same as it used to be on my old camera.  The concept and rules of photography didn't change....  I found that using this camera was pretty easy after going through the instruction book, plus trial and error, just taking photos with the camera.  This camera has all the features that I would use.... even has a photo editor in the menu... color enhancer, crop, red eye corrector,  change photo to black and white, even has a star filter add in... warming or cooling effect,  lots of added stuff.. I used to do in the darkroom with color prints, manually.

This camera comes with a lens 18 to 55 mm witch to me is a great small zoom lens, but it  wouldn't be my prime lens.  I would use a straight  35 mm for all around use, can use the lens in much lower light without a flash,  and the 18 to 55 mm for other things like family gatherings where you don't have to step around to get your shot,  just zoom in or out to make the frame fit the subject being photographed.

The camera has a pop up flash witch is real handy and easy to use, good for about ten to twelve feet.  Notice the flash is slightly higher then the lens.  You are more then likely going to get red eye pretty easy if the subject looks at the camera lens while being photographed ... The fix is having a TTL. external, dedicated  flash on the hot shoe that bounces off the ceiling ....much better results.

My research  home work paid off,  I believe ..... I was looking at the D3300  newer camera model,  and the specs. didn't change much, but the price went up for the newer model... so I saved about sixty bucks buying the older model camera.  The D3200 started new add on's after the D3100  like one I noticed,  would be the wireless controller remote shutter  ML-L3
Buying the VR lens was worth the extra money.  They do sell this without the VR lens.... for less $.  You need V R on your lens,  when you use any kind of zoom lens..... Keeps the vibration down for less blurring on slower shutter speeds or fast moving objects.  VR = Vibration Reducer

Overall This Nikon D3200 was my First choice for an all around SLR camera.....  Once you get your SLR camera in your hands, your pretty much will be commented to it.  Then it starts to be a collection of ""products to fit""  and add on to the camera.  Since you can do so much more being creative photography with this camera, over a point and shoot camera.  I gave this 5 Stars.",09-05-2014,09-05-2014

It basically allows anyone entry into the world of DSLRs for a fraction of what many good cameras cost. It has a large screen for easy use that you can turn off if you dislike it, and easy use buttons to cycle through light, flash, ISO, and so on. It clocks over 24 megapixels, which is quite a bit and allows you to play with image size. I like that it has a button I can hit to remind me of what settings I am currently using, allowing me modifications on the fly, and you can set it for a load of changes. The grip is not that bad, although this body style certainly does make for a different style of handling. In addition to the neck strap, I use a hand strap as well, mostly because I have long, skinny fingers.

For the beginner, there is a guide setting in addition to the auto features, allowing the user to easily set their camera for moving pictures, reduced blur, portraits, landscapes, and so on. There is an advanced guide setting as well, allowing a user to not only do something easily but to understand how this is accomplished. That is something I liked about this setting; oftentimes a person flips to a specific setting but does not understand how shutter speed or light allows that setting to work. You have an auto function as well, plus settings for portraits, no flash, landscapes, and so on. The manual modes also allow for different levels of control, allowing the user to manipulate shutter speed, aperture, program settings for ISO control, and manual mode for doing it all. Basically the camera caters to all levels, but it allows beginners to walk through everything.

The kit lenses in this set are pretty good, actually. People need to note that they do not have VR (vibration reduction) so you get shake. This is not such a big deal with pictures but taking good video will require the use of a tripod. The kit comes with an 18/55, great for doing landscapes at the lowest setting and good for doing portraits. It works as a carry lens, although the 18/55 is not my lens of choice by any means. The 55/200 allows you to get out further, giving you distance to take pictures of animals and people enjoying activities. The 55/200 does have a pretty good distance to it  you can photograph buzzards in flight, for example, although the VR does come into play with longer distance shots.

The bag is not bad, although I did encounter a few issues with it after time. The stitching on mine popped apart in places, which I did not like on something that essentially prices at around 40 USD if purchased separately. It has a zipper mesh pouch inside, a zipper pouch on the front, an area for storage on the back, and two side pockets. I like the zipper for things like my remote control (purchased because then 10 second timer on pictures is sometimes way too fast for me) and filters such as UV, macro (also purchased separately).

Note when you review this the body type and what that means, including what lens you can use. You need AF-S lens because of the type of camera, otherwise you end up with lens that only do manual focus jobs. You also should look up some videos taken with the camera because the D3200 picks up A LOT of background noise with the internal mike and it also picks up the sounds of the camera focusing. You might also want to look into getting a better flash for your camera depending on why you buy it; the kit lens with the camera flash will do well in normal light but indoor light will come up a little dark. You can buy external gear to remedy this for a good price, and you can buy lens to fit this that do all sorts of things like macro (I love taking pictures of insects), landscaping, portraiture (lenses with better aperture, basically), and so on. Nikon makes great cameras and really like the D3200. It makes taking pictures fun.",08-27-2014,08-27-2014

The camera itself and all accessories are perfect -- however, they are all much ""smarter"" than I am at this time. All I can say is that a NIKON DSLR has been on my wish list since I had to put my Pentax film SLR on the shelf years ago (nobody develops film  -- or even sells it  -- anymore in my area). I used (and still do use) my little NIKON Coolpix as an everyday camera, but yearned for the control that you can only get from a true SLR -- to experiment with exposures and so forth. So, I saved up to buy this baby. I am just in the baby steps of learning. I will probably be learning for a long time. The camera rather overwhelms me. However, I will learn and I will get as good as I used to be.  I am in 7th heaven.

If you are new and want a nice, inexpensive DSLR but are drowning/hesitating among all the options and prices, don't. Just buy this, you will not regret it. I picked up this refurb kit a month ago for $365, and I did a double take because I couldn't believe everything I was getting. I personally shoot with my trusty old&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D90/dp/B005MX9PCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D90</a>&nbsp;still, but this was for a specific project that needed a dedicated camera. I have to admit that this shoots way more reliably than my D90. It's focus is incredibly fast and the metering is Nikon perfect. It's amazing what half a decade in technology leads to both in quality and in price.

This D3200 bundle is the ideal camera for someone who is looking to step up from point-and-shoot cameras and phone snapshots and get started with digital photography. It is pretty full-featured and has amazing picture quality for a fraction of the cost of the more expensive models. Basically, this is a way to get into the hobby or dramatically improve the quality of your pictures without breaking the bank. I couldn't even tell that it was refurbished. It looked brand new to me. Not a scratch or a nick anywhere, and the LCD was bright and crystal clear. With this, you can produce stunning photos (and videos) without being reduced to tears if you drop it on accident or be too afraid to hand it to a friend/relative to take a picture for you. As is often said, having the best (read: most expensive) camera in the world is useless if you're too afraid to take it outside and take pictures.

The lens on this is a perfect first lens. It's 18-55mm, which means it's a zoom lens (you spin a ring on the lens to select the region you are capturing, zooming in one way and zooming out the other). It's sharp, fast, and handles low light decently. I'd of course recommend the spectacular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/fixed-35mm/dp/B001S2PPT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">fixed 35mm</a>&nbsp;for its tack sharpness and to shine in low-light as well as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/55-200mm/dp/B000O161X0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">55-200mm</a>&nbsp;to give you some telephoto (serious distance zoom) coverage, but these lenses each cost half the price of this camera kit! You can see how photography can become a very expensive hobby very quickly. I'd hold off on those as a first purchase and wait to see how things go.

But this is why this kit in particular is a great starter package. You get an entry level, but still very solid camera body and a decent zoom lens. Don't let the term ""entry level"" make you feel cheap, this is still a Nikon camera with a legitimate Nikkor lens. It is categorically different and more capable than any point and shoot or pinhole phone camera. Period. End of discussion. If you find that you want/need more, Nikon will be more than happy to sell you more lenses or step up to a more expensive camera body later. For the first step though, this is ideal.

I should note that in addition to taking ridiculously high quality photos, this also does quite well with video. It can do 1080p video at up to 30 fps or 720p at 60 fps. I'd have loved to have seen 1080p at 60fps, but you don't get that unless you go to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D3300/dp/B00HQ4W1QE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D3300</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D5300/dp/B00FXYT12G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D5300</a>&nbsp;which cost tons more than this D3200 kit. That's just not worth the extra cost.

In practice, I've been amazed. Even under terrible lighting conditions (e.g. indoor low light under coiled fluorescent lights with completely mismatched color temperatures and an LCD as an intended capture target) I can get remarkable photo and video quality with perfect color reproduction. Nikon's white balance settings do sheer magic where even a prosumer camcorder just fails miserably (I'm looking at you Sony). Sure, some of the knobs and dials are tucked away in menus and not as easily accessible as on the more pro-level cameras, but for the price, I'll deal with fiddling with the menus on the few times that I need them (honestly, my D90 was overwhelming for months when I first got it). For the vast majority of the time, I just set it to program or manual mode and fire away. It's beautiful.",07-03-2014,07-03-2014

I upgraded to a D7100, sold my D3100, and my husband decided he wanted a camera.  Purchased the D3200.  Would have preferred a color other than red, but it's a matter of appearance vs. function.  We purchased it on the back end of the lot, right after the D3300 came out, so color choices were a bit limited at the lower price point.

This is an improvement over the D3100, in terms of image resolution.  It takes great shots.  My husband is having great luck with it, right out of the box.  It probably helps that I know a bit about photography, so he's not forging new skills alone.

It's quite a bit smaller than my D7100, and lacks many of the features of the D7100, but for the entry level photographer?  Really can't go wrong.  Great, great camera.",07-01-2014,07-01-2014

It's my first DSLR or what I call ""real camera"". I went with the bundle because I didn't want to buy just the camera and 55m lens and have no bag. The bag is a nice size, light, durable zippers, and appears to be pretty durable. It comes with Velcro dividers so you can separate everything however you'd like. I haven't accumulated too much for mine yet. The bundle is well worth the extra $$$. The 55-200mm lens is valued around $200.00 by itself if purchase separately. I'm pretty impressed with the zoom on it as well. One thing I didn't like is that this bundle only comes with one lens hood (I bought a second on here for $3.00). Now on to functionality... I began shooting in ""auto"" mode, which is recommended to get a real feel for the camera. The AFS (autofocus) is a great feature for new photographers as well. Luckily both lenses are AFS in this bundle. The fact that this body allows 24.2 megapixels is insane. I can take a photo with little zoom, crop it, blow it up, and have very little to no blur whatsoever. I have taken several photos, from car shows, to concerts, to NHRA races and they have all turned out great. I'm not a big fan of the Nikon software that comes with the camera. I would recommend Picasa as a free download for editing and affects. There are a lot of features on this camera that would definitely need some studying to figure out when/how to apply correctly. I'd brush up on some basic DSLR info on Google so you will understand focus/shutter speed differences. I wish the wireless connector for this camera wasn't so expensive either ($60 range). A wireless remote can be picked up for less than $10 and I have found a 50"" tripod I plan to purchase here soon for $9.99. Overall, I REALLY like this camera and don't have any dislikes at this point. Maybe someone with more experience would disagree, but for now, I am thoroughly impressed and would recommend this camera to anyone.",06-29-2014,06-29-2014

This really is my only complaint with this camera; beyond that it handles easily (my hands are, I suppose, average size), the flash is bright, and if you, like me, want a camera capable of taking great images without a terribly high price tag, my experience says that this is better than its competitors.  The lens is also a winner, creating consistently sharp images at all zooms and apertures.  True, even wide open at 3.5 the amount of light available makes indoor handheld photography a tad challenging, but with a little practice the settings can be reached which make it possible to achieve stunning results.

PROS:
-Price. $500 is cheap in comparison to other similar (albeit lower quality) cameras, like the Canon Rebel T3i, 60D, or even the newer T5i.

-Build Quality. This camera is built in Thailand to the extent of my knowledge but the quality control on mine is absolutely incredible. Doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Has nice grips and a comfortable weight to it. Not an overly bulky camera either.

-Image quality/sensor. At $500, you get a true 24.2 megapixel DSLR camera. SnapSort in their comparison of the D3200 vs its direct competitor, the Canon Rebel T3i 18 megapixel DSLR, stated that the image quality on the D3200 is over 20% better as attributed to the D3200's 10% larger image sensor and higher true megapixel count, which accounts for 30% more detail in photos. The image sensor is very high quality and this camera consistently takes incredible pictures. I'm not a professional photography by any means, this is simply a great hobby of mine, but I am a perfectionist about pictures. The ability to easily take awesome pictures with this camera is second to none.

-Ease of use. I am an amateur photographer who was looking for a nice upgrade and I made sure to do my homework when it came to selecting a camera. I ended up on this camera because of what everybody else said, it's ease of use was a major selling factor in the purchase. I've had this camera for a few weeks and I still haven't even figured out everything it's capable of-- there's quite a bit! But the guide mode helps you with some basic and advanced photography.

-Nice lens kit. Out of the box I'll admit the 18-55mm is quite limited in what it can do, especially as somebody who enjoys macrophotography, but it'll be able to do most of the shots you'd like to take. The VR feature is nice as well.

-Nikon brand quality. As always, Nikon has delivered a high quality product. I've owned a few Nikon products before and they've never failed me. I prefer Nikons to Canons in the world of DSLRs anyway.

-Ability to save as JPG/Raw.

-Out of the box: comes with body, lens, strap, battery and charger, etc.

CONS:

It really is a glorified point and shoot. If you want it to shine get some really good lens.  Reality is lens make the camera more than camera makes the lens. Good lens will cost about or more than the cost of the 3200. My advice if you hate changing lens is to get this then the 18-300 macro zoom. Yes it is heavy but you will not have to carry four or five lens like I do.  That lens is a decent all around but not a good anything. Also get either a GOOD monopod or tripod. I have one of each but use the monopod more than the tripod. Remember their is a limit to what you can carry and you will miss a lot of great pics changing lens, putting on a tripod etc. The VR is terribly over rated. Take every photography course you can, learn you camera and how to set up your pic.  BTW Canon makes a camera that is similar. And cannon, usually has better lens though pricy.

By non-professional hobbyist I mean those for whom photography is not their means of income, but who cannot remain without a camera. I belong to that category.

The pictures, as is expected from Nikon DSLRs, are exceptional clear. If clarity is your concern, here is the camera for you. However, if zoom is your concern, you will have to buy zoom lenses because the standard lens (18-55mm) gives you a maximum of 4x equivalent optical zoom. Zoom lenses can be expensive and you should be ready to spend at least half of what you pay for the camera for your first zoom lens, with progressively more for longer focal lengths (= greater zoom values).

In fact, I'm just barely getting into it and I have to say, the money I spend on the Nikon D3200 is well worth it! The camera is very easy to use and has great manual features. Camera feels solid while holding it in the hands and doesn't feel cheap. Most of my family has Canon DSLR's and I was going to go with Canon, but took the risk and got this Nikon camera instead. It has not disappointed whatsoever. The images come out unbelievably crisp. It's not the megapixels that count, but rather how you shoot with the camera and the techniques. Of course, having 24MP's are great as pictures come out razor sharp.

For those that just want to point and shoot out of the box, you can with the D3200 with the guide mode. Makes taking quick photographs easy and you learn to dive into the camera at the same time. The shutter seems fairly quiet when taking shots. Buttons are well placed and adequately labeled. Wish it had a touch screen for quicker selection and settings, but thats being nitpicky. Getting to the setting is quite easy and fast.

First let me Say glad to be back to Nikon!. Buy this camera! I had trouble with my Olympus indoors in low light. This camera does the low light flash flawless. I am impressed at ease of controls and menus are much easier and straight forward. I went on a photography outing to Some ice castles that were lighted with LED's inside the ice and I tried Portrait in low light setting which worked fabulous lighting my wifes face in the low light and not washing out the ice sculpture lighting. I tried Auto shutting the flash off in the dark with the LED ice lights the only lighting and I was excited and amazed when I got home to view them at home on the computer!! They came out excellent. This is with the standard zoom kit lens. I didn't take as much pictures with the Olympus because of limitations in low light and confusing menus. Even the digital screen iseasy to understand what setting your in and how to get where you want to go. No going away from Nikon for me anymore!!

I fished it out of about 2 inches of water.  I tried everything to dry it, but it was history!

I am a professional, but no longer as a business, so I cannot see spending the thousands of dollars on a camera that I have to be so very careful about traveling with me everywhere because of the liability.  Still wanted a great camera that would be easy to take with me everywhere and is fairly easy to use, but also gives me control over how I want my photos to look.

I searched high and low, comparing many options, scouring Consumer Reports, checking out many online blog reviews, etc.  Finally I decided on this model for two reasons.  One, my favorite film camera is my Nikon and I have the AF lenses and flash that go with it and this model has a hotshoe for an external unit.  Two, I still like the viewfinder on my cameras!  Sometimes the sun or light glare prohibits using the screen.

Even great for someone who isn't a professional.  I wouldn't recommend it for a beginner or a point and shooter because the controls can be a bit confusing to someone who has no knowledge of photography or the how and why for each of the settings.  I didn't give it a full 5 stars because sometimes it takes too long to start up when I power it on.  It's a little technical when you want to switch from the viewfinder and the screen....can't just change in quick second; you might lose your shot!

It can be set up as a point and shoot camera or set up to give very professional looking pictures. So many whistles and bells. It is not overwhelming to operate. There are menus that give suggestions for shooting different scenes and setting of the aperture and shutter speed and focus to produce really professional looking high quality pictures. And the SLR feature allows you to purchase different lenses for different applications. Really nice sturdy feel to this camera system.,01-29-2014,01-29-2014

For my price range, it came down to the D5100 and the D3200.  I believe the D5100 had a few more advanced features but the flip-out screen just seemed like an accident waiting to happen.  I tend to crop my photos so the extra MP should help.

  After spending 2 months with this camera I absolutely love it and know I made the right decision.  The photos rival DSLRs 2x the price.  I have not read much bad press about this camera and for good reason.  Buy the camera body then go out and buy the best glass you can afford.  I matched mine with the new 18-140mm and 35mm prime.

  Cons:  Body is a little small for my larger hands
  ISO in increments of 100 with 100 being the lowest
  No in camera panorama
  No multi-exposure bracketing

  Pros:  Image Sensor
  Shutter Speed
  In Camera HDR
  Button Layout

There are a few more pros and cons but for the money, you can not beat this camera.  Overall a better value than the D5100 and quite possibly the D5200 IMO.",01-24-2014,01-24-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-Digital-18-55mm-3-5-5-6-Focus-S/dp/B007VGGFZU?th=1,35,Electronics,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Auto Focus-S DX VR NIKKOR Zoom Lens (Black) (OLD MODEL),4.6,4,Excellent camera with a couple of drawbacks,"I bought this camera over a year ago to replace my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-HMX-R10/dp/B001P3OT1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung HMX-R10</a>&nbsp;and it works brilliantly as a movie-making camera and as a still camera. Naturally, as there is a focus ring the D3200 is not focused to infinity so when you're lining up your shots, be it video or stills, you will need to take a bit of extra time. This wouldn't be such a hassle if there was a pop-out reversible screen (as featured on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nikon-D5100-model/dp/B004U4UHTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nikon D5100 model</a>) but there isn't, which means if you are out shooting on your own and want yourself to be in the shot then you are going to run into many logistical problems. Quite annoying, but it's my only real gripe with this model. There IS auto-focus, naturally, but you can't be sure that you're actually in the shot and in position without a reversible screen.

The quality of the pics, at 24.2 megapixels, is amazing, with very deep colors and bold contrast. When loaded onto your computer you can zoom-in many times without losing resolution. It's great. There are a few picture editing tools but I've never really experimented with them as I prefer my shots to look as natural as possible. The long-exposure feature is capable of creating night shots with amazing light effects.

The video can record in 24fps, which is a major plus if you want your movies to look as film-ic as possible. Obviously setting it to 1080p is the best option. I wish that it shot in 2k but simple 1080p is all that it offers. Still, the quality of the video image is excellent, and a huge improvement on simple camcorders.

There is an audio-in jack for attaching externals mics, and a shoe on the top for securing it (or an auxiliary flash), but when taking pics the built-in flash will not fire properly with a mic loaded.

The strap is a bit of a gamble. Twice now the clasps have given way when I've been carrying it around my shoulder. Luckily, I was quick enough to catch the camera in my hand, but it's just too heavy. I'd recommend using vinyl tape or staples to bind the cord and ensure that it does not come undone.

The 18-55mm lens is pretty basic, and you will have to stand very close to anything that you want to shoot, but it works perfectly with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/52mm-Wide-Angle-Lens/dp/B003VNB9U8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">52mm Wide-Angle Lens</a>&nbsp;if you want a mini-IMAX feel to your shots, and can also be used with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AG-LA7200-Anamorphic-Lens/dp/B0023U0X5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AG-LA7200 Anamorphic Lens</a>&nbsp;to frame your movies in full 2.35:1 widescreen. The stills have a native aspect ratio of 1.55:1 and will come out in 2:1 with an anamorphic attachment that has a 1.33:1 squeeze.

The camera uses SCHD memory cards that are loaded into a little slot on the right of casing, but the door that closes over this slot feels a little flimsy. It's never once broken on me, but it's one of those things that once broken can never be repaired which means that a new camera is on the cards if it does snap off.

A very good camera, despite the drawbacks I have listed, I'd recommend this camera to newbs and novices as it is very easy to get familiar with. I love the red color and can stop polishing it whenever I get it out. I don't want any marks or fingerprints. Just keep an eye on the strap.",01-19-2014,01-19-2014

However, I also bought the dummy's book for the D3200 and that helped immensely! This thing is fantastic and once you get the hang of it, after a day with the camera and the book, it is very simple to use. The continuous shoot is a blast. We took over 130 photos of the kids in just 5 sled runs down a small hill in our yard - so many goods ones and the action and image is extremely crisp.

I wanted a little more zoom for capturing wildlife too, and though the lens that came with it just wasn't powerful enough for those types of close-ups, so I ended up ordering the Nikon 55-300mm lens kit also which is just what I was looking for. However, don't just buy the Nikon 55-300mm lens, that was $400 on Amazon, but the whole kit (also on Amazon) with a bunch of other additions was $100 less! It made no sense, but I'm glad I found it.

It was a little intimidating when I first got it a year ago and I put it away for almost 8 months, preferring my Pentax point and shoot, because there were fewer settings.  I took this one out of the back pack again in November and determined to learn how to use it.

It takes fantastic low light shots and it gives great product shots for my website using the product tent with full spectrum CFBs.  I'm a total noobie with Digital SLR, even though I used to take photos with a Pentax K1000 and develop my own film.  Digital SLR is nothing like the old Pentax.

I also use this camera to take landscape shots and live animal shots.  It does a really good job with both.  Some of my landscape shots look like paintings, the focus is so crisp, and the light play with the camera is really attractive.  It has a fast shutter speed for action shots and to catch moving animal shots, like seals leaping to grab a herring out of your hand.  I haven't mastered the grandchild shots yet, though.

The pictures are 6 to 8 mb in size and give lots of room for editing using the built in editing tools.  The video is good and the built in microphone is better than the one in my Flip video camera (which stopped working this Fall).

The camera has a learning curve.  I'm not going to outgrow this camera for a long time.  I'd recommend getting one of the camera guides to shorten your learning time, if you've never used an SLR digital camera before.

I still haven't learned how to fully utilize all the bells and whistles, but now I'm determined to learn.

Buy a sturdy tripod for it.  I got an aluminum tripod and the wind blew it over in the first 5 minutes of trying to shoot a video with it.

The red colour is the best.  It was the reason I decided on this camera over the alternatives.  And after a year, I still love it.",12-25-2013,12-25-2013

In addition to the megapixels, it had a few more improvements over the D3100, and I decided I was willing to shell out the extra dollars for the improvements.  I've only had my camera for a month.  I have no prior experience or knowledge with things like aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  I'm slowly learning through research and playing with the camera.  I had read this camera was great for beginners, because the LCD screen is very visual as you are making changes.  For example, when changing the aperture, there is a circular image that gets smaller and wider showing what you are doing, etc.  The product came with the standard 18-55mm lens as described.  I haven't really used the lens much as I purchased an additional lens when I purchased the camera.  I've read the lens is a good beginner lens.  As you learn more about how to use the camera, you'll eventually desire other lenses.  The camera comes with the rechargeable battery and charger, a camera strap that says NIKON and a lens cover.  There is as small built in flash that you manually turn on and off. If you are new, take the time to read the instruction manual and then get on the internet and read, read, read.  It might seem very overwhelming at first as you hear terms and numbers that you don't even kind of understand, but once the basics click you'll open up a whole new world.

I must say that the D3200 well exceeded all my expectations for spending about $550 on the body as well as the kit lens. However, I will update this review over the life of the camera, so you can get an accurate review to make an informed decision.

Let's begin...

So far, the camera on auto is great, but it's true beauty lies when the user tries to mess around with the manual settings. I've been able to achieve some fantastic photo effects by changing the features from the shutter speed to the ISO settings.

Based on my pictures (and one video) thus far, I can definitely say the following:

1. Auto Mode is okay. Honestly though, if all the you want to do with a camera is take pictures on auto., then purchase a cheaper digital camera since you won't be utilizing the D3200's full potential... or any DSLR for that matter.

2. The 18-55mm kit lens takes great pictures, but its certainly not professional quality; Let alone designed for professionals. I fully intend to learn the camera and master it's settings before committing to a more expensive (professional quality) lens, which can amount to quite an expensive sum.

3. The video visual was amazing, but the video audio was not. The camera does have a external mic input, which I intend to take full advantage of. TIP: Make sure to purchase a class 6 memory card or higher or the video may turn out ""laggish."" I purchased a class 10.

4. The 24.2 Megapixels was great if I wanted to crop without ruining the quality of the photo, otherwise it didn't make much (if any) difference when compared to 12ish megapixel photos.

To sum up my experience, the D3200 is a great camera for beginners. I would even say the it's well suited for moderate level photographers if the camera isn't used on auto. mode. If anyone believes that they aren't getting great pictures, then I would say that the problem is most likely the photographer... not the camera itself. The camera truly does take fantastic pictures, yet it's less likely to happen on auto... and forget about professional quality with this 18-55mm lens. To truly take great pictures with this camera, you'll go far by going out one day to take a ton of pictures on various manual settings... then see for yourself what the effects are.",12-07-2013,12-07-2013
https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-Digital-18-55mm-3-5-5-6-Focus-S/dp/B007VGGFZU?th=1,35,Electronics,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Auto Focus-S DX VR NIKKOR Zoom Lens (Black) (OLD MODEL),4.6,4,A Very Good Easy To Use Tool For Taking Very Good Pictures,"I have been an avid amateur photographer since I was young.  For many years I used various 35mm cameras and one medium format one that take film.  I took thousands of slides and pictures.  When digital started with Sony floppy disk cameras I bought one.  I used the digital cameras with my work in heavy machines.  I graduated to more Sony digitals.  I always had high end phones, and those started having better and better digital cameras.  I never got rid of my favorite film cameras.  These include a 1953 Voightlander Prominent, Olympus OM2n, Olympus XA, Olympus Stylus.  I learned to edit pictures early on using Photoshop.  I have used Picasa since introduced.  I really like Picasa as it is OK for the thousands of pictures of machines I need to quickly edit and add to web sites.  Recently I have started using iPhoto.  iPhoto IMHO is much more capable than Picasa.

I stopped using film a few years back and have started back using film in the last two years.  I started to try and get better pictures with my digital compact and phone cameras.  Those work well with scenery pictures at a mid level of quality, but were hopeless taking pictures of pets or children or any action.  When I saw the Olympus OMD in chrome I immediately wanted one of those.  Looked my my 1980 Olympus OM2n which I have always thought was just about a perfect camera and beautiful.  Mine works perfectly after 33 years BTW.  So I did months of research on the OMD and then tried to see and hold one in person.  There is only one Olympus dealer in San Diego and they kept selling out of them.  Once I got to see a black OMD but no chrome.  Then Oly started the on again off again sales.  I was pressured by going on a long trip last summer so I wanted to get a new DSLR.  This was complicated by the fact that Olympus is a smaller sensor format that not everyone likes.  No actual live viewfinder.  And it costs a lot more than Nikon 3200.

The other camera I considered extensively was the Sony Nex 6.  In the past I had only bought Sony digitals and consider them a superior product.  The Nex 6 was less money than the Olympus OMD.  What turned me towards the Nikon was recommendations.  On line recommenders like Nikons.  The Sony early last summer had a limited selection of lenses like the ones I wanted.  Olympus had want I wanted, but I never could hold one in my hands and it was twice the price of the Nikon 3200.  I drove several times to the local camera store to see the Olympus, but no luck.

So I ordered the Nikon and two additional lens from Amazon.  As usual Amazon delivered everything fast and in perfect condition.  The Nikon has worked flawlessly from day 1.  The 3200 is fairly easy to learn.  The adjustments and controls take a little time to get used to but are relatively easy.  It takes very good digital pictures without much effort.  Those who just want to take pictures that are pretty good should just take the standard 18-55mm lens with image stabilization and leave it at that.  It works fine for pictures blown up on my 27"" computer monitor.  The only annoying thing is that with a lens as slow as this one the built in flash is always popping up.  Even in shots that don't need a flash.  So I find myself setting the camera flash off frequently.  I have not used the two additional lenses I bought much.  The longer lens a few times for distant scenery.  I thought I would use the much faster 35mm lens all the time.  So far that is not the case.  Before I bought it I did not notice that the 35mm lens did not have image stabilization.  When I have used it that has not been an issue.  I come from many cameras that did not have IS and always instinctively hold my breath and stay still when shooting.

The Nikon is much larger than my Olympus OM2.  I would prefer the OM2 size.  But I find the 3200 very comfortable in my hands.  Yes it is big, but the size and weight works well.  It is a plastic camera.  It is well made but very plastic.  Much more so than my last Sony compact camera.  The Sony has a much more pleasing quality look to it.  The comparison between the Voightlander or OM2 in quality appearance and feel is vast.  In the distant past I owned a Nikon FM SLR and can attest that Nikon knows how to make a very high quality look and feel camera.  The Nikon is not cheap plastic feeling, but rubberized sorta cheap plastic feeling.  If you really like Apple products like Mac Books, iPhones, iPads you may not like this product.  It is in no way a jewell like thing of beauty like Apple products.

But it takes very good pictures easily.  It focuses fairly quickly and comes up with very good color balanced shots on automatic.  It has a small view finder.  Much much much smaller and less useful than my 33 year old Olympus.  For me the viewfinder size and lack of light is the worst feature.

I have most of my film cameras on display in a glass cabinet in my office.  The Voightlander is a thing of beauty.  It still works well after 60 years.  The last time it was cleaned and worked on was 1979.  It is hard to use.  Mostly because of it's small and dull view finder.  Maybe some day I will buy a Leica M3 for the finder.  The metal working and gorgeous glass lenses on the Voightlander put a smile on my face just holding it in my eye or hand.  The Olympus OM2n is only slightly less so.  The metal on the Oly is not as nice but the Olympus easy operation makes up for it.  Both the Voightlander and the Olympus are about the same size.  The Nikon 3200 as a tool to take pictures is a good camera.  The shots I have taken with it at the highest settings on the sharpest (35mm) lens are very good.  They are not as good as shots taken with my OM2 and it's 50mm lens with good film in color or detail.  However, the Nikon is much easier to use and get good shots with.  But I feel absolutely no passion for the 3200 and good photography demands passion.",12-07-2013,12-07-2013

Was a little disapointed in higher iso's but it gets the job done I am a web designer and got it because I was sick of begging for content now I just stop in take a couple hundred of high quality pics charge them and get to work. As a side note if it wasn't for the sub par camera on the nexus phones I never would have gotten this. Also buy the prime 1.8 35mm lens it makes a world of difference and was only $200 more.

However, this camera really doesn't have any standout features.  Its the same old technology that has been around for years.  You are still going to have to wait a ton of time between shots, the burst mode is slow, and the burst mode does not support focusing between shots.  The view finder is not going to actually show you the picture you are going to get since it is an optical viewfinder.  And the viewfinder is going to black out when you actually take the shot.  Sure, all these traditional SLR cameras take great pictures, but really, what camera at this price doesn't.  What are you really looking for at this price point?  For me, it is fast between shots and can burst fast so I am sure to get a great shot.  I hate cameras that make me wait between shots until the camera is ready to take another picture.
If you want the hidden gem in the SLR camera world, check out the Sony SLT technology.  It is a new technology that is much faster and allows the viewfinder and focus mechanisms to function like they should.  I have the SLT-A57 and I think you can tell from the reviews that it is as good or better than any of these SLR cameras.
No, I don't work for Sony.  I just think that someone should point out the fact that there are other options out there and better technology available.",11-25-2013,11-25-2013

Forty years ago, this was Nikon's top-of-the-line camera.

 Between my F2 and this D3200, I have a variety of much-lesser film and digital cameras.

 I've long wished there was a digital back available for my F2, to convert it into a DSLR. The advantages of digital photography over stone-aged film photography are tremendous, but nothing else that I had before the D3200 could take pictures nearly as good as what I could get with my F2.

 This D3200 takes great pictures, easily in the same league as my old F2.

 This is actually Nikon's current bottom-of-the-line (they prefer the term entry-level) DSLR, though quite a stock still seems to be out there, being sold in stores, of the now-obsolete predecessor to this camera, the D3100. The experience of using it sure doesn't feel like what you expect of bottom-of-the-line. It certainly does not feel like a step down in any way from my F2.

 This camera seems to do an amazing job of striking a balance between the needs of the rankest novice, and those of the most experienced, discerning professional or skilled amateur. It has fully-automated modes that implement an amazing degree of intelligence in determining the nature of the scene before it, and picking the optimal settings to photograph that scene,and it has fully-manual modes that allow the photographer to exercise complete control over every parameter.

 Although the manual claims that non-AI lenses (any F-mount lenses made before 1977) cannot be used with this camera, I have found that all of my old non-AI lenses that I have for my F2 work just fine on this camera, albeit with some obvious and expected limitations.",11-15-2013,11-15-2013

Many of the frames were different exposure situations to test the metering system.  Shooting digital is similar to shooting slide film, i.e., an under exposed frame contains more information than an over exposed frame and by default this camera under exposes.  Every frame needs a little PhotoShop work to make it look its best.  The lens is not very sharp, but, that has always been the case with zoom lenses.  The lens does not do justice to the 24.2 MP sensor.
I see the D3200 often described as an entry level DSLR and I agree with that summary.  The camera is adequate for my applications and I am satisfied with it.",11-01-2013,11-01-2013

I decided to go with Nikon because some online information suggests that Nikon lens can produce pictures with ""more color"" than comparable Cannon counterparts.  However, after used this camera for sometime, I found it response quite slow. In some cases, not much better than my digital card camera.  The pic quality is okay, not impressive at all.

I am new to DSLR but have used Nikon D40 before. So this review is for novice. D3200 is a light weight, small camera that packs many features. I use it for my kids primarily. The picture quality is very crisp and clear. The 24mp thing doesn't make much difference to naked eyes, but sure is nice when you need to blow up the pictures to print. We had some portraits done by a photo studio and some pictures look blurry at 12x12. Even with my cheap inkjet printer at home, there's a difference when I print pictures from various sources.

I noticed after a few days that I don't like the color saturation of the pictures. The colors don't ""pop"". Found out online that D3200 does not saturate the colors as much as other DSLRs in its standard mode. If you like more vivid colors, you have to adjust the image quality under Shooting Menu in one of the manual modes. I cranked up the contrast and saturation in Vivid mode and the colors came out a lot better. Some reviews complain about its tendency to overexpose, I wonder if that's what they're talking about. Kids don't look very good if they look pale.

I also noticed that it performs more like a point-n-shoot camera under indoor low light while using one of the preprogramed settings. The light compensating bulb in the front is very, very bright. As I'm getting more comfortable with the various settings, I find myself moving toward the P, A, S modes. I haven't had time to use it on landscape. I look forward to using it during our trips this fall. I haven't used the video function either. Looks a bit too complicated for me. I've got a point-n-shoot camera for that.",09-12-2013,09-12-2013

I'm selling my D40 on eBay this week... With the addition if WiFi and 1080p video, this camera now has everything I could ask in an quality vacation accessory. The only concern I have is the thickness of the camera body. It seems they used a lighter  and thinner plastic that my D40. That makes it lighter, but it also make it feel a little cheap... But it's not a cheap camera.  The features and functions are all well thought out and there's probably little a novice could ask for.  Have not used the wifi yet but I read there is a learning curve and mobile phone software needed. The kit comes with a great bag and the only thing about the bag I don't like are the ""clinky"" sounding snap connectors that keep it closed. The additional lens is NIKKOR.

The camera body w/ lens is very light compared the film ancestors. Controls are logically placed. It offers a variety of options for the serious as well as point-n-shoot amateurs.

Menu settings are easy to follow though the accompanying guide was not very  elaborate. You need to download more detailed reference manual from the Nikon USA site for more detailed help.

The camera has manual(M), aperture priority(A), shutter priority(S), program(P), auto with and without flash and various scene modes. All the non-auto modes work great and offer you a lot of flexibility. I did not use the auto or preset scenes modes I found most of what I needed in the other modes.

The auto-focus has a variety of options to suit various situations & scenarios (all the way from single point focus to wider area for focus. However I found the exposure metering options to be somewhat limited. The AF-L/AE-L button allows you to lock auto-focus and auto-exposure as you pan the camera. and it is useful when you want to focus on the subject on the side of the frame.

The wireless adapter is a useful addition to the camera as it lets you take pictures on the camera remotely or download or view pictures from an Android phone.

It was a jump from 35, but the D3200 is fantastic. I'm getting great details and vibrant colors after just a little time shooting. The images are clear and crisp from 100 to 3200 ISO/ASA with slightly noticeable noise around 6400.
One thing to note is that, if you don't know how to completely utilize the camera, the images will be bad, or underwhelming. I recommend trying to familiarize yourself with some of the slightly more advanced features. After using a completely manual 35 I had no problem diving into some of these features and they helped a lot. Try to stay away from the auto features and go into shutter priority, aperture priority, and manual shutter modes.
The image effects are present, but I wouldn't say any of them are particularly impressive. Yes you can give your image a sort of older appearance, but if that's the kind of shooting you go for regularly, I would recommend just using an old camera and some expired film.
I would recommend this camera to most people who are looking at entering the DSLR market. I take that back. If you'rte looking to get into DSLR, this is a great choice. One note, just because the MP is twice some other cameras, doesn't mean the pictures are twice as good right away. You need to get comfortable with changing settings you normally would just leave alone.

simple ease of use and Nikon has always been my favorite. I grew up shooting 35mm and taking this to the 35mmDSLR this was the best transition camera for me. Hind sight tells me I should have looked at a few other features but this is a bargain at this price.
I think I would however opt for just the camera body and buy a lens with a better F stop. 1.8 or at least a 2.8 allowing for better night time photography. Night life, restaurants or stars in the sky.

But after this D3200 I realize that there are 2 worlds, and the image from this camera is way better than every expensive top edge compact cameras arround
So if you like photograph and like me have small kids, go for it and buy one dlsr, so you use it in childrens parties, in home and in places were you can take it ( its very big and anoying to carry but worth it in some cases)
In places where you cannot use it, because its big, use some regular compact high iso camera (I suggest the 3D W3 fuji for sunny places, as a thrird camera)
The wireless is nice. Somewhat slow to connect, but works nicely in my android phone and is funny to show to friends in parties
Well built camera, feels strong, and after all, I cant believe it costs so few, because of what it is
And better of all, you can just point and shoot, and never have to read its mannual if you don't want to...
Going now to buy one flash, by nikon mostly because of the brand printed in it
The only downside is that this camera was that it uses only original nikon bateries ($ 70 each), as D7000 can use regular chinese inexpensive batteries

While I miss some of the dedicated buttons, bracketing, and the availability of a true battery grip (the ones that exist require a short cable between the port and the grip, making ergonomics lousy) I do NOT miss the weight of my previous cameras.

Picture quality is outstanding and even the little 18-55 turned out so great I left it on most of the time during a four week trip.
Using superb f2.8 lenses I had outstanding results at concerts, church services, indoors and outside.

I'm especially happy that the HDMI output allows a clean feed to my Blackmagic Intensity Extreme and my Macbook Thunderbolt for video capture. And if you're just filming to card you now have more options and 20 minute runtime. Battery life is good but only half of the D300/D7000.

It has multiple screen viewers and multi targeting in 3D. I am still learning all the features but was able to use it in 5 mins. Files are really compressed in JPEG FINE.
I use for people and landscapes. for real crisp photo's and on enlargements and blowups-no resolution loss. Sometimes seems clearer. I use corel photo ,free photoscape (good program for free).I bought 5 crappy digi cameras till I bought this one. I should have never wasted my money.

First of all, this camera great for me cuz I'm regular user not a professional photographer, and it exactly what I need. Easy to use, many functions with explanation, and even there is Guide Mode where u can learn how use different mods. Was so happy with this camera with it 18-55 standard lens, so bough additional one lens 55-300mm VR. So now with 24pixels I'm able take great shots in short and long distance.

That being said if you get the exposure right when you take the photo the D3200 outshines the T3i in sharpness and color depth!  And cropped photos turn out better due to the added megapixels! If I didn't own both of these and had to choose one I probably would pick the Canon because I take a lot of low light photos, however they are both very nice cameras and the Nikon has integrated guide mode to help beginners take good photo!

I decided it was time to upgrade to a newer camera and had heard some good things about Nikon. I found the D3200 and bought a bundle at a local warehouse store that included two lenses. I spent quite a bit of time with the camera and found that the photos actually turned out quite nicely. The auto focus was fast and the camera was pretty quiet. If you are new to DSLRs or are used to Nikon then I am sure you would be happy with this camera.

For someone who is used to working on a Canon, this probably is a camera you would want to stay away from. I found the menu to be clunky. The settings weren't very easy to change in manual mode. I ended up with pushing far more buttons to change settings such as the ISO than I do with my Canon. The shutter/aperture wheel was a lot more awkward to reach with my thumb than with my index finger as I am used to with my Canon.

There is a lot to learn. You can use a wireless remote for shutter release (optional) it has a built in flash and a hot shoe. The red enamel is very  nicely done, I usually am a black fan on camera's -but something about this one drew me. You need a SD card, I went with a 16GB which will do a thousand pictures at high resolution. I also bought a macro-zoom lens, took a picture of one of our cats and zoomed the image using the button on the back -to the point where the entire lcd showed just a green eye-and it wasn't taken as a close up-the whole cat was in  the image taken. I imagine the capability to zoom and crop with 24 megapixels will afford the capability to make pic's that were a little off, quite usable.

The D3200 fits the bill nicely.  The D3200 is a ""starter"" DSLR that is loaded with features. For the nearly newbie, the guide mode will help take some of the mystery out of a camera with more buttons, dials and settings than the typical point and shoot.

The D3200 has several automatic settings for the typical shooting situations that will set the likely settings needed for the shot.  This will allow those of you who want a nice camera's quality without spending too much time learning speed, aperture, f-stops and the like.  Switch selectable modes include night portrait, portrait, landscapes, kids, sports and macro. The experienced photographer can configure the camera with full manual settings, shutter priority, aperture priority and the like.

I find the D3200 fits nicely in my hand and makes it easy to position for the shot.  I like having the eyepiece for the viewfinder as I'm often shooting outside. LCD displays are often overpowered by the ambient light which for me is the reason to consider this camera over some of the similarly priced compact cameras. Being bigger than a point an shoot, means you'll need to plan on taking it along instead of just keeping it in a pocket, however.",02-02-2013,02-02-2013

I figured having a camera and video camera in one would make it easier to take video of our kids, especially #3 who was sorely lacking in the video department compared to the first two. I was debating between the D5100 and the D3200. (The D5200 was just announced when I made the purchase and had forced the price of the D5100 down to about the same as the D3200). In the end, I decided the only thing I liked on the D5100 that wasn't on the D3200 was the swivel screen. And I figured the newer, higher megapixel sensor would make this one last longer before it was replaced with a newer model. Pretty soon the D5100 wasn't being sold by Amazon, so that sealed it since buying from Amazon would get me a free SD card, backpack, $100 off the 55-200 VR lens (also an upgrade from my non-VR 55-200) and 2% back plus downgrading from Prime shipping even netted me $3 to spend on Amazon Instant Video.

Since getting it, I have loved it. I'd describe myself as an ""advanced"" novice photographer. The Guide option has been really helpful to get at some of the settings on the camera. Decided to go with the red body, and I kind of miss the texture of the black body, as the red is more smooth and ""plasticy"" feeling. But so far the red does make it stand out and easy to tell which one is mine among the crowd.

The video by itself would probably get only 3 or 4 stars. It took some figuring to place the camera in AF-F mode to get the focusing right. For the first few I was pressing the shutter half way down to force the focusing. The sound of the focusing motor is noticeable most of the time. The shotgun hot shoe microphone might help with that according to some reviews of it. But having a single device that can do both has definitely made it possible to get more videos of the kids. Picture wise, the video has been fantastic.

Definitely worth the price. Not sorry at all the I didn't go with the D5100.",12-24-2012,12-24-2012

The D3200 has a sensor which makes it better than D3100 & D3000, which are now very affordable.  As a online news provider, I needed quality photos as well as video for local events.  I have used quality point-and-shoot digital cams for awhile, which actually are not that bad, but has a limitation in controlling the shots & adding more quality.  I was at 16megapixels on point&shoot, but D3200 has 24megapixels, which isn't necessary a benefit of quality, but more size of the image.  My other option was The D5100 which looks attractive, too (esp. $50 cheaper than this D3200).  From research, the D5200 is coming out soon & this product should be much cheaper next year. Also, The Canon is a great competitor with each brand having its own advantages & disadvantages from color, accessories, & quality.  SInce I needed video, the Canon T3i & T4i was my second choice.

Here  is some more tips to get so much more out of this camera  do not but a cheap sdhc card  or class 4 no matter what people say it will slow down this camera buy the sdhc class 10 card i  get the sandisk extreme pro 16GB card or larger  due to raw size file  or the lexar  sdhc cards  that are 600x write speeds  i have no performance issue with these cards they  perform  amazing  well now if ur budget  allows you buy a sdxc  card they do well to but they are pricy.  I would invest in getting a battery grip for the camera it makes  balance and so much easier to hold get the Vello BG-N9 battery grip along with the Vello - Shutter Release Cable for BG-N9 it ties grip into the camera and adds another battery so u can shoot longer to. i have not regret gettting it  you will love it to just get those things i listed and u  will love it to  as for flash will it thats up to you  ? what u will  use it for  SB-910 and the SB-700 will do a great job ***************** update as of febuary 2013 i upgraded to a nikon D7000  there was nothing wroung with the D3200 just wonted more options to choose from the D3200 was a great camera to start off with i enjoy my time i spent with it i hope every other user enjoy it as much as i did,12-11-2012,12-11-2012

When the price dropped and Coke spilled into our Point and Shoot the time was right.

Have been playing with it for about 10 days, the menus were pretty easy to figure out once I learned about basic camera settings.  The Auto setting produced some of the best pictures I have taken, though considering what I was using before that may not be saying much.  Did not play with the guide mode, thought I would but we dove directly into the Manual mode which forced us to learn the settings.  The adjustments took reading the manual to figure out, but once we learned them they were easy to adjust on the fly (ISO, Shutter Speed and F-Stop).  As we worked through the settings, we were able to improve our skills and see the D3200 really shine.  Seems to take excellent low level light shots, and high speed action seemed to be no problem.  The detail was great on all the shots.

The setup menus were easy to figure out, thought they were quite intuitive.  Also the build quality is great, it was smaller than expected, but fits in the hands well, and has a solid feel.  The rear display looks great and is a good preview.  Data through the viewfinder was also easy to read and great as we learned how to adjust settings without using the info page.

Overall I would recommend it.  Through all the research I found that the more knowledgeable people were who reviewed it, the more they found that they complained about.  Now that I have it in hand, I realized that while what they are saying may be true, this is an entry level DSLR, and to the target audience, it does not matter.

Thank you Amazon!

I'm disappointed at some of the reviewers boasting they feel they got a D800 at a D3200 price.  This is STILL a D3200, and is meant for a very large, but very neophyte audience.  Nikon knew there were millions looking for a DSLR for $500 - maybe so they could say they had one.  Well here it is, and believe me you get what you pay for.  If you believe the egos of the prior reviewers, you'll certainly be disappointed when you try take this camera out of the simple, picture-led guide mode.

True, this camera is very much entry-level, but it's REAL entry level.  And the 24mp does not look like 24mp - unfortunately the way the computer processes the image it ends up looks more like 8mp.  The images are hard to describe - it's like they're synthesized or over manipulated.  Even the RAW seems compressed and lossy.  I saw a side-side close up analysis/review of the image, and although it's 24mp, most of the pixels in, say, a 20 pixel radius are all the same!  The camera doesn't have the power to distinguish the pixels for clarity like the higher end cameras.  Point and shoots do this as a matter of course, then they brag they have ""24mp"" etc which may be misleading some into thinking ""well 24mp is still 24mp"".  But it's not.  Go do your online homework and look at the analysis photos from this camera.  You'll see what I mean - and that pans out in real life.  Just one step up, the D7000 is 10x the camera, and yields much brighter photos.  It's sort of like an old round 50's style TV vs a new 90"" hi res LED TV.

It's plastic case gives it a chintzy feel, it's VERY slow at shot acquisition (you will certainly wait a bit till it's figured out how to take the shot), autofocus is awful even with $3000 glass, metering is whacked, short battery life you name a bad trait and this camera has it.  Oh - and don't get caught in the rain with it either.

However, it is lightweight.  And to some that's quite important.  Like a tourist that has to lug a his new SLR all over creation, when they're used to a little pocket camera.  This camera is 1/2 the weight of any DSLR.

And it also has a real dumbed-down ""guide"" that takes about 30 seconds to setup a shot - so that whole sophomoric 7th-grade level guide thing is a bust.  And the scene selector on top doesn't help at all either.  In both my wife's, my 24 yr old son, my and my Mom's use, about 30/50 shots were blurred, mis-flashed, mis-exposed to WAY out of proportions etc.  So why have 24mp for a camera that can't handle it?

The lens that it comes with (mandatory) is just more cheap plastic mess.  If this camera was sold w/o the lens it would be in the $299 range.  We put a $3k lens on this camera with little improvement - it still just can't cope.  Don't fool yourself into thinking you're clever by purchasing a $4000 camera for $400.  You've got a $400 camera.

But I wouldn't waste your time/money - get the D7000 and be done with it.  If you're that hard up for $$ where you can't/won't shell out another $200 for the pro camera, then go back to a point and shoot",11-12-2012,11-12-2012
https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-Digital-18-55mm-3-5-5-6-Focus-S/dp/B007VGGFZU?th=1,35,Electronics,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Auto Focus-S DX VR NIKKOR Zoom Lens (Black) (OLD MODEL),4.6,5,Exceptional Picture Quality and Values,"1) Picture quality: Exceptional for a supposedly-for-amateurs DSLR. I compare pictures taken with our Nikon D800, D300 and D40X, and our D3200 easily beats our D300 and D40X in terms of details, clarity and color depth, although still visibly not comparable to our D800 (which also benefits from its superior FX lenses). But with Photoshop on a 28-in HD monitor, besides the visibly more brilliant colors of the D800, I can only discern the D800's higher quality at 200% or higher magnification. At 100% (or Actual Pixels View) seeing the differences between our D3200 and D800 does require some careful examinations. It is no wonder DXO Marks ranks the D3200 among the best of Nikon professional and semi-professional DSLRs (Best of the Nikons: D800E (Best and also Industry Leader), D800, D600, D4, D3X, D3S, D3200, D3, D700, D7000; [...])
2) Ease of Use: The D3200 is so easy to use; there are many shooting modes to choose from with its top Dial. I typically only stay with Manual, Aperture-priority, Shutter-priority and (if in a point-and-shoot situation) Programmed-auto modes. But as with other (amateur's) Nikon DSLRs, the D3200 offers point-and-shoot (Auto, Auto Flash Off) and preset modes (Portrait, landscape, Child, Sports, Close-up, Night Portrait). And then there is GUIDE mode (with on-screen guides) as well.
3) Focus: There are many focus modes to give the maximum flexibility. However, I tend to stay with Spot (Single Area) Focus as I find with this much resolution, in high-magnification scrutiny, the Dynamic Area and the 3D Tracking Focus modes tend to give me a ""softer"" image.
4) Working with Nikkor DX lenses: The D3200 pictures are pretty much comparable in resolution with the D800 in DX mode with most of our DX lens collection, the only differences (visible at 200% or higher magnifications) are with our Nikkor DX 35mm F2.8 and Tokina DX 11-16mm F2.8 (which requires manual focus), where I can see better details than the D800 in DX mode (with DX lenses).
5) Working with Nikkor FX lenses (Manual Focus): Under very controlled situations and with a rigid tripod, the D3200 gives higher-detail results than the D800 in DX crop mode with our FX lenses.
6) No Auto-Focus with FX lens: Without an internal motor, the D3200 cannot auto-focus when the (superior) FX lenses are mounted. This manual focus requirement is not an issue for me - I just use the D3200 electronic range finder to focus my FX lenses.
7)Adjustments of Picture Quality: You can also choose how your picture quality can be controlled: Standard (default), Neutral, Vivid, Monochrome, Portrait, Landscape.
8) Active D-lighting: Very nice results when I face situations of high contrast. This is almost High-Dynamic-Range (HDR). However I usually have this off since I do post processing of the raw images with Photoshop.
OK, now some notes:
9) No bracketing: This is not an issue for me (personally I think this is an over-exaggerated feature anyway, I rarely use this capability with my D800, D300)
10) Light Metering: The D3200 Matrix metering has a tendency to overexpose a little in bright conditions; luckily it also offers exposure compensation up to a generous +/-5EV. I do advise that you take plenty of pictures in all metering modes as well as in Manual so you can tally up the effects and set the exposure compensation to get your best pictures results. Maybe Nikon will update the firmware to fix this.
11) SD Card: Please make sure you use the fastest card you can afford. The D3200 files (especially if you shoot RAW (NEF) and JPEG Fine together) are large and the camera does take time to store and display images.
12) HD Video Recording: The D3200 new 1080p25 and 1080p30 modes in addition to 1080p24 produce very nice videos - Live View is great - I find the continuous focusing during movie recording not only visually distracting but noisy and I just avoid it altogether and use single AF (AF-S) or manual focus for movies
13) The tabbed menu system with long pages does take some getting used to (it does appear cumbersome at first).
---Update---
5) I've found no auto-focus issues with the majority of my FX lenses (AF-S and AF-I). However, besides the 1.5X factor, the minor issue is the D3200 does not quite cover the view 100% in its viewfinder; please keep this in mind when composing your picture with the FX lenses, as your actual picture will be not be as large as what you see in the viewfinder.
10) After careful note-taking for a couple hundred photos, I've found that setting the D3200 to -1EV has yielded results pretty close to manually compensating the exposure via the viewfinder in most cases, including the case of the subject against strong bright background.",11-10-2012,11-10-2012

Long exposure night shots have been great, both with the kit 18-55mm lens and the Tamron 70-300mm lens.  I wish it did have some effect modes like the point and shoot cameras have as well as other brand DSLR's (IE sepia mode, etc..) That can also be done in post processing though.  The software that comes with the camera also seems to work great for some minor post processing work, especially just shifting white balance and things.  I picked up a wireless remote and corded shutter release at the same time as well as polarizing and UV filters.  Focusing could be a little faster, but at this price point I am not complaining.

The camera itself is very light, so a large lens throws it a little off balance.

My biggest complaint is the optional wireless adapter.  I bought it because it said you could use it as a shutter release.  You cannot use it as a shutter release if live mode is active, and you can only use it to trigger the shutter, you cannot use it to do a long exposure in bulb mode.

The app is also a little flaky, if you let your tablet/phone go to sleep while you are transferring photos from the camera it cancels the transfer.  I installed an app called ""Wake Lock"" from the Google Play to keep the tablet awake, once that was done images transferred fine.

I hope to update this as I get to use the camera more.",11-08-2012,11-08-2012

Must be a great camera,"Well I ordered this camera because the temptation was too great. I already have a SONY NEX 5n and a PAnasonic GF3 and for the price i thought this camera was a great buy based on reviews I have seen on the web. I think this is a good camera for the entry level range of users who are upgrading to a DSLR. I see a lot of people boast about the size of the camera being a lot smaller then most other DSLRs and all I can say is the other cameras must be monsters because this is not a small camera by any means.
I gave this camera 4stars because i think it is a very capable camera for the price and I didn't think it fair to give a lower rating because of my bias towards the Micro 4/3 cameras. I am not a professsional but I am getting into photography more and more. To be honest I didn't think the video when taken in lower lighting indoors was that great and every picture taken indoors with fairly well lit lighting during the day wasn't the most crisp pictures i have taken. I used Aperture priority without a flash and had the aperture open fully and let the camera do the ISO and shutter. My Panasonic GF3 and SONY NEX seemed to get better results. I have to say it was nice to look through a viewfinder again as my last cameras were all in a LiveView type of config.
As far as the build and fell of the camera it seemed pretty cheap feeling. I had to go for the red color because i thought it was nice to have a different look to it other then black. Hey, if you want pretty picture you ned a pretty camera right? lol. It has a cheap plastic feel to it but it wasn't a show stopper by any means. I don't see myself dragging this camera to get pictures on a daily basis. More of a specialty kind of usage because of its size. The Micro 4/3 i can take anywhere more easily and it does the same thing even better.
I just want to say after reading a lot of reviews on AMazon and elsewhere I truly believe that only a couple people mentioned that you can take great pictures with a point and shoot and a DSLR for everyday use. If all your doing is going around taking shots of your friends drinking beer and partying then most cameras would do the trick but if you want a night shot of the moon or fireworks or Christmas lights you will need a DSLR with all the programming modes. One other key thing i have heard people preach about photography is it's all about the glass in front of the sensor. Mostly true as a good lens can make a difference.
My next purchase will be a mid range camera or high end one when I get better at picture taking. I dread trying to find a camera when I am ready, 16, 18 , 24 megapixels.. this one has external mic, this one doesn't, this one has bracketing but why did they remove it from this camera, this one has 1080 in 30, 24, this one has noise at 1600 ISO.. blah blah blah. OMG shoot me now. Too much choice clouds judgement.
If I owned a camera company i would make two types of  cameras, one entry level and one Pro with all the features. It's crazy all the different models every manufacturer has out there, ridiculous.

In the end I returned this camera because i like my two Micro 4/3 cameras and well.. I didn't feel that spending $600 was worth it getting a camera that does the same thing as my other two.",11-03-2012,11-03-2012

I looked at the file sizes and they are not 24mp but 20mp.
So Nikon has truncated the file size. You have to look at the file sizes in your PC or Nikon instruction book to discover this fact. The point is that what is advertised is not so. Also when you bring the camera up to your eye the glare from the monitor panel is disburbing. Looks like the only way to get around this is to turn off the display. All in all my personal opinion is that the Nikon D5100 at todays prices is a better bargain and better operating camera all around. Image quality was okay but no noticable differences compared to Nikon D5100 which I made several hundred exposures with. I am returning this product.",10-26-2012,10-26-2012

The kit lens is all very well and plenty-good-enough for casual shooting, but making the most of 24 megapixels suggests the use of better optics, such as the fixed-focal-length Nikkor 60mm f/1.8, and flash or a tripod.  Older lenses won't autofocus with the D3200--you need the newer AF-S models--but you can focus manually with any lens using a built-in rangefinder function which is buried in the menu system.
There are compromises with the D3200, just as there are with any entry-level camera.  The autofocus hunts a little in low light and with low-contrast scenes, burst mode isn't that fast, video playback flickers, and the memory chip needs a little time to swallow each RAW shot.  If you're not a pro, you don't need a camera that grabs each shot with the voracity of an Australian salt-water crocodile.  If you think you do, the D800 may be worth your kilobucks.
You can take this camera out of the box, charge it up, fire away in auto mode, and get 16x20 enlargements of excellent image quality--just as photographers have been doing for years with 5-megapixel point-and-shoots.

Many things have changed since then, including the price and the competition in the market. END OF UPDATE.

I had a chance to try this camera for two weeks with my Nikon lens collection. I compared it to my D5100 and a D7000.
I skip repeating the features and specifications and just mention my final impression after using the camera in different conditions and with various lenses.

1. It is getting too small. A DSLR should be comfortable to hold. D5100 was on the small size too and now this one is a bit smaller. i use a battery grip with my D5100 for maximum grip and comfort.

2. Photos, out of camera, are not as smooth as those taken with D5100 and D7000. The extra megapixels didn't really add to the final picture quality, in my opinion.

3. Exposure is unpredictable and often on the overexposure side. I tried it in various lighting conditions. I am well aware that they are fixable both in and out of camera, but is it too much to ask to have nice photos when I pay quite a few hundred dollars?

4. Video quality is comparable to D5100. 60fps is a welcome change though.

5. It is expensive for what it is. It is perhaps targeting the first-time DSLR buyers with the wrong price tag. You can do much better if you are willing to spend that much. (I am referring to the price as of August 2012. Its price may be adjusted in near future.) You are better off buying less expensive DSLR and save money to spend on better quality lenses. Keep reading below for recommendations.

My recommendations (These are in case you have decided to buy a Nikon DSLR):
1. If you can, wait for D5200 (it is not out yet as of August 2012),
2. Get a D5100. It packs an impressive array of feature for the price,
3. Get a less expensive one if an entry level camera is what you are looking for. D3100 should be on sale these days,
4. I do not recommend D7000. It is a nice and able camera, of course. And I know that it has an impressive autofocus system. The difference just doesn't justify the hefty price tag for me. D5100 sports the very same sensor and produces identical picture quality for much less money.",08-23-2012,08-23-2012

I recently, left for a trip to India and took some 2000+ photos , bird sanctuaries, himalayas etc.. Photos were amazing, I will have to admit i used 70-200mm Nikkor lens (its about 2399). Photos were amazing. Live view is wonderful with 1080p HD vidoes camera does some wonderful things.. I wanted to buy D800, with are the reviews about focus issues , I have lost faith in Pro model from Nikon. This one is awesome. This little camera might not have all the features that D800 boasts about, but Hey, I can buy 4 3200's for the price of D800 and don't have to return to Nikon and wait with the tounge hanging out for it to return from repairs.

Update -- 01/03/2013

Now that the camera has been used for 6 months, buttons on the back are loose. Compression of images produces a pink bar on the Right hand side of the image. Continious frames are the cause of that pink bar. Its very prominent in RAW files and not much with JPEG.But i can live with it since, I crop my images. But that should not be happening. Next is Focus sometimes it misses it completely and try to focus on another focus point even though its not selected. Still, a good camera for the price. But, don't expect to work like a semi-pro. Will replace it with D7000. I know, D7000 is due its replacement. But,my rule of thumb is never buy something thats not tested. Expecially, when 600 and 800 has shown its ugly faces of oil spots and left focus issues respectively. Happy clicking.!!!!",08-22-2012,08-22-2012

It was a jump from 35, but the D3200 is fantastic. I'm getting great details and vibrant colors after just a little time shooting. The images are clear and crisp from 100 to 3200 ISO/ASA with slightly noticeable noise around 6400.

One thing to note is that, if you don't know how to completely utilize the camera, the images will be bad, or underwhelming. I recommend trying to familiarize yourself with some of the slightly more advanced features. After using a completely manual 35 I had no problem diving into some of these features and they helped a lot. Try to stay away from the auto features and go into shutter priority, aperture priority, and manual shutter modes.

The image effects are present, but I wouldn't say any of them are particularly impressive. Yes you can give your image a sort of older appearance, but if that's the kind of shooting you go for regularly, I would recommend just using an old camera and some expired film.

I would recommend this camera to most people who are looking at entering the DSLR market. I take that back. If you'rte looking to get into DSLR, this is a great choice. One note, just because the MP is twice some other cameras, doesn't mean the pictures are twice as good right away. You need to get comfortable with changing settings you normally would just leave alone.

I know I listed some negatives, but it still gets 5 stars because it's good at what it does. If you're filming, spend $600 on a video camera, and you'll be pretty good for the civilian market.",08-18-2012,08-18-2012

It's really a lot of fun to use and feels well built.

I got the D3200 a few months ago. The picture quality is excellent but video recording is no good. Video focusing is the issue. The focus is very slow, and the stock lens makes a lot of noise when focusing. When I record moving people I usually resort to manually focusing the lens. Also, the D3200 also can only record 1080 at a maximum of 30fps, which is very noticeable when compared to 60fps - especially when recording rapidly moving subjects. At 30fps moving objects seem jittery and move unnaturally. Due to these issues, I use my iPhone almost exclusively for video. I didn't expect a DSLR to take perfect video, but I assumed it would be better than my cell phone. I break out the D3200 usually only in low light conditions. I also feel that the videos are soft.

The extremely slow focusing has made the camera useless for recording video. Imagine this, you are focused on a subject and the person moves two feet farther from the camera, the camera does not realize this and does nothing. So, you hold down the shutter button which tells the camera to refocus. Now the camera cycles through being completely unfocused to properly focused - this gives me a headache when I watch it later. So obtrusive.

The photo quality is excellent. The only gripe I have is the custom white balance - you must go through numerous menus every time you want to adjust it. I have a simple canon point and shoot camera that allows me to customize the white balance with two clicks.",08-02-2012,08-02-2012

In the past, I've shot with Sony, Canon, Fujifilm, Mamiya Sekor, and some others that I can't remember.  I have no brand loyalty; I will use any camera that is able to generate good images on a consistent basis.  Most of my shooting is outdoors, daytime (dawn to dusk) using burst shooting and telephoto at or near 300mm (450mm ff equivalent), but of course there are exceptions.  I do a lot of shooting in very high-contrast situations (brilliant white sunlit foam against a dark blue sea or shaded cliffs, for example).  I do a lot of cropping and/or enlarging for prints up to 20x16in or larger.

My comments on the D3200 are based on expectations and comparisons with results obtained with other cameras, mainly the K-5 (using kit lenses) and the FZ150.  I also did the same shots fairly recently with the Pentax K-r (which I sold to upgrade to the K-5) and a Fuji S100FS (superzoom bridge camera with 2/3in sensor, 11MP and 14.3 optical zoom, which was great but not quick enough in burst mode), and those results also enter into my evaluation.

My purpose in buying the D3200 was:
1. Get higher resolution than I have with the K-5 or FZ150.
2. Have something that would be a bit lighter than the K-5, while matching it in IQ.
3. Have decent burst speed and depth.  (With the K-5 I shoot a lot at 7fps; with the FZ150 I alternate between 5.5 and 12fps.  All at full resolution, RAW.)

Beyond this, I was going to be pretty easy to please.  I don't do much low-light shooting, and I don't mind doing PP.

The good:
--The D3200 is a nice camera in terms of design, pretty well laid out.
--The D3200 feels good in the hand, is well balanced, and light yet solid.
--The kit 55-300 lens functions well and smoothly, and is solid, with a metal bayonet mount that works easily and firmly.
--The LCD is a real delight.  Very bright, good resolution and contrast, very easy to read.  (And I am a committed VF user. ;0)
--Battery and memory card doors are light but don't feel flimsy; they are well designed for quick opening and closing.
--The burst at 4fps (RAW or JPEG) is acceptable for many action shots, and steady.
--The VR (anti-shake) works very well and hand-held full-zoom (300mm) shots are clear at 1/180.  (I didn't go below this shutter speed yet.)
--AF is quick and reliable.  (In a complex physical environment, it's most effective if you select single point focus as otherwise the camera may focus on something other than your intended subject, but this isn't unusual.)
--Color and WB are very good right out of the box.

The not so good:
--Unfortunately, at present there is no substitute battery available, so you must pay between $40 and $50 for a Nikon battery.  Both Pentax and Panasonic also charge a lot for their batteries, but other totally acceptable options (which I have as backup) are available for a fraction of the price.
--Another drawback is the NEF Raw format used in the D3200.  Unless you have CS5 (or maybe CS6) or equivalent, you can't process D3200 NEF images in Photoshop.  (You can process earlier versions of NEF, but NEF keeps evolving.)  Luckily, there are free programs like Raw Therapee, Irfanview and FastStone which do read NEF from this camera.  Of course, there is also NX2 (Nikon PP software) which you can download off the internet or from the CD with the camera.  It's a good program for  improving image IQ, but lacks layers and other features found in PhotoShop.  You also can convert to Adobe DNG (which is read by PhotoShop and other programs); the free DNG Converter may be downloaded off the net.  Be sure to get Version 7.1; earlier versions will not work with D3200 NEF (I found this out the hard way).
--There are a couple of shortcomings in the controls, but most of the main functions are quickly accessed and changed by pushing the ""I"" button on the lower left of the back of the camera (below the lower left corner of the LCD).
--The camera has an irritating eagerness to make you use the LCD to view your settings.  It would be nice to have full information easily accessible through the viewfinder, instead of having to take the camera away from your eye.  Example: to switch to and from burst shooting, you have to use the LCD screen to make changes; when you push the burst button (which is a very nice thing to have), the only change menu appears on the LCD, not in the viewfinder.
--The D3200, like many other cameras, has a tendency to overexpose.  This is easy to remedy by setting EV at -2/3 or so.
--Leave the in-camera sharpening on; images are very soft without it.
--Bracketing, histogram, DOF preview: all missing.  These aren't fatal flaws, but the rest of the camera had better be very good to compensate.

The bad:
--IQ is a major disappointment.  I have a number of standard shots that I take with every camera I try or buy; I have done this so many times that I have a very clear idea of what is possible and what reasonable expectations are.  Again, I'm comparing this camera specifically with the K-5 (16mp on an APS-C sensor, kit lens 55-300mm) and the FZ150 (superzoom, 12mp on a small 1/2.3 sensor).  Recent experiences with the K-r (12mp, APS-C), the Canon T2i (kit zoom lens) and the Fujifilm S100fs (11mp, 2/3in sensor, bridge zoom camera) also enter into my appraisal.

In every one of my standard shots, the D3200 performed worse (in terms of IQ) than the K-5 (and K-r) and often worse than the FZ150.  When shooting at full zoom, definition was poor and fine details were often fuzzy or smeared.  With in-camera noise reduction turned off, noise was often evident.  With either of the other two cameras at full zoom, you generated an image that allowed you to count the roof tiles on a house well over half a mile away, and read license plates at 400 to 500 yards.  The K-r was the same, and the Fuji S100 was close.  The D3200 does not have this capability.

You might say, well, sure, it's probably the fault of the kit lens.  But my K-5 has a kit lens, and the FZ150 itself IS a kit lens, as was the Fuji S100fs, and they all did better on the same shots.  At any rate, the D3200 doesn't seem like a hot enough camera to warrant spending serious money to put top-quality glass on it.  And again, the K-5 didn't require this, nor did the K-r.

You might also say, well, yeah, but who shoots all day at 300mm?  I don't know, but why limit yourself right from the start?  If the camera/lens combo can't do this, I'm going to miss out on a lot of shots.

Apparently, I'm not the only one who is underwhelmed by the images from the D3200.  Here's what dpreview had to say on the subject: ""resolution and detail aside the Nikon D3200 has no image quality issues of note.""  Hardly a ringing endorsement of the camera's IQ.

Bottom line: the purpose of making pictures is to get good results, and the main ingredient is IQ.  I will take a couple of days to try some adjustments and see if I can get better results, but if it's this much harder than it is with my other cameras, I'm not optimistic.

IQ is closely related to pixel size; in general smaller pixel size can be detrimental, and the D3200 has pixels that are quite small for a DSLR.

Larger pixels offer enhanced light gathering ability and a higher signal-to-noise ratio.  Higher pixel counts on the same size sensor create a tradeoff.  To use one common metaphor that equates pixels to light-gathering ""buckets,"" having more, but smaller buckets (pixels) on the same surface area (sensor size) doesn't mean you can collect more water (light).  In fact, the shape and necessary circuitry of each pixel create wasted, non-light gathering areas in addition to generating electronic noise.

Here's how Wikipedia puts it:  ""The size of the image sensor, or effective light collection area per pixel sensor, is the largest determinant of signal levels that determine signal-to-noise ratio and hence apparent noise levels ...more pixels within a given sensor area will make the image noisier.""

Here's a comparison of pixel sizes for a number of DSLR cameras.  The D800 is a full-frame, 36mp camera; the others are APS-C (a generic term which includes slightly differing surface areas and proportions).

The red is nice, but my wife already put a very small chip in the paint (and we don't know how as she's normally very careful with it).

Not sure if this speaks for the quality of the housing but it should as it's lacking.

It takes great pictures, and we're not professional photographers.

While it looks almost the same as the D3100 on the outside, it's a whole new camera on the inside. Greatly improved video. Various feature improvements that I'm sure everyone knows about, and of course, a 24 megapixel sensor.  My biggest concern when deciding to buy this camera was noise - however, Nikon has done a great job on this sensor coupled with the new Expeed 3 processor.  Noise is LESS than with the D3100 and it ""only"" has 14 megapixels.  It is MUCH better with noise than the otherwise fantastic Sony A65, also with a 24mp sensor (and better than the A77 as well). Dynamic range is better than the D3100 as well.

Yes, it still lacks some of the bells and whistles you expect to get with pricier camera bodies, and certainly noisier than full frame sensor cameras, but that's a whole different ball game. For the price nothing else can touch this great little camera at the moment, in my humble opinion.  If you're buying an entry level Nikon at this price point it might be a toss up between the D3200 and the D5100 now that the latter has dropped in price. The D5100 has more operational features, an articulating LCD panel and similar video, but the D3200 has 8 additional megapixels of resolution and somewhat better dynamic range with very similar noise profiles. While some people many think 24mp is too much or unecessary, I love it. Detail and resolution with a decent lens is fantastic and gives you many more options for cropping, printing, etc. You can produce amazing results even using the Kit Lens with a little care.

The D3200 has some advanced features over the D40 that make it easier to use and it also seems to have more accurate exposure metering, especially when in the ""auto"" mode. I like the fact that the infrared remote shutter release that i used with the D40 also works on the D3200. The camera is light weight and compact for a DSLR, so it is well suited for hiking and biking. The photos are superb! Very sharp and crisp! I only wish it had a timer which would take a photo every so many second or minutes, etc. It has excellent build quality and feels good in your hands. It is well worth the money, which is very reasonable. I do not care for the ""Live View"" feature.

I say that because the D3200 is certainly a camera that is worthy for an advanced or professional photographer. In fact, the D3200 is a marvel since it is possible for a novice to take professional looking photographs with only a few hours of study, but it will also allow a professional all of the capability that they would want for premium quality prints.

Notes -

Image Quality - Absolutely top-notch - the Nikon D3200 takes super crisp photos with excellent color representation. The additional functionality allows more advanced users to maximize light, shutter speed, and zoom/focal points.

Why 24.2MP? - Why does someone want a camera with such high resolution? Well the answer is pretty straight-forward. A high resolution camera will allow you to zoom and crop any portion of your photograph without worrying about the image becoming grainy. This will allow you to zoom to a small area of interest and blow-it-up to a full scale print.

Multiple ISO Sensitivity Settings - The various ISO settings allow for changing light sensitivity without loss of image quality. This is similar to the ""speed setting"" of film cameras and the 100,400, etc films of previous years.

- Fit and Functionality - The Nikon D3200 feels great in you hands. While it is not *pocket sized* compared to the cheaper smaller cameras it is still light enough that you will not be fatigued after a day of shooting.

- Outputs/Inputs - The Nikon D3200 has inputs for a mic and GPS and it has HDMI and a standard AV output.

- VIdeo - The D3200 will take up to 20minutes of video at 1080P - the video quality is excellent.... I am not sure I would call it the equivalent of a full 1080P camcorder (Due to image stabilization and frame speed) it will certiainly work in a pinch.

- Burst Mode - The camera will take 4photos/second in a burst. This will help you find the *right* shot even during an accidental blink. If you have never used a camera with burst mode you will be amazed at how much easier this makes in taking photos of children.

Buffer - The Nikon D3200 has an internal buffer of (up to) 100 photos. This will allow you take a multitude of high resolution photos without having to wait for the camera to write to your memory card. On the topic of memory cards you will certainly only want to buy class 10 memory cards.

Camera Modes -

 - Portrait - Used for Portraits with soft natural-looking skin tones. If the subject is far from the camera the background details will be softened.
 - Night Portrait - Use for a natural balance between the main subject and the background in portraits taken in low light.
 - Landscape - For vivid landscape shots when ample light is present.
 - Sports - Fast shutter speeds freeze motion in order to capture fast acting sports moments.
 - Close-up - For close up photos of flowers, photos, and small images taken at very close range.
 - Child Use for snapshots of children. Clothing and background details are vividly rendered while skin tones remain soft and natural.

Final Verdict - Whether you a re a novice, intermediate, or advanced photographer you will likely be very pleased with the Nikon D3200. While you will need to spend a few hours with the manual all levels of photographers will be able to take stunning photographs. Highly Recommended!

Things I liked about this camera:

Small, light weight, fast and delivers straight out of the box

Comfortably fits into mine, my wife's and son's hand (Personal choice)

Great image quality

Excellent color

Great detail, especially when that 24 MP turns in our favor (by using right lens and technique)

Very good video quality

I had checked the specs before I placed the order and hence I already had an idea about what is there and what is not there as far as features are concerned. Investing on a 35mm/50mm prime lens is worth considering for no-flash shoots at low light.

Overall, Nikon D3200 is an excellent DSLR",06-29-2012,06-29-2012

But check out the Sony NEX 5n,"Recently I had a weekend opportunity (borrowing from friends) to get my hands simultaneously on this D3200, a new D800E, a Fujifim XPro-1 and a Sony NEX 5n, and I was able to compare them all, head to head on the same scene at the same ISO, both JPEG and RAW. Of course they all had different lenses, but I tried to minimize the variance by shooting at f8.

As expected, the D800E was the best IQ, but the differences are subtle. At ordinary ISO, the D3200 was not as far behind as one might expect. Entry level DSLR's are a very competitive market segment and Nikon went all out in trying to pack in as much as they could for the price. The D3200 falls behind mostly at high ISO (3200). But of course the D800E costs more than five times as much as the D3200; is it really five times better? No, it is maybe 50% better for five times the price and twice the weight. Also the D3200 is much smaller and uses smaller, cheaper lenses. So the D3200 wins in terms of value for sure, especially if you plan to take most of your pictures in good light - those images were excellent, sparkling and clean.

If you are interested in the other results, you can check out my XPro1 review linked below. The XPro1 images were remarkable; except for pixel count (16 MP vs. 36 MP for the D800E), the JPG's were almost as good as the full frame Nikon. Of course the XPro1 is also very expensive and idiosyncratic in other ways and it doesn't really compete with the D3200. It is a camera for rich dentists, not ordinary folk. The Sony NEX 5n on the other hand, is about the same price as the D3200 and is also impressive. At high ISO, the NEX gives nicer results than the D3200 but not quite as nice as the D800 or XPro1. If you want a camera which is much smaller than the D3200 but has comparable or slightly better image quality, check out the Sony. But there are many more lenses available for Nikon, and the SLR type viewfinder is still the easiest to use in my opinion (the NEX 5n LCD is better for street photography because less intimidating).

Bottom line is that D3200 is excellent and a bargain, and most people will be very happy with it.

I should have downloaded the camera's manual at the Nikon site prior to ordering it.  It doesn't allow for bracketing of shots and anything you need to change seems to have be done through the menu screen in the camera.  It is very light.

I wanted a D3200 in RED but they are unavailable still, so I opted for the black. Only difference is case color. I've been too busy to really learn how to use the tools well, as photography is a hobby for me, not a profession. The D3200 has a lot of features and my first DSLR.  It's physically smaller and lighter than I had expected and that is a nice feature. I bought an optional hand strap attachment (Opteka Professional Wrist Grip Strap for Digital & Film SLR Cameras) that helps me, as I have large hands. The D3200 kit comes with a 18-55MM VR DX lens but no lens hood, so I elected to buy the Nikon HB-45 Replacement Lens Hood for 18-55mm VR Lens. Good choice. The hood fits perfectly and doesn't block flash.  The optional AC power supply and adapter cord set is not currently available (Nikon EH-5A AC Adapter and Nikon EP-5a Power Supply Connector for EH-5a AC Adapter) in the US at this time.

Here's my bullet-point run-down of the good and the bad:

Good:
- 24 megapixels
- Good low-light performance, ISO goes to 6400, Hi1 (12800): ISO 3200 image here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo2U3CW1XBEB88Q/B007VGGFZU/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link
  (see DxOMark's Web page for details on the signal-to-noise ratio of this camera's sensor)
- HD video capability (improved since the D3100) plus microphone jack
- IR remote sensors on front and back of camera
- Active D-lighting
- Small size and light weight
- 4+ frames per second

Bad(ish):
- No bracketing
- JPEGs are a bit soft, even in ""Fine"" mode (only a concern if you are cropping heavily)
- must buy with kit lens (18-55mm with VR- not a bad lens)

For context: I am an experienced amateur photographer.  I like the capability, small size and low weight of the D3200.  I have large hands, but do not have any trouble using the D3200.  The large number of megapixels will permit extra cropping, but Nikon's JPEG compression limits how much you'll want to do this (unless you shoot in RAW, of course).  High ISO settings permit shooting in our middle school auditorium without introducing too much noise.  Note that, as with all entry-level Nikon DSLRs, the D3200 does not have a motor drive for autofocusing lenses, so all lenses without an internal motor will be manual focus only.",06-19-2012,06-19-2012

I have already taken a workshop with a professional on how to get me shooting in the Manual mode for most of my shots and use the other modes when circumstances call for it.

Pictures are really vivid, great colors and much more closer to real colors of the environment, focusing is not different from D90 although is accurate and fast enough, it is very handy and much more lighter than D90 and handling is quite easy. the settings are very easily adjusted and lacking the other dial is really not making any difference to me at all.

I did not even use the 18-55mm lens and since I opened the box I added my Nikkor 35-f1.8 which is a huge addon to this camera.

resolution is interestigly not double but triple or more of the D90 actually. I know it is only twice of that but really much more improvement you'll see when compare those two.

colors, colors, colors, I love those. I am sure no other camera with in this price range can be compared to it. and even better ones can pass the scores in a hard way.
it is magnificent and no one will regret buying it.

Thank you Nikon.

Update 06/08/12:
I can't resist my temptation to state that it is more than what someone can expect from a $700 DSLR. the pictures are magnificent. Focusing is really fast and accurate even in total darkness. I love this box and happy for exchanging it with my D90. Resolution is unbilievably high and colors are really vivid. I have uploaded a few flower pictures in full resolution.

The performance is amazing in addition to the 18-55 kit lens being outstanding.  I also purchased a Nikon 35mm lens to go with the camera and will review it after working with it.

All of the controls on the D3200 seem to be placed with care and are so intuitive to use that I feel like I've had the camera for years.  The menu system is also quite intuitive and anyone who has ever used a DSLR before (whether Nikon or not) will find it very easy to work with.

The material the camera is made from appears to be quite sturdy as does the construction of the camera.  A typical Nikon product...excellent.  The feel of the D3200 is quite good.  The only thing I'd change is the grip.  As other reviews have stated, it appears to be made for smaller hands.  But certainly not a deal breaker.

It's fast, comfortable to hold and shoot with, the menu system is intuitive, and LCD is much improved over the D3100. It feels solid and well-made and could stand up to the weight of a more pro-grade lens.

The camera has solid image quality but perhaps slightly inferior noise performance when compared to its predecessor. If you are an everyday, casual shooter and not shooting much at ISO1600 and above (and not blowing your images up to huge sizes or doing heavy cropping) you will be perfectly happy with the picture quality from this camera. Especially if you're stepping up from a point and shoot. The camera displays good color reproduction, and the 18-55 kit lens is probably one of the best kit lenses to be offered by a cameramaker out there in terms of its optical performance. Dynamic range is excellent. It does overexpose some, so you might want apply some negative exposure compensation in bright conditions (other Nikon DSLRs have had this issue in the past as well).

One disappointing feature that was on the D3100 but not of the D3200 is the drive mode switch on the top of the camera near the mode-dial. Also the switch between movie and video has been replaced with a button.

The video is pretty good on this camera. I have not messed around too much with the video but from the footage I have taken so far, the video has been sharp and clean.

Even though there is a slight drop in the imaging performance on this camera (again, unlikely to be noticed by casual shooters and even enthusiasts), I still reccommend it over the older D3100 due to the increase in performance and the higher LCD resolution. A very enjoyable camera to shoot with and will provide many years of great photos and dependable operation.",06-01-2012,06-01-2012

Even when using a prime lens (35mm/1.8 in my case) I can still see noticeable softness when viewing images at 100%. Even more so when using the 18-55mm kit lens. Still, there is more resolution in images under ideal conditions compared to the D5100, which I also own. Overall I prefer the D5100 images for sharpness, dynamic range, colors and low light noise.

One other thing I noticed with my D3200 is that the VR on the kit lens can introduce blurring of images. Shooting at 55mm and 1/100 shutter speed (which Auto ISO and auto min shutter speed option will select and should be considered sufficient to eliminate camera shake) causes shaking which is visible in images. Only when switching VR off that blurriness is gone (this also means I can hold the camera steady enough). Also, I could observe the same with the 55-200mm lens at 55mm. So I don't think it is a lens issue. So I will keep VR on the kit lens off when shooting in good light. For the 55-200 however this is more complicated as at the 200mm tele end the VR switched on seems always better.

Edit: upgraded the rating to 4/5 stars since there is a workaround to the issues I found. Also, I didn't want this review to be seen as negative.

Update: The image softness at 100% pixel level is caused by the in camera jpeg processing. I just developed some of the RAW/NEF images taken with the 35/1.8 lens in good light and low ISO and they come out clear and sharp at the pixel level (with a little extra sharpening applied). Also there is more detail in areas of lower contrast from the NEF developed images compared to the jpegs from the camera.",05-31-2012,05-31-2012

Beginners can of course use it too due to the pre-programmed shooting modes.

Besides the pre-programmed shooting modes it is literally loaded with advanced features which is a huge advantage for the experienced user.
The Info screen gives quick access to often used setup items like image quality, white balance, release mode etc. and the programmable Fn button on the left side
on the front gives quick access to setting the ISO (by default).

So don't get fooled by the low price, this is really a great camera with excellent output and I would say that it could easily be used by professional photographers
with a good lens mounted (at least as a backup camera).

I have owned several Nikons including the D700 and my conclusion is that you can't go wrong with this camera, but be aware that the image files are quite large

The major difference between these two cameras is the D3200's new Sony sensor with much higher resolution; 24MP vs 14MP for the D3100.  The LCD screen on the D3200 also appears brighter and sharper than the D3100 LCD and about the same as the D5100 (but not movable like the D5100 LCD Screen).  Notwithstanding the different sensors, the photographs taken with each camera (especially at lower ISO settings) look almost identical.  I have reviewed the D3100 seperately here on Amazon.

  Photographs taken with the D3200 are richly saturated and highly detailed.  An external flash with bounce capabilities (ie SB-400) greatly enhances expsoure and color indoors.  The only quibbles I have (and this is also true for the D3100 and D5100) is the automatic white balance bias towards yellow under incandescent lighting resulting in an artificially warm look. Manual adjustment of the white balance provides better color accuracy under artificial lighting.  There is no dedicated white balance button or white balance bracketing option.  Also, the D3200 tends to overexpose quite a bit outdoors (similar to previous lower end Nikons) but doesn't underexpose indoors as the D3100 sometimes does.  The overexposure is easily fixed by adjusting the exposure compensation or by spot metering. There is no exposure bracketing option.

  The AutoFocus on the D3200, like every other Nikon DSLR I have ever used, is very quick and accurate under all lighting conditions.

  This camera (as does the D3100 & D5100) uses the EN-EL14 battery.  Only a battery actually manufactured by Nikon ($40+) and not a generic 3rd party battery will work.  Consequently, having a spare battery is a bit of a luxury with this camera.

  The megapixel count of the D3200 may be overkill for most people especially this camera's target audience.  The D3100 14 megapixel count (D5100 16 MP) is more than sufficient unless you plan to print highway billboards. The file size of .jpg files generated by the D3200 is over 12MB (almost the size of the D40's raw files).  An advantage of these larger resolution files is the ability to crop photographs without any issue of having a small remaining file size.

  The extra megapixels does NOT improve the image quality or amount of detail being captured.  The dynamic range of this camera (the difference between the brightest and darkest part of the picture that show detail) for .jpg files is excellent and appears about the same as the D3100 and D5100 at base ISO using the kit lens (and Active D-Lighting turned on).

  There is a downside to the D3200's higher resolution; a bit of increased visible noise at high ISO levels specifically at ISO 1600 and 3200.  Comparing photographs taken on identical subjects at identical conditions using the same lens at 1600 or 3200 ISO on the D3100 and D3200, shows a little cleaner photographs on the D3100 (and the D5100).  Reducing the file size from ""Large"" to ""Normal"" does improve things a bit; perhaps this setting lowers the MP count.  In this context, it would be helpful if there was more than one ISO stop between 800 and 3200 (there is just one stop at 1600) as well as a dedicated ISO button so that one didn't have to navigate through a menu to adjust the ISO.

  In summary, the D3200 is a very nice camera capable of taking very sharp photographs.  Like all cameras, the most important component is the skill and imagination of the photographer.  The D3200 is not a worthwhile upgrade in my opinion from the D3100 unless you place great importance on the ability to crop a very small portion of a photograph.  The D3100 and D5100, which are both less expensive than the D3200, are simply better cameras for most people. Incidentally,  I did not use the video or live view so obviously I can not comment on these features.

6-4-12 UPDATE:  Within the last day or so, CNET and Cameralabs.com have each issued their respective comprehensive reviews of the D3200.  These are the first actual reviews by a major web site of the D3200 that I am aware of.  These reviews confirm that although the D3200 has some improved specifications over the D3100 (higher resolution for sure), the image quality of the older (and less expensive) D3100 is better than the D3200.  Specifically CameraLabs rated the image quality of the D3100 18/20 and the image quality of the D3200 17/20.  Consequently if image quality and value are important criteria, the D3100 should be given strong consideration over the D3200.",05-21-2012,05-21-2012

I kind of felt, I could get some training by shooting high megapixel images on this entry level camera.

My first outing after the camera arrived was to some birdpark with absolutely no prior preparation. The manual is still in the box, only charged the battery overnight and brought a selection of lenses in addition to the kit lens.

First surprise, even the kit ""plastic"" lens performs really nicely on this camera. Due to the nature of the objects of interest, the remaining shoots were done on a 28-300mm.

I was accompanied by an experienced bird photographer and we took turns with the camera. Both made the following observations: From the angle of experienced Nikon users, this camera offers everything in terms of menus and dials to set the camera up the way one is used to from D90, D7000, D300s level cameras. This came as a surprise, as the D3200 does not have the front dial that we both were used to and familiar with. Nikon has done an surprisingly good job in making the menus very easy to access and after a short while, we where entirely concentrated on the shoot and only occasionally reminding ourself that this was ""only"" an entry-level DSLR.

At the same time, we were impressed how nice the software is tailored to the needs of a potential beginner, gently guiding him towards to goal of making better photos along the way.

The LCD screen on the back is a huge step forward from previous models, as it allowed to effortless pre-screen the shots taken. I was even carrying a laptop computer to better inspect the initial images, but after a short while we only resorted the the built-in screen.

The biggest surprise was however the image quality after we analyzed our initial >350 photos on a large monitor. The yield of usable photos was right out of the box very high, which reiterates the ease of use of this camera and the great auto-focus system (despite only 11 sensors). Also the smallish size of the body turned out to be less problematic, even with a bigger lens attached to it.

We found the image quality obtained to be absolutely stunning, the sharpness of the images was ""picture perfect"". Colors just the way one would expect them, as is the hall mark of any Nikon camera. Even small birds could be cropped from the 24 MP resulting in usable 7 MP images. Post-processing was a thrill and resulted in a substantial number of images clearly qualifying as publication quality.

Having seen both, the best and the worst in Nikon cameras, I can verify that this entry level DSLR is a keeper. Even though never planned, it will stay in the collection as a second body and now serves as the main camera until the D800 arrives.

If an entry level camera already is this good, what may be expected of the upcoming updates of the other DX models, the likes of D5100, D7000 and the D300s?",05-12-2012,05-12-2012

This review is for those SLR beginners like myself. I have never had the money to spend on a digital SLR but since now we have twin boys at home and D3200 finally came out I felt justified to spend the extra bucks. Specially after being disappointed by and returning the Canon S100.

I have had the D3200 for 5 days now and even though I have not had the chance to take it outside that much, here are my impressions:
1. Pictures are amazingly crisp and true to the color, simply beautiful
2. FPS is fast and satisfying (although, with flash, not always fast enough for two 14 month old boys!). Now I find myself capturing motions that I could have never done before (compare to S100 of course)
3. Takes Amazing videos with great sound
4. Love the view finder, specially, since in this camera it's smarter and more detailed/informative than most LCDs
5. The manual booklet is a good start for someone like me, but you will have to do additional research and playing around to understand all the available options in the Menu
6. The Modes are quite useful once you understand them
7. The LCD screen is so well pixilated that you can see the quality of your pictures right there and then
8. The camera is the perfect size (specially if you're on the move and have your hands full already like me), light wight and grips well
9. Battery is still on the original charge after about 200 pics and 10 videos

Finally, I ordered the Wifi module last week but seems like Amazon is not going to get it anytime soon! I can't wait to try this functionality with my android. I will update the review once I get that but overall we love the Camera as is.

===================================================

Update 6/24/12 WMAU review

After waiting for 2 months on Amazon I finally got the WU wireless module from somewhere else by paying an extra $25 and cancelling my order on Amazon.

The module is pretty useful. Super small and comes with a cool case that attaches to your camera strap. Connects via WiFi to your phone (Android for now) and the associated wmau App (Wireless Mobile Adapter Utility) gives you the following 4 functionalities once you are connected Remotely:
1. Use the Camera to take pictures that will be downloaded and to your phone instantly. Take about a sec per pic.
2. Use the phone to take the pictures. can see the camera view live. Only provides the shutter options but it could come handy for taking family pictures on a tripod.
2. Downloads the pictures (temporary memory) for viewing on your phone in seconds. I had about 200 pics that were downloaded in about three seconds. From there you view and select the files that you actually want to download to your phone. Every time you close the app the temp pics will go away. You can select a picture or multiple pictures to download permanently to your phone.
4. You can ""share"" the downloaded photos. The share option gives you all the usual suspects, Facebook, Gmail, etc.

I like the last two option as I am betting all my techie friends on Facebook are wondering how I posted a family picture via mobile with this quality! :) Little secret iphone10!

Also, overall now that I have taken over 2000 pictures and 20 videos with D3200 all I can say to convey the quality of pictures, ease of use, speed, and other utilities made available in this camera are WOW and Love it! Money well spent and kudos to Nikon.",05-11-2012,05-11-2012

Don't need AF performance for that, nor high ISO's, but do need great resolution. So, with trepidation and reserve, I decided to try this one. I am coming from D700's, D3's, D7k's and other as my point of reference. I shoot for a living.

The good:

Resolution is excellent, especially when coupled with the 40mm macro from Nikon. I have shot a few hundred shots now and am very happy in that regard. The menus are simple enough that you can work them out if you already know Nikon's systems for menus. AF performance is great for this kind of body. Using my 17-55 with it, I could acquire focus only slightly slower that with the D7000. I tried in lower light to see how that worked, and while you could tell it was slower, it was not too bad. Every shot I have taken bar one (black dog in a dark room), was in focus as intended. So, AF is good for this kind of body. I like the layout of the controls too, everything was where it was expected to be.

The bad:

Small body means uncomfortable grip. However, that is what was expected, so I don't really think this is a ""bad"" for this camera. I expect a person with smaller hands will thoroughly enjoy that aspect. Lenses (all but smaller ones) are front heavy and fell off balance. Pop a 70-200 VR on this and it is silly unless you carry/hold it by the lens primarily. Lastly, there is no AF fine tune, but.... I have not found the need on even one of the lenses I will use it with to make any adjustments, so not too bad a thing.

Conclusion:

Get one if you want it for landscape, low speed portraits (esp families) or for product/architecture. I highly recommend it.",05-10-2012,05-10-2012

Naturally, I got the red one. The lens it comes with is adequate and will suit the needs of the average beginner, but by no means should the 18-55mm be your go-to. Invest in your glass. Bodies will inevitably be replaced, but your glass is forever. I recommend your grab a solid zoom lens before you do a prime lens. Anyway, the D3200 offers what you'd expect from a DSLR: manual mode, portrait mode, sport mode, point-and-shoot mode, continuous shooting (4FPS), timer-based shooting, etc.

A couple draw backs would be its mediocre low-light performance and acceptable-grade processing even with high-performance SD cards. I would refrain from using th is camera during fast-paced and.or dark shooting situations seeing as it isn't quite there in performance. Though I love my D3200, I recently replaced it with a far better camera for this reason and the work load I have taken. But make no mistake. This camera is my workhorse. Or beater. The pictures below were all taken with my D3200 (and adjusted in Lightroom). If you're seeking a newer entry-level DSLR definitely give the D3400 a look.",05-22-2018,05-22-2018

Can’t speak for longevity since I’ve only had them a few weeks but I have other TOZO Bluetooth headphones that are still going strong so I’m confident that these will too.Now the details…My main purpose for buying these were for use at the gym, which they work great. I’m someone who likes my music pretty loud, especially while working out, and the volume on these can get there while still sounding clear - even when battling the loudness from a really busy gym. Even though I saw the features for noise cancellation and microphone prior to buying, they again weren’t the real purpose I bought them. However, I’ve been so impressed with both of these features as well, especially the noise cancellation capabilities, so I’m getting a lot more use than I expected out of these.As someone whose cell phone lives on low battery, I’m terrible about charging any & all electronics so I appreciate the battery life for these headphones so far. Can’t speak for how long it takes to fully charge since I left it to charge overnight, but I’ve had these for a few weeks and have only had to charge them once.The look of these is way more expensive than they actually are. The monochromatic matte khaki color is perfect. I don’t always trust the pictures and was concerned it might be too yellow but it’s definitely not at all. It’s true-to-color when compared to the listing photos. (Side note to TOZO, please release a dark brown version of these)For comfort, I do have pretty small ears but these fully cover my ear so the cushion part is not sitting on top of my ear but instead around it - which really makes them a lot more comfortable for me. I haven’t had to wear them for longer than an hour consecutively but have had no issue with comfort during that time.",02-03-2024,02-03-2024

Even so, the following comments are without bias.Build: The phones appear to be well built. The headband adjusts with a clicks that feel solid yet unforced. They sport a sleek and clean look.Comfortability: My previous set of headphones were Logitech H600s. Compared to those, the TOZO unit is larger and heavier. However, the fit is much better and the larger earpads make for a vastly superior feel. I have a smaller head, and the phones fit snuggly, which I like. I'm not sure how comfortable they would be on a larger dome.Sound quality: I am not an audiophile, but I do enjoy good sound quality. If there is anything that bugs me, it's tinny sound. These phone do not suffer from that malady. The bass is warm and solid and the highs are crystal. The sound is several factors better than the H600 headset. In this area, these phones far outperformed my expectations.Microphone: The phones have a built-in microphone that is adequate for communication, but not for professional recording. Audio from the mic sounds a bit like you're in a cave. To be honest, not much can be expected from a mic in any headphone, however.Latency: There is absolutely no noticeable latency in these phones. I am beyond impressed.Noise Canceling / App: I was completely surprised when I discovered the TOZO app and linked them up to the phones. The app provides six noise-canceling modes that work beautifully. I have dogs that bark from time to time and I can clearly tell when their racket is being canceled out. Change the mode and ambient sound is mixed in with my content. Further, once the device is added to the app, you can change modes even when the phones are paired to a different device. Simply brilliant.Other notes: I have not used the headphones long enough to drain the battery yet, so I have no real data on how long a single charge lasts. I have listened for over four hours, however, and had more than 50% charge left at that point. Also, I have only had these for a little more than a week. Sometimes the performance and durability of electronic devices degrades over time. I plan to update the review after several months of use.Overall value: The purchase price of $39 is right in the range of similar headphones on Amazon.

The price is right for the overall quality, design, battery life and more. It seems with Tozo you can expect to get top notch technology at affordable and reasonable pricing. A high value set of headphones that competes, spec wise, with significantly more expensive headphones. The nice thing about over the ear headphones like these is the overall sound field is much more immersive. There tends to be a broader range and richness to the sound that is much harder to expect from earbuds. This probably has a lot to do with the much larger diameter speaker drivers.Battery life appears to be really good thus far.The headphones do collapse which makes them easier for packing and travel. Though they're still much more bulky than earbuds.Some negatives with these headphones. The ANC (noise cancelling) feature is weak compared to earbuds I have with ANC. So poor that there's almost no distinguishable difference when it's on or off. There's also a pass through feature which allows you to hear external noise (which is very helpful in conversations). That works much better than the ANC feature.Overall, these are a great value for the price with excellent, rich sound.",02-05-2024,02-05-2024

Great value and excellent performance so far,"Full disclosure: I received a very large discount for these from TOZO.I have tested several TOZO products in the past. The quality has steadily been improving for their products. I am comparing these with my Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones, which I consider the top of the line benchmark. I have owned the Bose QC before and Sony takes the prize. While the Sony XM5's beat out the TOZO HT2s, it is not by a huge margin as many would think. Given that the TOZO headphones are just $49.99, this is a huge value.Sound: The HT2s come very close to replicating the sound of the XM5s. Tozo has an app that allows you to adjust the equalizer like Sony. There are a bunch of preset settings, butthe equalizer allows you to adjust the settings based on what you like the most and based on what types of music you listen to. For reference, I am streaming on a Samsung S21 Ultra with LDAC enabled and streaming Dolby Atmos quality songs from Amazon Music.Noise cancelling: The way the XM5s fit around the ear does a little better job than the HT2s, but it is not by a large margin. The transparency mode for the HT2s is also very clear. Full disclosure, I have not yet tested these for phone calls. But given the accurate transparent mode, they will probably sound great for phone calls, like the XM5s.Comfort: The XM5s still have a significant leg up in terms of comfort. While you could probably wear the XM5s for 3-4 hours with no discomfort, the HT2s could probably go for 1-2 hours. This is still fantastic for $50 headphones. If you're watching a movie on a plane, I'm sure you could go for 2-3 hours and not notice much discomfort. But if you want to use noise-cancelling and sleep, you may notice it more. The HT2s just feel a little bit too snug. But they are also probably less likely to fall off.The HT2s don't come with a case, but at $50 this is still a good value. The battery seems to last a very long time. The Bluetooth connection seems just as good as on the XM5s.Summary: TOZO reminds me of how far KIA cars have come relative to Toyota from 2005 until now. The HT2s are legitimate contenders in the over the ear headphones space that we should take seriously, especially at $50.",01-13-2024,01-13-2024

But there are times that you want to really shut out the ambient sound and be immersed in youraudio.The H2 fills this bill nicely at a price much lower than you would pay for this level of quality build and performance.When you put them on and hold the top button for a few seconds you will get a chime letting you know they're on.This same top button will serve to pause or resume the music,answer a phone call,or turn off the power.Leave them on as long as you like with no discomfort or irritation.The noise cancelling is one of the best features.I use them while riding my indoor bike and they actually do cancel out almost all of the sound of the chain and wheel spinning.Battery lasts all day if need be and is charged via Type C cable,included in the box of course.No problem with Bluetooth connecting which is instantaneousbut there's also a place to plug in a 3.5 cable if you are listening to a device that doesn't have Bluetooth.One more thing:Download the Tozo app to your phone and use it to customize the bass/treble functions to customize the sound of your favorite music.I don't think you can beat the H2 at even a much higher price;at this price they are truly a superior value.",02-04-2024,02-04-2024

At the time I got them, they were $50 with a $10 off coupon, so I figured I’d give them a try since I’ve had prior experience with Tozo products—specifically, the T10 Bluetooth earbuds. If you’re curious, I still use the T10 earbuds everyday for running, working out, and walking my dog. But as expected, the HT2 is another fantastic product made by Tozo.I’ve had these headphones for exactly a week now and can say that I am more than impressed by their quality! The first thing that you will notice is the packaging. It is very sleek and modern. Inside the box, you’ll find the headphones, a quick instructions guide, a slightly more in-depth instructional pamphlet, some promotional material for their App and warranty, a ~2-foot USB-C cable, and a ~3-4 foot aux cable with 1/8th inch ends. The HT2 feels like it is made of pretty good quality plastic. The speakers are marked “L” and “R” for easy identification and are surrounded by comfy foam. The right speaker has four buttons, including the power button, a connected + and – button for controlling the volume (I’m counting these as two separate buttons), and a noise-canceling (NC) button.Holding the power button for about three seconds will turn the headphones on/off. Syncing the headphones was incredibly fast and easy. In mere seconds, I was listening to music. I ended up downloading the Tozo App, which allows you to play with the settings so you can customize things like the bass, mid-tones, and treble.The first time messing with the settings, I couldn’t tell if it was affecting the sound. Turns out, I had to update it. Here is one of the few cons of the HT2, updating the headphones through the App took about 10 minutes, which is fine. However, upon clicking on the “Update” tab, it doesn’t give you a warning pop-up or anything, it just starts updating, and during that time, you have to keep the headphones and phone powered on. The App says not to exit from it while it is updating either, so for about 10 minutes, I had to stare at a loading screen while worrying about whether my phone would go into sleep mode if I wasn’t constantly tapping at it. However, since the update, the headphones respond to the customization settings. Speaking of which, the customization settings are pretty in-depth and have about 10 points where you can articulate to your preference. I typically just use the default settings, but I can see people getting into it and editing their settings for specific types of music. But let’s get into the HT2’s sound quality and use case scenarios!The HT2 has great mid and treble tones but seems to be lacking in bass. That being said, I think the sound quality is truly outstanding. I listen to an eclectic range of music and found these headphones doing each genre justice. You can pick out and hear every instrument of a song, and vocals are crisp. These headphones are also good for podcasts as well. I’ve probably put around 25 hours of listening time with these and haven’t noticed anything weird regarding crackling, noise interference, disconnects, etc. I’ve also only charged these twice; the battery is pretty incredible, though I’d imagine it will degrade over time. Currently though, pretty good. The range is also good. I can go anywhere within my apartment (not big, about 850 square feet) and stay connected, even with doors closed/in other rooms. The Noise-Canceling function is pretty good, though it won’t block out loud noises completely, just muffles them. That being said, it made functions like vacuuming and using my food processor less noisy (for me at least lol). I did find them capable of blocking out moderate noises, such as office banter at work. The Noise-Canceling button switches from Noise-Canceling (default), to off, to something called “Pass Through” which I’m not entirely sure what it does, but it seems like it allows noise from outside to be hearable, whereas turning the NC off just seems like you have earmuffs on and can dully hear noise from outside. Since I am on the subject of the Noise-Canceling function for these headphones, I will say that the button placement is kind of weird. When looking at the right speaker head-on, the NC button is at around the 4 o’clock position. The first few times taking the headphones off, I found myself accidentally pressing the button. Eventually, I changed the placement of my fingers when taking them off to avoid this. However, the NC button is very sensitive and doesn’t take much force to activate/change the setting. For example, just taking off the headphones and laying it on a flat surface will often press the button in. This can be jarring when putting the headphones back on after having them off briefly, but not long enough to warrant shutting them off completely. Another minor con I found with these headphones is that they suffer from sound leakage/bleeding. This means that when in use, whatever you’re listening to can be heard from outside. Apparently, this is common for overhead headphones (not earbuds), so that’s why I find this to be a minor issue. That being said, if you work with others in a quiet setting, you might want to either listen at a lower volume or use other headphones/earbuds.So besides listening to music/podcasts/stuff, what else can these things do? Although I’ve only had them for a week, I was able to do some unconventional testing. These headphones act as a headset and have a built-in mic. Turns out, the mic works pretty well. I didn’t use these to make a phonecall, but I tested them by syncing to my laptop to do video meetings for work. I didn’t hear any mentions of them sounding bad or cutting out. The audio from meetings was good too, no echoing, or disturbances that you may get with lesser-quality headsets.Another thing that I tried with these (though I don’t recommend) is audio editing. I used these to edit some sound files through Adobe Audition 2024 and noticed a lot of latency. Granted, this is a problem that affects most Bluetooth headsets. That being said, since these headphones come with an Aux and USB-C cable, I’m sure I could have used either to connect directly to my computer and eliminate that latency.Something cool I decided to do with these headphones is to use the Aux cable to jack into a quarter (¼) inch adapter and into my old Line 6 Spider IV 15-watt practice amp. Turns out, it actually worked! The sound wasn’t that great, but I only spent about five minutes messing around. I was more curious to see if it would work. I’m sure if I put in some time, I could have made it sound better though. Maybe something worth updating on later.One thing that I haven’t been able to do with these (that will also warrant touching upon in a later update) is using these for gaming. The reason being is that I have a PS5 and apparently it requires an adapter/dongle to use Bluetooth devices.To wrap things up, the Tozo HT2 headphones are surprisingly high-quality for a low cost. The sound quality is excellent, though it lacks heavy bass—if that is important to you. The battery life is also really good. Though I didn’t touch upon it, wearing these headphones for longer periods is pretty comfortable. Typically, I find headphones to squeeze/hurt my ears after about an hour, but I’ve been able to keep these on for around four hours before I felt I needed to take them off. The Aux and USB-C cables allow you to directly connect to sources, allowing for flexibility and opening new doors for using these headphones. Though these headphones have some minor drawbacks (NC button sensitivity, weird/long App/headphone updating process, and sound leakage/bleeding), the overall value you get from the HT2s is more than worth the price.12/30/23 - UpdateI used the AUX cable to connect the headphones directly to my PS5 controller and they work great! Especially nice when my downstairs neighbor's dogs are barking nonstop. With that being said, I don't play multiplayer games, so I can't tell you how well the microphone works online or if it defaults to the microphone built into the controller.",12-09-2023,12-09-2023

They weight only 8 ounces (Cowin weighs 9 oz, which is 12% heavier, which makes a big difference when you're wearing them for an extended period of time such as watching a movie)2. The ear padding and head pad are really soft and comfortable--nicer than my Cowin set.3. The ANC (noise-cancelling) is very good and comfortable. What I like about the TOZO (both these headphones and the earbuds) is that when ANC is on and I'm not listening to anything (it's quiet) I do NOT get a nauseous feeling--especially when I turn my head.With my Cowin and most other ANC headphones I have tried, I get a queasy feeling when I turn the ANC on and have no audio playing and it gets worse when I turn my head--a bit like vertigo.So, these TOZO's are a vast improvement for me not to have that vertigo/nausea!4. They talk to you.The headphones have a pleasant voice and tones that tell you what you're doing with the controls and connecting up on Bluetooth.It plays a tone when you turn them on or off.It makes another tone when it's looking for a Bluetooth source to connect to. It makes a 3rd tone when it connects and syncs with a device, and then sound starts playing (if the device is playing audio).It tells you what ANC mode you are in:""ANC On"", ""ANC Off"", ""Pass Through""(Pass Through mode is where the headphones slightly amplify the sound on the external microphone to make it almost like you're not wearing the headphones).That said, I think I like how the earbuds work better than the headphones in this regard, as the earbuds say ""Power On/Off"", ""Pairing"", and ""Connected"" instead of using tones, so it's easier to understand what the earbuds are doing.5. The controls are straightforward.There is an on/off button (with a raised ""O"" on it for ease of finding it with your fingers without having to take the headphones off and look at the buttons to see what they do), volume control (with a raised ""+"" and recessed ""-"" where the ""+"" is on the upper side of that button and the ""-"" is on the lower side of the button--versus the Cowin where the volume up button was on the lower side of the button and the volume down button was on the upper side of the button), and a button for cycling through the ANC modes.6. A big complaint I have had with headphones for decades was having to figure out which side was left and right. All of them had a tiny L or R located somewhere on each earpiece, but they were ALL difficult to see because they were always small and were the same color as the earpiece--and especially hard to see the L or R in low lighting.These TOZO have a *large* L and R inside each earpiece making it really easy to know which side is which.See the attached picture.There is also the standard tiny L and R on the hinge point for each earpiece, both those are also difficult to see and thus not as useful as the large L and R inside the earpieces.7. I like how the headphones fold up pretty flat and are not as bulky to store as those headphones that don't fold up.See the attached picture.8. The sound is good. I've watched a few movies and TV shows and the stereo separation is very good, the sound is clean and crisp.9. The ANC works well in damping out exterior sounds, and it is easy to tell the difference between the 3 ANC modes with these headphones.I also tried using these headphones to make a call on my cellphone.It worked okay but not great. The audio on the call was good, but I was told by my callee that the microphone pickup was staticky and somewhat weak and I made the call from inside the house with no other noise.Also, it just 'felt' weird listening to myself when I spoke as it felt to me like my voice was a bit disembodied.So, while we could do the call, it seems the earbuds are a better choice for making calls than the headphones. This is a really minor nit to pick, since I can't really imagine people would be walking around making calls with these headphones on anyway.My experience with TOZO support has been very good--certainly superior to most other companies.They respond to queries quickly and clearly.They are interested in addressing your concerns and making you a happy (and hopefully repeat) customer.",02-02-2024,02-02-2024

I was going to repurchase those earbuds but I did know I also wanted headphones since my earbuds tend to fall out when I go hard in the gym. I saw the reviews and decided ok I’ll give it a try.First off, as soon as I put these on the noise cancelling is really no joke, it’s wild. I couldn’t hear anything and it was great. The headphones itself was comfortable. It wasn’t too hard on my head and the cushion support on my ears are the best parts.Second, in the video I am using max volume so you can hear the music leakage from the headphones. I do listen to different genres of music, from jazz to edm, hip hop to r&b, acoustic to pop, so I put on many different songs and the bass is really good. Although I’m not surprised because I loved there tozo earbuds I had for nearly a year until I washed it :,(. For the price this is really nice. The only reason I can’t give it 5 stars is because I’m not a fan of music leakage. I love the color and everything about this product. I do know that it only happens when you listen at max volume and when I tested lowering maybe 3 bars on my iPhone, the music leak isn’t that bad and it’s really faint which is what another reviewer said so yeah if you listen at max that’s when you’ll get louder leak.UPDATE:After having this pair for a couple of weeks now, I will be returning them. At the gym, I took off my headphones to see if the noise leaking will be heard by others, I didn’t actually hear the leak; I even turned up the volume on the pair and held the headphones up to hear closer. Still noticing. Keep in mind my gym also plays music. The main reason I will be returning them is because while I was working out, they kept sliding off. I never adjusted it. As you can see the headphones sit perfectly fine on my head but it’s too big around my ears causing them to slide off with extensive movement.The cushion is comfortable and the color is really cute although it’s not worth it in my option to keep headphones that are too big and constantly move or slide off with extensive movement.I will be returning them unfortunately",01-05-2024,01-05-2024

Humans dont have heads this size.,"I'm mid sized with an average horse/elongated head. Which means my head is slightly larger than a person at the 50/50 mark of human sizing. the ear cups hang a little low day 1 so I overlooked that cause they were tight an slightly louder than other headsets an the quality of sound isn't distorting . They were tight enough to stay on the first day I went to the gym; even hitting heavy bags which usually things fly off my head across the room unless I secure them with a band. But this is day 2 at the gym an i can tell they are already looser an im not so sure about doing stretches or leaning my head any direction except straight up or they'll probably fall off.Definitely designed as that ""one size fits all"" Walmart/american sizing for 300lb people. Factoring in a name like ""TOZO"" I kinda expected human sized items. Like I buy china clothing cause it fits humans not whales. But I've rarely had a headset that fits this bad on the lowest setting. It's so tight tho it stays on an Amazon returns are pure israel trash so it costs money to do that these days an you get stuck with their junk.If you don't need them to do anything but eat potato chips an lay down in bed they may work. Even then unless you've eaten enough potato chips they will end up falling off your head while laying in bed. For 40 an a normal person probably works as well or better as anything they got under the tree on Christmas from a family member just trying to buy them junk to get it over with. I've owned mostly studio gear the last 10-30 years of my life. An none of the high end stuff fit this bad.I give it a week an im back to where I was with my other headsets having to use a headband to keep them on an just never using them cause it's loosing up fast.If you want quality you have to order items from China direct in the 2020. Bet hey 40x is only 10 bags of potatoes chips so to a lot of pinnochios here whos npc backstory is thry slave all day to collect money it's not a lot.",01-15-2024,01-15-2024

It's been 3 days and so far the battery is still 100% which is great. The main purpose for these was for my bus rides to and from work. Normally I sit somewhere in the middle of the bus and they've been great but today I sat further towards the back and the shaking of the bus is causing a sort of response with them where they sound like there's something shaking in them and it causes it to sound like it's cutting out with every shake of the bus. It is very annoying and I will be returning them to save up for something with better quality.,01-29-2024,01-29-2024

Before, I was looking for an alternative to AirPods Pro and I found the TOZO NC2s and was very satisfied with them. The only con was a little white noise in transparency mode, which I quickly got used to anyway. Then I saw that they had these over-the-ear HT2s and figured I'd give them a shot. At the price, they are unmatched. There's improvement all around, including Transparency mode. It's just different because you do have something covering your whole ear. It's just something different to get used to. I enjoy that there are multiple noise cancelling modes, that the app is pretty robust, that there are OTA updates that can continually improve these headphones, and how comfortable/light they are. The only con I can see right now is that Transparency mode cannot be gotten to through the physical buttons. You have to be in the app. However, this is likely something that can come with an update, so hopefully that's coming in the future. I'm still giving these 5 stars because these headphones are just impressive overall. If they release newer ones, I'll probably be in line to get them and enjoy them.Edit: I paired these to my Steam Deck and other non-mobile devices and noticed pretty bad latency. After changing to other compatible codec profiles, the latency did not improve. These headphones are still quite good, though I believe these are for the casual user that wants them for one device. It’s disappointing that they have multipoint capability, but you’ll experience different latency as there appears to be limited codec support. I’ll be on the hunt for different headphones that better suit my needs, but these are still good headphones. Just proceed with caution and make a more informed decision where you can.",12-22-2023,12-22-2023

When NC is on, damn, EVERYTHING gets blocked out, except voices which are transmitted clearer than if you didn't have them on, which is crazy to me, makes me wonder if I have auditory problems.

The TOZO HT2 headphones hit all expectations for high quality build, great sound and comfortable.The bass hits and the highs are crisp and clean. TheTOZO HT2 allow me to get lost in my music hearing details I had missed on lesser quality headphones or my phone speakers. Truely excellent!The TOZO HT2 is easily the most comfortable headphones I have used. They hug my head without being tight or hurting my ears. These can be worn for hours without any discomfort.The build seems very solid and I feel these will hold up well, though time is always the judge on that. As you can see from my photos they fold down flat and the hinges that permit that seem sturdy. Very convenient!The active noise canceling works well and you may bounce through the modes with the push of a physical button on the headphones.Lastly, I turned up my music to the loudest I would want to listen and stood right beside my wife and she could not hear the music at all. This will allow me to use these anytime without disturbing anyone else, which is a must and these nail it.Very easy to connect and use right out of the box and a seriously GREAT pair of headphones!

Pictured are the Tozo HT2 and Skullcandy HESH, the HESH run around $135.The Tozo's are a bit heavier, but have ANC and you can definitely tell, even when I turn the ANC off the Tozo's are still more quiet than the HESH.Both sound equally good but seeing that the HT2 are 75% less in cost than the HESH that's super impressive. With the Tozo app you can customize the sound more, Skullcandy doesn't have an app.These are gym headphones I'm not trying to get the same sounds as I would out of some Bose headphones, not trying to sweat up $300+ headphones. Speaking of sweating the Tozo do get your ears pretty warm I'm sure it has to do with the tighter seal for ANC.For the price HT2 are DEFINITELY worth it. I feel safe to say that any headphones around $150 the HT2 will be just as good or better. I have several Tozo earbuds and have handed them down to my kids after getting these HT2. Totally worth it.UPDATE.I wore them to the gym last night, again great sound I couldn't hear any except my music with ANC on. They do shift on my head when lying down on the bench, they aren't as tight on my head as the HESH, so the band falls towards the bench and the music quality suffers, but that's to be expected. If they had a way to adjust the width tightness that would be the only improvement I can see with these headphones. Still a solid buy IMHO at $49.99.",11-27-2023,11-27-2023

The equalizer app is user-friendly and allows me to tailor the audio profile to match my mood or the type of content I'm enjoying.The build quality of the headphones is also worth mentioning.

Like I said it's very clean and even. But not so much as far sound with bottom bass. However I didn't play with the phone app equalizer so maybe there are adjustments.

I spent a lot of time customizing them in real time for different types of music I usually listen to and managed to generate a single EQ profile that suits all of those genres. All is left is to listen and enjoy. Buying a case for these is likely needed in order to keep them protected, along with the enclosed cables.",01-14-2024,01-14-2024

The Tozo HT2's continue the legacy of offering a well-designed, high-performing product for a very reasonable price. The sound quality I believe is on par with the ""Gold"" ear buds which is to say very good. The ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) modes work well and there are more options available if you use the Tozo app. One small gripe is the Tozo app can have troubles connecting to the headphones and I have had similar issues connecting to the Tozo bluetooth speakers and ear buds as well. But once connected there are a lot of options available for equalizer (including fully custom), and ANC on products equipped with that feature (including the HT2s). Back to the HT2s, the battery life is incredible. I used mine on a 4.5 hour flight at high volume and the battery only dropped by 20% over that time...impressive indeed. The muff design of the headphones is very comfortable and soft and is a sort of faux-leather material. I have relatively large earlobes and the muffs are big enough to cover fully outside of the lobe which is important for long-wear comfort. The controls are all on the right side muff (and the headphones are clearly labeled ""L"" and ""R"" inside of the muffs on the speaker covers). It does take a bit of getting used to feeling where the buttons are and which one does what but not bad. My only suggestion here would be to move the volume out to a spinning dial on the perimeter of the outside of the speaker body rather than having the small buttons for volume. Then the small buttons could be used solely for track advancing or reversing, skipping etc. Overall I give the headphones a 4.8/5...performance-wise they are essentially perfect, and a couple of tiny design and connectivity tweaks would bring it to a 5. I love them!",01-12-2024,01-12-2024

Noise cancelling feature seems to work in an electronic way as it can be cancelled, this may be helpful if you don't want to get too lost in your music. I like the intuitive design to include the button placement and easy visual Left and Right ear cup labeling, makes them quick to put on correctly.

Product Is pretty muchas advertised,"It came Sunday at 4pm and I've been using it immediately after it came and I've been using since then, yesterday and today even while writing this review. It came charged with 92% battery( I saw it on the tozo app). I started using it as soon as it came for about 3 hours while doing laundry with noise cancelation on and it actually worked. After laundry yesterday, I was chilling streaming music for about 4 to 5 hours, went to the store, took a walk, was playing football with it on and watched my show with it. Today I've been using it all day and to cut this short, it's 43% while writing this review. It's advertised to be 60 hours with ANC off and 40 hours with ANC on, so it's safe to say the battery life is decent since I've been using it with ANC on right? Remember I've been using it all day 😂. Its actually 1am right now so it's the third day, using it without charge. Anyways the feel and comfort is valid. Very comfortable and light weight as described. Other headphones usually leave me with some kind of pain on my ear while and after using them but this doesn't 👌🏾.The app comes in handy and I'm surprised it actually works and syncs well with the headphones... like it actually works.All modes works fine as described. Overall I'm impressed by the quality and features of it for $40 (well at least at the time I bought it. Highly recommend them 👌🏾",02-13-2024,02-13-2024

I work out 3 times a day and really need a pair that doesn’t bother me. These ones seem to do the trick! The ear pad indents are big enough for my whole ear and earrings to fit in. They are adjustable so you can make them longer if needed, but at the shortest they’re perfect for me. They fit well by themselves or over a beanie if I’m out walking. You can rotate the ears to adjust for a flush fit.The only downsides to them are when I put them on/take them off or adjust at all, sometimes I hit a control button on them. They also don’t have amazing noise canceling like my beats do, but I’d rather they fit my head and not hurt than completely mute other noises.

I like that they are USB-C rechargeable, as I have plenty of those cables plugged in all around the house and at work. They connect easily right out of the box. The noice cancellation is almost too good. I was using them at work and engulfed in my computer. My co-worker was standing in the doorway way yelling to get my attention and I was totally oblivious. Fortunately you can easily toggle that feature off. Finally, the 3.5 mm jack is an unbelievably useful feature I’d have never realized I needed but now can’t live without. You can easily convert these bluetooth headphones to wired with the included cable. Long story short, these headphones rock, and if you’re still reading this just buy them already.",12-17-2023,12-17-2023

I did download the app and have messed with the EQ and active NC modes. It doesn't drown out sound 100% but it does block out MOST sound. I am not a audio buff but I do listen to a lot of music and like how these sound. I think they're fine for the average listener.The material is light - feels a little flimsy but it's expected for the price point. Visually they are not bad! I chose the tan color. The cups are soft and squishy.I'll update this review if there is any trouble but this isn't my first TOZO product.

This is just another slam dunk by Tozo. Love these headphones. Comfort is top notch, sound is amazing (bass is a tiny bit low for my liking but the App in +bass mode fixes this) the active noise cancelation works really really well BUT for me the thing that makes these an absolute winner (aside from the very reasonable price point if you get them when they are on sale) is the transparency mode. I've got a job and a family that I need to be able to still hear when someone needs me which the transparency mode allows me to hear them when they are trying to talk to me or get my attention. I can wear the headphone and even pause my music and have full conversations as if they weren't even there.",01-02-2024,01-02-2024

I've had the Tozo T10 for 5 years and it is still going strong.The headphones I previously had broke so I was in the market for a new one. I had first purchased the Beats Solo 3, but had to return it due to how uncomfortable it is. It doesn't go around your ears, instead it presses against it. I also wear glasses so it pressed so hard against my ears, giving me headaches.So I was back in the marker until I came across the HT2! Obviously I've owned a very reliable Tozo product in the past, and decided to give this a try. Man I am not disappointed!It is extremely comfortable! Sometimes I forget that I have headphones on.The ANC is on a whole new level. When I accidentally turned it on, I wondered why it was so quiet in my house which it never is until I realized it was on.The sound quality is fantastic! I'm a Bass guy, so I love thr ability to change the EQ. I was excited seeing a Bass+ EQ option. It is amazing. I am hearing sounds in my music that I never heard before.All in all... a wonderful product. My only gripe would be that the HT2 does not come with a Case. My previous headphones always have. It's not a deal breaker though. I can always order one online.",02-03-2024,02-03-2024

Surprised it took them this long to get over the ear headphones.,Once again Tozo takes care of their customers and offers free products once and awhile. I paid for these upfront and will get refunded by Tozo except tax and paypal fees. I only have used over the ear headphones with my PC that requires you to use a usb dongle. The HT2 you can use via bluetooth (primary way) or you can hardwire with wires provided for headphone jacks or through a usb to a computer. I was surprised my computer just starting playing music when I plugged them in via usb. Sound quality and depth is great. I don't know how more expensive headphones perform but these are probably as good as my ears can really perceive. These are my first impressions and need to use them for a bit to see if the battery life and other aspects hold up but they seem well made and good value. The noise cancelling is quite impressive. These beat out my other gaming headset in that regard. The fact they are bluetooth means I can use these more often and looking forward to using them on an airplane. I will still use my T20 headphones for exercise and ease of use. My T6 headphones as backup and for the bedroom. These will be for when I want to be totally immersed.,12-06-2023,12-06-2023

Looking at them, I initially thought they'd be too tight on my head, but the ear cups are incredibly soft and compressed to the point where they fit very well and form a fantastic seal for noise cancellation. Along with the active noise cancelling, I can't hear anything going on around me at all. And when I want to hear people because I'm in a store or talking to someone, and the pass through mode lets me hear clearly without having to take them off.The sound is very crisp, with a really strong bass, which is an area that I think can sometimes come up lacking on wireless headphones. I listen to a very wide array of music, and I've yet to have a song come up on my mix that sounds less than stellar on these headphones.The battery life is incredible, and they fold up well for compact storage, which makes them great for commuting and traveling with.And on top of all of that, it's a small detail but the fact that they have a 3.5mm audio jack and can just be plugged in is really convenient, so I can keep them connected to my phone on bluetooth, and plug them into my laptop to use without having to disconnect and reconnect them.All in all, I cannot recommend these enough.",01-11-2024,01-11-2024

So you may want a Bluetooth adapter in that case.There is also a TOZO app that allows you to configure the sound cancelling and by going deeper in the menu, you can set the equalizer or select a music genre to get different levels of sound adjustment.Overall, I think these are a fabulous value.",01-04-2024,01-04-2024

Noise canceling is the same route you can find better but only at much higher price points. It's actually pretty great on these, although harder to gauge because they are over the ear headphones.

From an “I love bass” perspective, these things blow every other device I’ve got out of the water, and out past the gravitational pull of the planet. What's more amazing than the bass itself, is that the transducers can handle it without turning into a distorted mess. It’s just pure sound pressure.Obviously, though these can be EQ’d to produce a fairly neutral sound, they’d never be my choice if I were looking for that kind of experience. In fact, I’d like to see Tozo release an update that expands the high frequency bands a bit. I like plenty of treble sparkle, and my worn out old ears can just manage it with the EQ adjustments on these.The bottom line is, that if you really love bass, and ever wondered if you could push both eardrums far enough into your skull to have them meet somewhere in the middle, these are for you. They get 5 stars from me, based on how they sound, and for technical achievement. Somehow, this doesn’t seem like it should be possible. Thanks Tozo! I’m sorry - what?",01-03-2024,01-03-2024

I have enjoyed them for several weeks but I was looking for an alternative device to watch TV. I am completely blown away by this device. The best sound quality and noise cancellation of any headphones I’ve ever used. I’m a retired professional classical musician and have been an audiophile my entire life. This headset will become my primary device for listening to music and I’ll use the Bose as an alternative device. And I paid one tenth the price of the Bose which I would return if I could receive a full refund. And I must mention that I purchased this device at a discount from the Amazon warehouse in like new condition for $28 delivered to my door. Wow! Lucky day indeed!,02-12-2024,02-12-2024

But the most annoying aspect is anytime I change the sound modes from ANC/pass through / ANC off there is a women's voice to tell me. I would have much preferred tones of some sort.Overall for the price I paid which was $40, it's a very respectable headphone. It's got decent ANC and good pass through that sounds natural not robotic. The earmuffs are nice and comfy, but my ears did get hot after only 40 minutes. And it's about 60° F at the time, so it was hotter these definitely would have been way hotter on my ears. Overall I think the headband and the size of the cushioning makes these a big headphone not overly big like Sony's, but these feel more premium then Sony's lower end and even maybe Sonys mid range offerings.Sound stage for these was just okay in my book, but then again for the price it's a good option. You definitely need the app to adjust for better sound and has nice extra features to help control and maintain the headphones better.So in the end for the price, look, style, sound, and comfort these are a very solid option for the price.

Just okay. I had to fiddle with the equalizer quite a bit to get them to where I didn't think they sounded both muddy and too sharp (which is bizarre). I'm a music fanatic and am used to Tozo products providing great sound, so I'm a bit disappointed as far as the sound goes.They seem well built, and they would be perfectly comfortable for hours at a time if the ear cups were just a little bit bigger.

Not bad but I question the claim of 60 hours of battery if after only 40 minutes the percentage went down by 4%.I went for a casual walk. t's not hot or humid but the area that covered my ears were very sweaty. I suppose that may be any over-the-ear headphones but I don't like it. I also felt that the headphones were heavy but that's probably just something to get used to.Sound quality is okay at best. I am not a huge audio person but even I could tell the sound just really wasn't that great. You can ""customize"" the sound via the app but it didn't do all that much.

I can walk nearly anywhere on my main floor (which is quite big) without losing connection.Cons:- They're actually just a tiny bit big for me even on the smallest adjustment level. Not a deal breaker.- Battery doesn't seem to last as long as advertised, though it does easily last two or three pretty long work days.- I wish it came with a storage case or bag to keep it safe and dust free when not in use.One tiny gripe about the Android app is that you can't see an actual battery percentage, just a battery logo to tell how much is left.Overall, I'm very happy with these so far, about a month of use on them at this point. Docked the one star due to battery life not being super close to advertised amount. I'll update this later if I run into anything else note worthy.UPDATE: In a recent app update, it now shows battery percent! One less con... Way to go Tozo!",12-27-2023,12-27-2023

The app will let you customize the EQ as well, pick with ANC mode as well as to supply firmware updates which is a nice offering. I have already had a firmware update since opening, would have been nice to know what changed. I am very happy with how the EQ always me to customize the sound, it seems to be limited to just adding 3 profile settings. The ANC works well and offers several levels of strength and also allows you to customize the ANC directly as well.All in all I am very pleased, just being able to truly be able to adjust the EQ to my exact personal requirements is what really made me loves these.

So here are the most important things.Sound: These sound pretty good, they have a lot of bass and the mids are good, I used them to play a lot of punk, metal and hip hop and they really deliver.Noise Cancelation: Ok, so this is where everything's getting interesting. My girlfriend have the Bose Quietconfort 45, so that's my point of comparison. In this Tozo, when you have the NC on you have a good quality of sound, you don't hear a lot of the outside noise so they're pretty cool BUUUT when you turn off the NC the quality of the sound really decrease, it's like all the bass is dead, yes, you can hear the outside world but with the other bose, the quality of the sound didn't decrease, you can only hear a little bit of the outside. So I would recomend to mantain the NC on all the time.Confort: They're really good and nice, I have glasses and always have the problem that the headphones always are unconfortable when I put them on but this is not the case, they're pretty solid.Battery: So far so good, I don't know if i've been using them for more than 60 hours but battery is good.So overall, it's a good set of headphones, pretty solid.

And you do get a liiiittle sound through the headphones on full volume.The mic is good to talk on the phone. I’ve been told I sound clear.However, I don’t really notice much of a sound quality difference between these and my old powerlocus headphones.

It's a minor quibble, but still. This is my second set of headphones (First pair were black), & I'm still experiencing an issue with the in-app battery percentage. After completely charging my first pair the battery level never went above 98%. I went back-and-forth with Tozo tech support: I did a master reset, ensured the firmware was updated, tried different charging cables and adapters - nothing worked.So I returned the first pair with the intention of getting either the Sony WH-CH720N or Soundcore Space Ones. In the end I thought I would give these another try. In white this time. Maybe I would have better luck with a different color?Alas, the same issue. This time after charging for a few hours with the included charging cable I looked at the percentage, & this time it was 97%.Again, it's a minor quibble for the price, but it concerns me because it makes me think these cans have a defective battery and I just bought disposable headphones.

I do many things with my computer that a desktop would not work for me, as I have to move it around frequently and like portability, so I explored into the gaming laptop world. This was a cheaper, yet good option for an entry level Device.Processor- I bought the i7-11800H model and this processor seems to be a bit overkill for even some higher end games. But it’s great to have that extra power to multitask as well. I have not had any issues with the processing power. It’s fast and smooth.Graphics- I’m using the RTX-3050Ti and I’ve seen the card likes to run at 100% nearly all the time when in a game but I have had no issues with its capability of running smoothly and not overheating, and I haven’t even tried any undervolting yet which could improve it more.RAM- the 16gb ram and 4gb vram work well together. I use the heavily graphic related game of BeamNG Drive that requires a lot of RAM to run smooth and have tried several multiplayer games and have never seen the RAM get over 70% (which is pretty good for heavily demanding games). This was Plenty of RAM for the gaming I do to keep it running smooth.Overall- this is a great starting laptop for anyone looking for a gaming laptop or something fast for multitasking. Sure there might be a couple other options with similar price ranges that might perform slightly better. But this one was the lowest price I saw for what you get out of it and it’s been working just fine for me. I haven’t had it long so I may be back to update this if my opinion changes lol. But first impressions were really good.Negatives- the graphics card works really great as mentioned above, but if you use it running at 100% for a couple hours you can completely notice a performance drop because the temperature starts to get too hot. I haven’t had it overheat but I have had some slight performance differences after a while of hard use. That’s really the only “issue”, that’s not a huge deal, that I’ve had. And it’s correctable by changing up some deeper settings.As I have mentioned, this is a great ENTRY Level laptop. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone that is heavily into gaming. It works great for what I want to do with it but it would work pretty bad for a professional gamer (not that pros would ever use a laptop for gaming lol). I am also newer to PC gaming but I’m pretty savvy with computers. So being able to change some settings that the average newer user wouldn’t know how to, without YouTube tutorials, have made this laptop perform a little better than out of the box. But these changes I made so far are all settings included on the computer, not third party software included in this review (meaning anyone can change the basic settings to improve the performance slightly as I have).PS- I thought I had a dead laptop when it came like other reviewers complained about. I read the review of one person that said you have to jam the power plug in there really good til it clicks for it to work. I initially thought I pushed hard enough and heard a light snapping sound, but it wouldn’t charge or turn on. So I pushed a lot harder and heard it click a lot louder and it started charging perfectly fine and started up right away.",01-05-2022,01-05-2022

Returning and eagerly awaiting a second (functional) unit.,"UPDATE (22 March 2022):New unit arrived yesterday and started up perfectly.As for a laptop, it's perfectly functional. The design is nice, the keyboard feels nice (trackpad takes some getting used to clicking), there are enough ports for the peripherals I use, and it's run older games for 5 hours straight with negligible heat. I haven't tested the webcam and microphone yet.I don't play new or graphic-intensive games, but this ran very well on older games (Team Fortress 2, Spec Ops: The Line, Magic the Gathering 2014) and some newer ones (Deep Rock Galactic). I plan to run Halo Infinite and Outer Wilds later this week and expect it to perform well.I will keep this updated as my time with this computer progresses. 5/5___________________________________________________________________OLD REVIEW (20 March 2022):TL;DR - I'm sure the laptop is great but the one I received is defective (can't charge - motherboard issue). I am returning it to Amazon and have ordered another one, as I'm sure a functioning unit will meet my expectations for this product. I will update my review when my second order arrives. As for now, 1 star for defective product.I wanted a budget gaming laptop to replace my retired ASUS G55VW (2011). I chose this model due to its strong specs for a budget device, including an RTX 3050Ti (midrange for graphics cards in 2021 but supports the burgeoning ray-tracing technology used in current games), Core i7 CPU, 1 TB SSD storage, and 16GB memory. I also chose this because I wanted a 17-inch screen. The price point maxed out my acceptable budget range (~$1200).I believe this laptop is a good choice for me considering these specs and the price, and I look forward to trying it out.HOWEVER, the model I received appears to be defective - I believe I got a lemon. Upon unboxing, plugging the charger into the laptop did not illuminate the 'charging' light on the laptop, even after trying different electrical outlets and surge protectors. I took it to a local computer repair shop and the tech confirmed the charger itself was functional, as his voltmeter reported 19+ V. Upon opening the device and testing it, he concluded that something was wrong with the motherboard that prevented charging (I am unfamiliar with computers and cannot relay the significance of what he said).I filed for a return-and-replace with Amazon; they accepted the return but denied the replacement - likely so I couldn't keep both laptops and run. The laptop is currently repackaged and I will drop it off at UPS for a return in the next couple of days.I immediately ordered another unit, as this model was my first choice. I expect the second product to work just fine and meet my purchasing expectations, and eagerly await its arrival. I understand defective products are produced and shipped as a natural part of the production process, and do not consider this representative of Acer.While I'm sure the product will meet my expectations, I am saddened to receive a defective model. I will provide an updated review when my second order arrives.",03-19-2022,03-19-2022

The build quality of the laptop itself was very impressive, very rugged and durable, and the hinges seem like they would last at least 6-7 years.I found that you could lower the fan sound a little by setting the Power profile of your computer to Balanced, and helping it even further along by setting the display to 60 Hz, but it might require you to use Vertical Sync/VSYNC in some games.I was able to run Starfield at 100+ FPS on Low, but the fans were blaring at me the entire time. The fact that it also comes with SATA drive support is also very impressive, because most laptops have completely abandoned SATA support for NVME to save space and for slightly better thermal performance. This computer also has 2 fans for improved thermals (weird fact, I know, but some laptops only have 1), but they also generate twice the noise.Aside from that, this is a very solid entry-level gaming laptop and will be able to run modern games at low-medium settings for at least a few years.",10-20-2023,10-20-2023

If you're considering this laptop my guess is you're like me in that you dont want to build a pc yourself for whatever reason. I would say this was a fair purchase but if you can wait, i'd say save up a bit more and get a pc built for yourself at microcenter or something. I have played many games and all of them can be played on at least medium settings with no lag. That would include cyberpunk 2077 to give you an idea. I really only have one problem with the laptop and it makes it a bad long term investment. From fully charged, i can only game for maybe 50 minutes. Cant even reach an hour.

I use 3D modeling and game engine programs like Unity, 3DsMax, Blender, Photoshop, and Unreal. I also play plenty of MMORGs and Steam games in my (very little) free-time. And I really needed a new work/personal gaming laptop as my last Acer Predator was starting to degrade after several years of constant use. So I decided to try the Nitro since I really liked the Predator and have an Acer monitor as well.So here's my thoughts:DISPLAYThis is something very important to me being an artist. And the colors are accurate and vivid. I don't have any issue editing my art as I switch displays. It can also get quite bright, nothing too eye burning (I keep it on the lower side) and the screen itself is quite large, and visible even from 2 feet away on a desk.PROCESSOR SPEED / RAM / GPUUsing Unity and Unreal, this laptop has been able to handle my beefy VFX work without issue. Same with my of my 3D Modeling and 3D Sculpting work which can be quite demanding on the GPU. Although the RAM is on the low-medium side so I will be looking into getting an additional one so things run a little faster.STORAGEI upgraded on hard-drive storage when it came to this laptop and I'm so glad I have. All those programs I listed above + PC games can take up a lot of space and I have not had an issue needing to delete something in order to do something else.HARDWARE DESIGNIts nice, sleek, and simple. Very similar to the 2018 Predator I have. The keyboard does light up, which I always like but you can not program custom colors (which is no issue for me but good to know). The only other thing is that this is a LARGE laptop. It is larger than my last one and I really like it being this size for the display. It luckily does fit in my laptop bag but I would make sure to measure yours to make sure this will work for you.PRICEBuying a laptop will always be an expense, especially a gaming laptop. But for the storage space, display quality, and RAM, this laptop is a great deal for $1,200.FINAL THOUGHTSIts been 2 months since Ive been using this laptop and I have had a great experience. Gamer or Artist, I would definitely recommend.",02-01-2022,02-01-2022

With the i7-11800H processor and turbo it is fast. One thing that I read in other reviews is to push the power connector until you hear it snap in place. As I was exploring and learning about the machine, I wanted to look at the BIOS. The PDf manual said to push the F2 key when the logo was displayed. Wrong! press and hold the F2 key and then push the power button. Bonus feature - pressing the F2 key at the logo does a fast boot.I have one major complaint with the laptop and that is the red lettering on the black keys, even with back lighting on it is still hard to see some keys. I find it easier to use a seperate keyboard and trackball. My only other issue is Win11. I may at some time go back to Win10 to see an end to cronic updates in a couple of years.

Far faster than my old one (of course) and runs every program to its max. For gaming a 3050 ti is limited to mostly 1080p gaming unless you play some of the lighter games where you can eek out 144op, but you can easily get 120fps on most games with some tweaks with around 70 to 90 fps on larger AAA titles. One of the first things you have to do with any Acer laptop is go into control panel and change the power settings, they come standard with USB and HDD/SSD auto power off which pretty much puts your laptop to sleep whether you change sleep settings or not. Also, press the (N) button by the num pad, click on the gear icon, and click to make the keyboard backlight stay on. I read some reviews online that said the keyboard backlight would turn off automatically, luckily my last laptop was a Acer predator and they have the same settings basically. Fans are almost non existent when just browsing and you can control them (finally) when doing some intense gaming (or using programs like CAD or the like). Also, the power cord is a dual step process, the first click means nothing, you have to push in till you hear a second click. I was looking for a 17"" inch laptop with more than 2 USB A ports, those ports NOT on the right side (mouse interference), could game at atleast 1080p/above 60 fps, a better processor, and had a ethernet port. Sounds like alot but most laptops are 15"" inch with 2 USB A ports and no ethernet ports now. I'm satisfied with this purchase.*Particular Notes: This comes with Norton installed, Firefox, a planet 9 link, and Windows 11. There's a small learning curve with Windows 11 and I hate Norton, but it's easy to uninstall and Windows 11 is whatever. There is no bloatware on this model, I know there is a model that has Alexa but this one doesn't have it. The SSD is pretty fast but not the fastest, it's better than good enough.*",01-21-2022,01-21-2022

It had a defective screen. I sent it to Acer. It took them two days to get my a shipping label. It took seven days for it to reach them. After they had it for a week, they could not give me an ETA on when repairs would be finished. I finally got it back today, on the 25th, and immediately returned it to Amazon because I had to have a functional computer and couldn't hold onto my loaner without a solid estimate for when I'd get this one back.So it was nearly a full four weeks from when I originally got it that it was in my hands in a fully working state, and from what I've seen, this is fast for Acer.Which is a shame - this is a lot of computer for the price. To give credit where it's due, I tested the laptop when it was returned to me and it seemed like the screen problems I was having were completely fixed.Considering the price puts this solidly in the mid-range category, you're getting a lot for what you're paying. It doesn't need an additional harddrive or RAM to be completely viable out of the box. (I bought the 1TB/16GB RAM model.) If you want to add a harddrive, there's a SATA cable in the box, and it's fairly easy to get the back panel off. There's even a tutorial by Acer on YouTube on exactly how to do it.In terms of right-to-repair, though, it's mediocre. It's easy to get to the guts of the computer itself. I'd like having easy access panels for the HDD and RAM, but that's a minor complaint - it's not hard to pry this laptop open.What's disappointing is the mount for the screen. Screens die faster than anything else on a laptop. The way this thing is built, I'm not surprised my screen was defective out of the box. You'll want to always open and close the lid with both hands if you want your screen to last the lifetime of the laptop. If you ever need to change the screen out, it's clearly not designed for you to be able to do so. The bezels aren't as simple to pop open as they are on other units, and the screen is held in place by glue, making it so that you probably want to take it to a technician unless you have some experience doing these kinds of repairs yourself.I wish I could say my experience with this was stellar. I loved my Acer Predator Helios from 2018. I've loved the Aspire I've used for writing documents. I'm just completely unimpressed by Acer's service. Three weeks in and no ETA concerning when the laptop would be back in my hands was unacceptable. They only send you updates when they receive your laptop and when they're sending it back. You can't find out any further details - not even where you're at in the queue.I ended up getting a Lenovo Idea Pad 3 Gaming and so far I am loving it. I can't rate Lenovo's support because I haven't had to contact them. The machine I am using now feels rock solid; much better than I would have expected given the amount of power it has for the price. (Under $800.)With this laptop - it looks like it would be worth it if you get it and it works as intended right out of the box. But - I'm far from the only person who has had an issue with it. They've had build quality problems with the Nitro line all the way through, and there are cases where it took 5-6 weeks for people to get their machines back if they went through Acer's support.With these specs, from the testing I did when I had it hooked up to an external monitor, it performs as beautifully as you'd expect. There is a rock solid machine here if you're careful with the screen and get one that works right out of the box.If you don't?Don't deal with Acer support. Buy a third party warranty if you think you'll ever need it. Buying online, I'd go for something without a lot of reported build problems. This is the kind of laptop that I would buy in person so I could test and immediately replace a defective unit.My trust in Acer is completely shot after this experience. At this point, I'm just glad they got it back to me within the return window. I jumped in because I've had amazing experiences with Acer hardware in the past. Those will probably be my last Acer machines. It's completely unacceptable for a multi-million dollar company to mass produce a line of laptops with a high number of defects and a support process that leaves the buyer in the dark for the majority of it.So - based on build quality, it's a 3 1/2 to 4 star laptop if it works. If it doesn't? You're better off returning it and getting another computer.",02-26-2022,02-26-2022

Acer Nitro had done great in the past for me. The excellent lifetime given by my previous Nitro 5, i5 Gtx1060from 2018. Brought me back with established brand confidence.Then it hurt my feelings with deceptive system write ups, misleading access port specs, ect...The short version.This is a whole lot of all the right components forced to live with each other against their will. This laptop is an uncooperative disappointment.All the gripes:I picked this model specifically for its Thunderbolt 4 USB C Display Adapter Port and was thrilled about the RTX3060 GPU.It took 20 hours of setup (WTF seriously) to find out that besides all the issues that would have made it a defective return anyhow, the Display Port is hard wired to the Intel HD on-board graphics processor. It is built to fail on that point.This system has issues built into it in ways that boggle your bogs. The screen had 7 to 8 light discoloration areas around the edges like it had been beaten on from the inside. The new power cord design is something I hope they have fixed in 2023. My experience was it caused power failures when moved while plugged in.Sudden total power failures, it was like to a blackout.Speaking of feedback, the audio on board sends back slight popping sounds.Digital distortions from all operations and outputs was intermittent; it does seem consistent as reported by other owners of this model. Some speculation whether this is a new WinOS build issue.If you are a VR user just looking to occasionally link to a laptop, find another. It is possible but the performance of theRTX3060 in this systems build is surprisingly dismal. At midrange settings, no ray tracing, CP2077 (Cyberpunk 2077) was not able to hold 15 FPS for any interaction beyond the menu screen. The RTX GPU and the CPU share a studio apt with inadequate airflow. It heats up fast and ""The GPU Little Dual Fans that Could"" can't . Why they even let this build go into manufacture is beyond me. This machine cannot keep baseline operating temperature while watching a Movie. This is actually the first time in 13 years of having a laptop as a critical tool of my trade that I even noticed they had any fans. I always just gave them proper ventilation. You will notice these fans thiugh, when the 95 to 110 degree air starts blasting from all possible routes. This is the GPU warning you that an "" Emergency Safety Shutdown"" is about to occur because you are playing Fortnite or whatever. This was the only helpful unintended feature. I found I had about 15 to 20 seconds to save my game or work. By the time I figured out that workflow hack, I finally admitted to myself that I had been naive and was being stubborn trying to create work arounds and validate the value of my purchase.If you are the kind of person who enjoys taking badly designed hardware platforms and tinkering with them you found a deal here..Cyberware PC, ASUS, NITRO have done well by me for the 3 previous workstations I have built on their bare bones. My 2018 Nitro 5 survived, falls, collisions and was even stepped on (In my bag) and made a cracking noise that brought so many simultaneous gasps in a room full of technicians that you could feel the air leaving the room.So please don't let this lengthy review of this one product turn you away from the brand.

It arrived and my son opened it. He was so excited and then the laptop wouldn't turn on. We thought maybe it needs to be plugged in and charge for a bit. He plugged it in, the charging light came on and it still wouldn't turn on. No sound, no lights, nothing. We waited another couple hours, the orange charging light turned to blue and we tried again.....still nothing. Brand new, straight out of the box and it wouldn't work. I had to then contact customer support and I had to mail this brand new computer to Texas for a technician to work on. Now we have to wait for them to look at it and figure out what is wrong with it and ship it back. So, my experience so far is not great.Update - Finally received the computer back from the technician. It took about 4 days to get there, 3 days for them to fix it, and then 4 to send it back. This was quicker than I expected. There was a cable that wasn't connected right inside, which they fixed. The computer is fast and my son has enjoyed it the last day he has had it. So far, it is a decent computer but who knows what will happen as time goes on. I am giving 3 stars for the aggravation of it not working when we first got it.

(I would have decided to get another Laptop.)The Graphic card and operating system are good but I have never felt as though this pc has unlocked it's full power.The screen is ok; nothing like the OLED but it does fine at Full HD 144hz.The Battery has to be the most disappointing. I made sure everything was up to date before trying to play a League of Legends game on battery power at a cafe one day. I couldn't even get through a game at 4fps. For those who don't know the game can run on just about any pc but a new pc such as this?When the pc is plugged in it runs great. On battery you might as well just surf the web.Ram is good. I wish I got more for my everyday use but 16gb is not bad.The Solid State Drive at 1TB is great. Not just for games loading but to have the free space.Over all this PC is alright. The price I think is fair but defiantly better option for those looking to get a good pc for gaming.The average life of the battery is about an hour running with application. On energy saver maybe add about 30 to 45 mins longer. That's just sad to mebut I'll defiantly be paying attention to this next time around and not the shinny specs.The blue tooth can be spotty. I have a wireless keyboard and mouse. Replaced the batteries because what was happening is a lag from when I was typing to what was showing on the screen. When you use the onboard keyboard and mouse pad it works fine. With Bluetooth devices its spotty. Same with my Bluetooth headset it has issues with connecting. I have to put the device in pairing mode every time because sometimes it says its connected but no sound comes out of the headset.PC is up to date and I hate to give this a low score but these issues keep happening and drive me crazy.Most likely will be buying a different pc and this will become a back up.If your looking for an affordable pc that's $1000 bucks sure go for it but just as I. Don't think your getting the best out of everything with a price like that. Thanks for reading have a good day :)",02-28-2023,02-28-2023

Was using it and logging in just fine for the first week. And then took the laptop somewhere else where I wouldn't be at home or by wi-fi.I didn't realize that when you log in with your PIN it needs wi-fi to let you log in. I found this out the hard way once I was away from the wi-fi.You will get an error saying ""Something and went wrong and your PIN is not available, click here to set up a new pin."" When you go to set up a new PIN it tells you you need Wi-Fi to do so.I wasn't at a place where I had access to Wi-Fi and intended to do work for the day at a location away from home. If I had known you need Wi-Fi in order to use a pin I never would have set one up and it was not apparent that this was the case when I set up a pin. I'm going to try and see if I can remove the necessity to have a pin but then I worry about the security so I'll probably have to get a thumbprint login for the USB or something. If I can't figure out another solution I will be returning the laptop. I have another Windows 11 laptop that does not require Wi-Fi to do a pin login so it seems that if something specific to this computer. I think it's quite ridiculous to not have a system or you could log into a computer without wi-fi. But I mostly annoyed because there was no warning that this was the case when I set up the pin. Or if there was they did not make it obvious.Rest for speed, it does okay but it crashed when I was doing render work for video editing within the first week and what I was doing was not very intense. It also is not substantially faster than my basic laptop that has no fancy video card before rendering.It was a reasonable deal money wise but I'm not as impressed as I hoped to be.

These were not trivial; they could go across the entire screen and really distract. While I didn't use the laptop for gaming, I was a hardcore gamer years ago and knew had I gamed with it the absolutely atrocious screen would have been unacceptable. This was by far the worse laptop and computer screen I've used in over 20 years, and that's even including ones that were used for years before I got my hands on them! I had to get a refund based on the terrible screen. I almost certainly got a defective unit, as I'd think people would be up in arms near unanimously had they gotten what I'd gotten out of this laptop. Still, this was my experience- and if it happened to me, it could happen to you too.Outside of that fatal flaw, I didn't have any big issues with it aside from the keyboard only lighting up for a brief period after I'd hit the keys, then the lights would turn off. I found this distracting in darker settings, and kept missing keys in that context when the keyboard wasn't lit up. Also, a minor flaw was the unintuitive connection for the power; as other reviewers here have mentioned, you've got to get two click type feelings connecting the power to the laptop for the power to start transmitting, and you need to put forth far more force than when connecting pretty much any modern device to power. If you plug it in like a normal device, it will transmit zero power and the laptop won't even turn on. The power connection oddity had me at first wondering if the laptop could even be turned on.I ended up doing testing between this laptop and a competitor in the same price range with the same sized screen (Asus TUF A17 made in 2022), and the Asus not only had a superior screen that didn't show any artifacts, but also the memory and CPU usage was noticeably less in similar to mildly more difficult conditions on that Asus vs this Acer.

Do not buy!,"I really shopped around for a laptop I could use for video editing and graphic design. The Acer Nitro 5 AN517-54-79L1 had decent reviews and it seemed like the best option in my price range. Well, the first one I ordered had problems so I had to send it back, then the replacement Amazon sent had the exact same problems so I had to send that back too!The issues (and general things I just disliked):* A weird graphics glitch where the screen would take on a ""double image"" effect. Nothing would get rid of this but a restart, and then the problem would eventually come back.* Another weird graphics glitch where I'd be watching a video (on Youtube or elsewhere) and suddenly the video would start scrolling quickly from right to left, over and over. Again, the only way to stop this was a restart. These problems happened on both models, and the people at Amazon tech support couldn't fix it.* Loud fans under any significant graphics load. Loud enough to make you worry something might be wrong. I've since switched to a computer with an RTX360 and it seems to handle graphics much better. I never tried playing games with the Nitro but if it was whirring like that with simple graphics software I imagine it'd have a meltdown if you tried to play a modern game.* The case is thin and has way too much flex, especially on the first model. On more than one occasion I picked up the laptop while it was playing a video or audio, I was just moving it normally, and as my hand gripped the case I'd feel the plastic flex, I'd accidentally crush the works inside and the audio would sloooooow down and get wonky. That's WAY too much flex!* This computer is an absolute magnet for dust. I'd wipe it down and by the end of the day it looked filthy again. The stickers on the case also came off and left a weird, sticky residue. Both models always looked old and busted, despite being brand new.* The keyboard is black with faint red letters, only lighting up when you're actually typing on it. I knew about this and got a keyboard cover with printed letters, which helped, but otherwise the illegible keyboard would've driven me nuts.* It was just heavy enough that it was annoying to lug around.* The battery life was not very good.Acer has a decent rep as a company and as I said the reviews were good, but both of the Nitros I dealt with gave me endless problems.

My last Acer laptop had a motherboard failure (8 years old) and the ability to transplant its drive into this machine saved me from time consuming methods to retrieve my data. The surgery took less than ten minutes.Bus speeds for transferring large amounts of data between internal and external drives is extremely fast.Cons:The Nitrosense software allows full control of the speed of the dual fans. This would be great except for the fact that gaming makes it run extremely hot so I end up running the fans on max which is very loud and annoying.Windows 11!

I tried running it unplugged for the first time today and within 20 minutes, I was at 13%. Amazon customer service passed me off to Acer.

Okay so I ordered this laptop for my daughter's birthday. So on day one I told her it will not turn on till you charge it so first thing she did was plugged it in and let it charge a few moments later we powered it up and my daughter was super excited so she went on to download a game she likes to play online. So the next day she goes to play the game and the screen froze shortly into the game so first thing was to wait to see if maybe it was lag but after a minute or so nothing still froze. Mouse didn't move so next I pushed alt, control, delete. Nothing so the ESC and nothing then the windows key. So I powered it down and powered back up keyboard lights up but no display so I hold the power key down for 15 seconds nothing. So I decided to power down again and power up and nothing but the keyboard powers up. So I this point I'm upset and my daughter is super bummed after being super happy and excited a moment ago .so I called costumer support and they let me know that my computer is under warranty and it can be taken care of but I get cut off and I'm running late for work so I decided I'd call back after work. So I called again and talked to costumer support again so went through the same conversation and then they said they could refund my money or replace it I optioned for a replacement they said ok but because of the price there supervisor would have to ok it I said ok so after about ten minutes on the phone the till me that there supervisor can't ok the transaction that they have to wait for the morning supervisor to do this I said fine and that I would be contacted the next day....... Well it's been so it's been 4 days and nothing I'm starting to feel scammed by Amazon for some reason. So in my opinion stay away from this laptop and DO NOT BUY ANY Electronics from AMAZON.Pros.

The USB-C on this laptop is only a standard USB 3.2 Gen 2 port that DOES NOT support the displayport alt function.I thought it may have been the adapter/hub I was using at first so I bought 5 others with varying capabilities and the results were the same. The USB port will work but the display ports do not. I ended up finding the online user manual for this exact model (on Acer's site) and sure enough, it says that this model has a standard USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port rather than the thunderbolt 4 port on some of their other models.This was very disappointing to me since this laptop meets my needs in every other aspect.

But overall my experience was simply not good, I hate that I am even going through the refund process as this isn't how I work, I'm also an Amazon Vine member, I try to promote good products and leave feedback that could be beneficial. Though this return process and refund scenario is always a pain for probably good reasons.Though, Unpackaging, installing and playing all was totally fine and operational, ran pretty good on some demanding games. Though this computer was supposed to be brand new and came riddled with power issues, even fully charged It shuts off, Plugged in, shuts off and during gaming shuts off. It's difficult to tell when there is no windows event logs tracking any crashes, I can't imagine It's a GPU or heating issue, I would maybe imagine something revolving around the Power/Battery area.",06-28-2023,06-28-2023

Mine only has one M.2 SSD slot, and it came with two 8GB RAM sticks, not one 16GB stick. The only way to expand the memory is to replace one or both of the installed RAM with larger capacity RAM sticks. Same is true of the SSD hard drive, the only way to expand the size is to replace the existing drive with a larger one, or install a SATA SSD with the provided hardware. Problem with replacing it with a larger M.2 is, the license code for Windows 11 is encrypted on the drive, so unless you're tech-savvy, you will need to have it done by a professional.In gaming mode, once the fans kick on, the battery life drops to somewhere between one and two hours, and less if you are running it in VR. I tested it with a Samsung Odyssey Plus (Windows Mixed Reality), it drained over 50% of the battery in less than 15 minutes.While it is what it says it is, a 'gaming laptop' it barely meets the requirements.

I'll include notes about that as well.Sound Quality Pros: I really enjoy music from different genres and I like to tinker with equalizer settings so that I get the fullest sound out of even a cheap speaker. I also like when a speaker(s) can pull double duty as a surround sound system for my television as well. That's what attracted me to the new Echoes.Regarding music streaming from Amazon Music HD, I must say the sound is really smooth and crisp. I adjusted the equalizer settings for the individual devices in the Alexa app to boost the mid most, followed closely by the treble and a moderate bass setting (if they are paired in a stereo pair or Home Theater, adjusting one device automatically adjusts the other). I have my Echoes placed about 12 feet away in front ofmy primary seating spot on the sofa and the are spaced about 8 feet apart flanking the television. They are situated about 4 feet off the ground on book shelves.This positioning has been perfect for the accoustics in my 15x18 living room with tall ceilings. The speakers really fill up the space. And I am most impressed with how the sound bounces off of the walls and truly feel as if it surrounds me and immerses my eardrums into it.This holds even more true for when I watch a movie with the Dolby Atmos setting on. I can hear the channels fairly well and it really seems like I own my own private movie theater in my living room. There's been times that there's a sound affect so specific to one channel and reproduced so clearly that I've actually muted the show thinking that I was hearing some noise from outside or in the hallway of my apartment building.These two devices together get pretty loud without any noticeable distortion. Now I haven't played much bass heavy music but I do love action and sci-fi movies that are sound effect laden and peppered with bass booming explosions etc. The new 4th Gen Echoes keep up very nicely.In contrast, though I thought I really loved the Echo Plus 2nd Gen, I now find that I really can't enjoy music or movies as much on it. I think that this is because the main speaker fires downward and the rest of the sound is omni directional. This sounds good on paper but in practice, at least for my uses, that type of speaker just seems muffled and really a waste of sound waves. Let me explain. How often to you place the Echo device in the center of a room to benefit from an omni-directional speaker? Most people don't have floor outlets under their coffee tables so it sits on an end table or bookshelf. It's usual home in a bedroom is on the end table. Even in a kitchen, unless placed on the island, the Echo rests with it's back to a wall. So, why then, would you want (let's say) 40% of the sound waves to be directed to a big slab with no ears to appreciate it?The directional sound setup of the new Echo 4th Gen is ideal, really, for it's positioning in most homes. Sound is really diminished if you are behind it or immediately to it's side but comes barrelling at your ear drums when you are any angle in front of it. It's louder, more clear, and much more advanced when it comes to being able to utilize Dolby Atmos playback. I definitely choose the 4th gen over the 2nd Gen Plus any day. I almost feel bad for unloading the Plus onto my parents when I bought the 4th Gen. I'll upgrade them this Christmas. Lol.The omni-directional speaker would be a benefit if it were placed in the center of a patio for a gathering or party, but again, where's your outlets? Not in the middle of the concrete or deck floor. So chances are, even on the patio, it will be placed backing up to an exterior wall. So the myth of the omni-directional speaker advantage is busted in my book.Voice Recognition:At first, I felt there was a noticeable difference with the Plus having the upper hand when I comes to summoning Alexa. However, I believe there have been some fairly large software updates recently that included fine tuning adjustments to the mics on the 4th Gen devices. They now clearly pick up my questions or commands from across the room and quickly cancel out the other Echo Dot I have on the far side open floor plan nearest the kitchen. Before, with the Plus, it was a toss up as to which one would respond because I firmly believe the best mics are still on the Echo Dot 3rd Gen with clock variant. Hands down. If only the echo show 5 in my bedroom would be even half as good, I'd be happy ( that unit is by far the worst with just 2 lack luster mics vs the 4 on the Dot and Plus).Alexa is also quicker to respond on the 4th Gen too. Now that's a combination of the 450-ish gbps internet speed I am fortunate enough to have but I understand it's also due to a better processor and improved software.And let me just say one thing... I don't know anyone who buys their smart home devices withZigbee compatibility being the #1 consideration.Who cares? I have bought the best reviewed for the price smart bulbs, TV, and plugs etc not giving a thought to Zigbee because the latest generation smart devices don't require a hub.All of my smart home devices work just fine by enabling the skill on the Alexa app with that of the manufacturer's chosen app and linking the accounts. The biggest issue I have is trying to remember what I named each lamp and group to turn on and off the lights. First world problems, I know.For what it's worth, the big 3 smart home apps which seems to be used by these el cheapo devices are Kasa, Govee, and Smart Life. I have devices on all three and the Alexa integration is seemless. Except the darn ceiling fan speed control. Still haven't completely figured that one out entirely.Setting up the devices and Grouping:Both the Echo Plus and 4th Gens are very easy to set up initially. The Alexa app, though not entirely user friendly regarding the UI, does all the work and guides you through the process fairly quickly. The oddball thing that's a bit more challenging is knowing what the difference is between a stereo pair, a home theater and a speaker group.First, a stereo pair must be two identical models (I believe an Echo Sub woofer can be added as the one off) and the pairing is only for music streaming. Only one Echo will respond at a time when you are conversationally interacting with Alexa.In a Home Theater grouping, one or more Echo devices of the same model can be joined with a FireTV device such as the Stick 4k. A sub can also be added. The crummy part at first, is that you can't include your existing sound bar into this Home Theater Group. Amazon devices only, folks. So you must choose which you want to listen to.Now, I'm not horribly disappointed because the sound quality of the two 4th Gens on each side of the TV is really great so the sound bar isn't needed but I hate the thought of the wasted money sitting 32 inches wide in front of me producing no sound at all.IF, you have a smart TV like a Vizio, there is a way to activate the sound bar and have the Amazon Home Theater working at the same time. And here it is: the sound bar must be hooked up to an optical cable and the audio setting on the TV must be set to PCM not automatic. Auto defaults to whatever device you are streaming on ie a FireTV Stick. Then, while playing your FireTV Stick, choose the Home Theater as your audio source on the Fire TV menu. So in essence, the TV thinks it must send sound to the sound bar only while the Stick thinks it should be using the Home Theater. Through whatever glitch, I now have all three speakers working in tandem. BUT ONLY while using the FireTV device. It does not work if I am using the smart TV streaming apps from the Vizio home screen. Which I don't do anymore except for a couple things that are not found on the Amazon App store.FYI, I don't believe that the Fire Edition Insignia and Toshiba televisions sold here and at Best Buyhave the capability to set up the Home Theater function with the Alexa app.Finally, a speaker group is the best way to get unlike models to sync with each other to play music. However, there's a catch... You must ask for that group's every time at the end of your request to play music etc.Meaning, with the stereo pair and home theater, music and movies are automatically played through those selected speakers by means of the Alexa app. You would simply make the standard request for Alexa to play a song or album with no extra added specification. But remember, you're limited to only pairing the same models together for this to work like that.Now, with a speaker group, you can include your Echoes, Dots, Shows, Spots, Inputs, FireTVs, Tablets etc etc into that group and have them all going at the same time through out your home, so long as you name this all-Echo inclusive group something like ""Every where"" or ""all speakers"" or ""whole house"". Be creative :) ""Echo Symphonic Orchestra"", ""Live from the Love Shack"", or ""on all decks of the Enterprise"" (you can even call your individual room groupings for lights and sounds things like "" the Bridge"" -Living Room, ""Ship's Galley"" -Kitchen, ""Ten Forward"" - dining or rec room, ""Shuttle Bay Two""-garage, "" Engineering""-utility room/basement, and ""Captain's Quarters""-master bedroom, ""Risa"" -backyard patio). Lol. Alexa groups can be named whatever you want! I digress though....The point is you have to tell Alexa to play music AND include the name of the speaker group everytime or else music will just play from the device you speak into. Ex: ""Alexa play the song Starships on all decks of the Enterprise"" or (boring) ""Alexa, play Mr. Robot-o, everywhere"" or ""Play a lullaby in the dirty diaper factory (nursry)"". Get it?! I can sense your mind is starting to ignite like a solid rocket booster, now.I really hope this helps someone. I know it's been a learning curve for me. And not always a lot of fun. Just wait til you first start exploring how to build your own custom routines or then decide to relocate devices into different rooms as you upgrade with new ones. It can be a labor of love...or regret.Bottom line, if youare looking to upgrade but aren't entirely sure, try out the new Echo 4th Gen (especially in a pair for a Home Theater) and decide within 30 days if you really like them. Definitely explore the Alexa app and routines. And commit to replacing at least one bulb in each room with a color changing LED smart bulb to experience the fun you can have with this device. Also, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what many people say is a drawback about being a directional speaker is really a benefit for most user's needs, including yours.Some people will find fault in anything and some will find that they can't have everything to their exact liking. There's not a perfect smart speaker out there, so figure out what you must have features are, your nice to haves, and your deal breakers are and make the choice.Regardless, enjoy these little glimpses of the future. Heck, they're even spherical shaped just like what the future devices and ships looked like in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Space Balls or a Borg scout ship, even. You gotta think that's at least a nice nod for sci-fi fans everywhere. Or if you are a devotee of mod design or simply a believer in form following function, then this ball of joy is sure to please. So, enjoy your new Echo; It's outta this world!-Picard, out. Hailing frequencies closed.",04-06-2021,04-06-2021

This new Amazon processor promises better voice recognition and faster Alexa responses.In my testing so far, I have barely noticed a slight speed improvement (for example turning on certain room lights) but there are supposed to be upcoming updates that will make an even bigger difference in speed.Zigbee + Sidewalk Bridge.This comes with a Zigbee hub, just like previous versions of the Echo Plus.It also contains the new Sidewalk Bridge, which allows the Echo to use bluetooth and radio connections to connect to some smart devices at long range, and push data to the internet.THE BAD:No 360 degree speakers.While I personally prefer the sound of this new version, some people might miss the 360 degree speaker setup of previous Echo generations.It certainly might lead to a situation where the ideal placement of the Echo in your room could be different.White power cord.This is minor, but a strange choice.No matter what color Echo you get, the power cord is white.Some people might find that annoying.Voice detection is not great while loud music is playing.This surprised me, as previous generations haven;t really struggled with this in my experience.I'm not sure if it is because this speaker is much louder, but Alexa hasn't heard me a few times when I talked while the music was playing at max volume.This could be annoying if you often listen to very loud music.NEUTRAL: -Aesthetics.I think I preferred the look of the cylinder design, instead of this new sphere shape.This is totally personal preference of course.I also wish the entire sphere was fabric, instead of being plastic on the back side.Some people might prefer the ball shape though, so that is up to you.All in all, I'm keeping this new Echo because of the better sound and faster responsiveness, but it is not really a massive upgrade.Pretty decent so far, I'll update this review and try to answer any questions in the future!",12-15-2020,12-15-2020

Best small combo on the market","I bought two of these refurbed, so I saved a ton of money. 1 echo for $100, two refurbs for $120. No brainer, and I wanted stereo off the bat. Hooked them up with Alexa, painless. Listened for an hour or so, grabbed a sub…needed it. By themselves, they sounded crystal clear, great mids (I’m a live sound man, mids are critical..after drums). But the low end was obviously lacking. Good for a desk in a small office, maybe, but these suckers get LOUD with zero distortion. I like the way a paired set defaults to one volume control. Nice.I got the sub, hooked it up relatively painlessly, fired up a test track, “Riding the Crest” by a-ha. Super deep lows, pristine mids, top notch highs. I actually hat to turn the bass down. Amazing sound.Two tips-as much as you’re tempted to hide them, don’t. They need to be out in the open. Two tweeters on the front point out in either direction, for max coverage. The mid/low speaker is on top, facing downwards a bit. Get the picture?Stick ‘‘em in a bookcase or enclosed shelf, all the sound is close to completely muffled. Keep ‘em out completely. Yes, they’re a ball. So are baseballs and basketballs. The whole reason for that was to use larger speakers in a wider sound pattern-something the tube style couldn’t do.The sub-no brainer. I know , Sonos is supposed to sound better. They don’t. They actually sound worse. Add in their sub with the lauded variable crossover…unless you’re an immediate super audiophile, it’s gonna sound like mush. That’s where Amazon was smart. The crossover between the echoes and the sub is perfect, almost seamless. One reason-they were designed that way. Now, another tip. I know countless mags and audiophiles tell you you can hide a sub anywhere.Bull crud. They need to be out in the open. Not going into frequency science here, but the best position for the sub is about a foot out on any side-don’t stick it in a corner. It’s designed to fire out all the way around, it’s pointed toward the floor. Those little slots absolutely need to be clear all the way around. I’ve got the two echoes (I kid you not) on top of a pair of highish end KRK studio monitors. The sub is on the floor, a little to the left of the left hand echo, about maybe 10 feet from my head, sub out in the open.Bam. Easily the best sounding system I’ve heard in its class. Sorry, Sonos, no comparison. See ya. Of course,,my studio rig demolishes them, but to be fair, the two 8” 200watt each biamped and room tuned desktops have a range of 34hz to 40kHz. That’s about 22kHz higher than the human ear can hear. The somewhat overdone matching 400 watt sub goes all the way down to 18hz…the human ear stops at 32hz. So yeah, obviously sound better. Cost $1500 USD, they’d better sound better than my echoes. Jet’s be realistic here.Simply put, this little setup ain’t gonna fill a huge living room with a 72” whatdidyabuythatcrapfor?Drop ‘em an a bedroom of a decent size, or a small tv room, you will not be disappointed. One last thing… people here complain about dropped signals, unpairing…these things run off wi-fi. They don’t directly connect, so if your router is two rooms awa with a fridge in the way, you’ll be dropping signal, same as your laptop..they need to either be near the router, or at least have one or two boosters for a clear shot. I have yet to drop at all, no random unpairing, zero problems. Keep that in mind…even though I have a 1.2 gHz internet speed, I only get 600mHz or a bit more across the house. Get your signal path clear.No more problems.",09-21-2023,09-21-2023

I’m living in the future and that Future is here NOW!,"I have 8 Echos in various rooms and from several generations. Yep, I have a big house... What attracted me to this generation was that onboard voice capabilities that makes response faster and sure, who doesn’t want even better sound quality? I also liked the design better than the looks of the previous generations and that I could see the activity ‘light ring’ when I was sitting down. The spherical designed has some real advantages and it’s apparent in the improved sound. And improved it is. Music is easily better, more complex and effortless. This is NOT supposed to be a blast the neighborhood out speaker, but it did fill a larger room with quality sounding music that is noticeably improved to past generations. Voice commands and responses are practically instant and tigger happy quickly improved... Me likes so much that I replaced 2 of my 8 for in the areas where I am most using them. I even returned my first gen to amazon to get 25$ off then new one. Understand, my old ones are in pristine condition with all the original packaging and boxes, but how great to be able to do this!My whole house is voice controlled, lighting, fireplaces (ceramic logs with LED ‘fake fire lights’), thermostat and as an early adopter of the Echo Voice Assistant, I’ve never looked back. Being able to ask any question, to ask about a stores hours before even driving there to make sure it’s open and then being given the option to phone DIRECTLY from the device, is sweet. And how about NEVER having to touch your alarm clock to hit snooze or turn it off again? Yes please. Get quick and accurate local weather reports instantly, air quality too! Need to be reminded, multiple timers or announcements and intercom functions. Just say the word. I have every news channel I want set in my flash briefing and LOVE these, hearing them most days. Here’s my line up:Daily scripture, this day in history, Fox news, BBC news, Management tip of the day and a few more. You can easily add what YOU want to hear and it’s a treat. I LOVE podcasts and there’s a series called “Hardcore History” with hundred of episodes. Some of which are 6 hours long! What’s cool is I can start one of these while I’m cooking in the kitchen, tell the device to stop when I’m finished and when I later (day, month, weeks or whatever) tell it to “Play Hardcore History” it will name the episode I left off on and pick it up for exactly the same spot! How sweet that??And guys, knock yourselves out because there are thousands of podcasts on virtually any subjects to enjoy and learn from. I love having this ability!!! LOVE, Love, love the ability to always be learning new things from this device while still doing what I do do in the background. There’s so much more and I could literally go on for hours with what a great enhancement this has been in so many ways, learning, security, information, entertainment, news, communications, etc. Being able to have my arms full, walk though my house and just TEll a light to turn on along the way without having to touch or find a switch is sublime!Yep, you need the right lights, but boy, talk about convenience and living in the future now. NEVER going back!Even my landscaping lights and sprinkler control system, my security cameras works with it. And if I want to make an announcement to the whole house, I just say, “Echo, repeat EVERYWHERE” and then tell it what I want to say. And all 8, in every room will go off: “Dinner is in 5 minutes!” So sweet!I also have 2 of the Echo Clocks that work with the device and they are awesome. The LED ring and countdown before the alarm going off is sweet.But guys, I even LOVE just telling the Echo to play rain/storm sound effects and it’s calming, deep and healing. What a wonderful, effortless device with so many capabilities. Even during one of my personal bible studies, I can ask Echo for some background on virtually anyone I reading about and background is forthcoming.Yes, I was an early adopter and man, these are a purchase I’ve never regretted making. I use them EVERY day and they have enhanced my life in ways that are special, rich and convenient. Like something out of a Dick Tracy comic from the 1930’s, this system is here, ripe, mature and developed. I’m such a fan!The only suggestion I have for Amazon would be to give me the option in a metal package. Who wants to dust fabric? Lastly, IF you built in even great Biblical knowledge capability, you’d sell even millions more. Give me a teaching assistant that has a data base to field just about anything biblical I could ask of it.LOVING this product and the direction it’s going. The future IS now and ECHO is the best, most supported, device with thousands and thousands of functions. Thank you Amazon and keep enhancing this baby because I’m upgrading all along the way. I returned on for a discount and the other 1st gen is going to a charity raffle. And heck, it’s in perfect condition with all the original packaging and boxes.Hot Dog!-G",11-03-2020,11-03-2020

If I had to complain though it would be easy truthfully. The music function. I had the advertised Unlimited plus music feature, after it was advertised as the only way for my grandmother to play certain old songs she was looking for with ease instead of her asking and then getting a different song with an advertisement worked in. However, it worked out for 2 seconds because I thought, why not pay more and get an Amazon Echo dot too for her room ao she could listen through the house. So that apparently added almost 20 bucks a month to a free service we had before. Mind you, I already pay for Prime and I added the Music Unlimited. But because she wanted to play her music softly in her room for ambience and then play it differently in the livingroom, Amazon said she had to upgrade to another more expensive music package called Unlimited Family. Thats the only way to she can listen to music she wants on her devices throughout her home. Again, the service costs more than most video services and is more than spotify, xm radio, or well just about any radio service that allows the option to pick a song via voice recognition these days. They really like to nickel and dime you for the most basic things and it isnt riggt in my opinion. If you pay to have music options through Amazons library, why should you pay more and more for ease of getting to that music? I mean, Amazon music uses to have all the music I could ever look for free with my Amazon Prime membership. And I think they added the voice search feature before this fee on top of a fee thing happened. It is crazy to me that every time you want to actually use the products that come out to the desirable extent they are advertised, you get either microtransactions blown at you, or even worse now you get a hefty monthly additional bill. Again, after being a member with the company paying a monthly fee for over a decade. Why would they think this would keep customer loyalty? All it does is make customers hope for and await another option that has something similar or even a little less nice for a better price. Can you imagine if a competitor like Ebay or Facebook got together and created a decent music library access via buying something like soundcloud or spotify. It has to be easy for the CEOs to themeselves want another option on a platform built similar to the Echo. And people themselves in the public that for the middle class have to like me be eager to seek out that second option. Yes the supply chain and easy shipping options makes it the onlyntrue source to buy things quickly and easily and Prime is still a great deal for that reason. But the echo, the dot, etc... are all just waiting to be taken off the shelves at this rate. And it is awful, because the advertised version and or even the versions where you can use the full functionality after burning a million dollars on unlocking them each month proves the Echo and its component products can do and be great products that make amazon something worth keeping a membership with for years to come. However, selling a product to active prime members and then putting limiters all over the software with the intent to create more monthly revenue on a loyal cusyomer base that you could of just succeeded in making that much more reliant on keeping a membership. Thats jist greedy and dumb at the same time. The echo or other products of this line have zero need to have these extra upcharges is the point. Get rid of them before your customers get rid of the products tge moment a better option becomes viable. Yes we will keep prime for the shipping. But heck, prime video is just rediculous right now with advertisements, fees for decent shows and movies and then just nothing of real value for prime members. It used to be a great service with limited options. But we loved and used it all the same because it was free for Prime members. Same with Amazon music. I loved it and used it all the time. No its advertisements for every song or monthly fees. So tired of the fee onslaught that comes with buying anything that looks like its useful these days. Thats the summary here. Amazon, you dont need to do what your doing. Your products have the ability to be in every household and used regularly everywhere. You will make a killing just selling the next updated color of the echo. Imstead of closing up video and music access. Eat the costs on rights and give it to your prime customers. You already raised rates for that too. But your cutting services on top of raising rates. What are you thinking. Your monopoly isnt unbeatable. Its difficult to see past the day people choose something better knowing what your chains look like right now. But Im telling you, this way of pushing customers for everything you want just because you can at the moment will end up making you the myspace of well....you know. Thats just my and millions of other peoples opinion though right now. So take it for what its worth.",03-17-2023,03-17-2023

Publish a roadmap - on what features will be added to device (considering that the device is 3 year old and still going on).2. Explore if Wifi can be added to device (as mesh node).other feedback:Amazon could do more with Alexa. e.g. I should be able to pair new smart devices with my amazon echo just using voice. Using phone should be optional. That would make this device a must have.Occationally my audio shuts off. I understand that this is potentially due to internet stream issue (but I am supposed to be using streaming services of amazon itself).

The reason I switched to Alexa from Apple for smart home controls was over not being able to connect most Apple HomeKit devices into HomeKit, and the blasted issue of only being able to select more than one, ..1, ..ONE! echo speaker at a time to play music. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room or even pair echo speakers. Hundreds of tries. I deleted, rebooted, spent 4 hours with Comcast getting my internet working again today because I rebooted my modem and router so much, they got molasses slow and stopped trying.In interest I also am trying a few Google speakers. They wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries.Thursday, I broke down and bought my first homepod mini (wow, sound is really nice, but too high of price), and it gave me a hint how to solve all these other internet blocks.It kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast. I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.” That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months.Tonight, I finally am able to play music at the same time on all my Echo speakers. I definitely will be putting these all over. Love.For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this setting, so I thought I’d share. It may be out there, but it’s buried in the plethora of inquiries of people pleading for solutions.I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to putt all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi.",12-10-2023,12-10-2023

I wanted my wife to be able to call me from anywhere if she falls. They work great and I used my PC to set them all up, and later to changes the names and activation words.I was very frustrated when they took the PC management program down, and make you now use a cell phone.I do own a cell phone, an older version Android that is not up to release 9.0 OS, so it cannot run the app to manage my system now. I wanted to add one more unit and change some of the names, but I have not discovered a work around.A new cell phone is up into the $200 bracket, and I rarely even use it, as I am retired. This is more money then a new Echo unit! Yet we have 4 PC's in the house and use them a lot.I am truly disappointed with Amazon for making this change, without considering everyone in the US is not glued to a cell phone or needs it, and spends that much for one. I am looking for other options but my wife loves the radio, news, and music of these units, and now I do not know what can replace all that.Ok it a couple weeks later and I decided to upgrade my Andriod cell phone to a 2023 model , and we simple do not want to live without the Echo units anymore, and there is no real replacement for all they can do!",01-17-2024,01-17-2024

When I learned how overpriced the Sonos were (and that they didn’t even have bluetooth connectivity) I opted for the echo and a couple dots instead. The sound quality is perfectly adequate for me and my apartment living, and I like that I can adjust the equalizer settings with the Alexa app. Definitely not as full of sound as the Sonos, and I don’t think it can get as loud, but it’s fine for me. The only irritating thing is how glitchy Alexa is, that you can’t control the volume of her spoken responses (way too loud ALWAYS), and the many glitches between the Alexa system and various other services/skills, but that’s really an Alexa problem vs. the speaker. Oh, also the voice recognition can be spotty. I swear Alexa never understands me when I speak commands in an angry tone 🤣 Very weird.",02-14-2024,02-14-2024

Twice as big but sound 5 times Better!!!,"I have my apartment which is not a small apartment and it has a loft as well for my 12-year-old son so he has his own area he’s getting to that age so anyway I had I think 5 echo dots and one echo show that had the visual screen for pictures and things like that but without a subwoofer or anything I was fine with the multi room music and I used it for that and basically also used it so I could just tell any of my echo dots or just basically when I open the door I would say Alexa Turn on my apartment!! Immediately all of my lights would come on and some of them are dimmed to a certain level which you can do in the settings on your Alexa app that most people have on their phones. I even have a couple lightbulbs that are multicolored so I have them set to green and red currently for Christmas!! So the lights all come on when I tell Alexa to do that including my living room TV as well. You can add numerous other items that are compatible with Alexa and/or SmartThings app and you name it. If you don’t have something that is compatible or doesn’t have Bluetooth or wifi etc… as long as you use a plugin for that item you can at MINIMUM turn it off and on with your voice or touch screen on your phone or Alexa show and I bought 2 of these Echoes because my friends have one or more and it is a sphere. So even though it’s twice as big as the echo dot, in the newer generations at least, they started out looking like a hockey puck which is still good and people have them still but I started using Alexa products just a couple years ago so, mine are all round balls that you can talk to and play music and control lights and cameras for security while home or check on your home while you’re not there!!I bought 2 regular Echoes to replace 2 of the echo dots because they have 3 or 4 different speakers in each one!!! Crazy how much sound you get from the dot but the bigger one the regular echo, sounds like a huge floor speaker but it’s just a ball and you can get black or white or blue and more so I got 2 of them to pair together for stereo sound and to my Samsung TV that has an Alexa app built into it. So I can rock out or get surround sound when paired with my TV and Soundbar Sub woofer which I don’t use the soundbar anymore the echoes sounded better but I got them last month. They were 49.99 a piece!!! That’s like half price and why I hadn’t bought them before so for 100 bucks I have a completely wonderful set of speakers that you barely notice and they sound wonderful and you can buy them with a Studio speaker by Amazon or an Amazon Subwoofer bundled for even more awesome sound but I live in an apartment so I don’t want to get kicked out!!! They act as a hub for all of your Amazon devices also so you don’t need anything else but one echo honestly to run all of your lights just get the type of bulbs they suggest and they have bundles for those also and it’s truly amazing what quality of sound and other things that they can do but I have already typed far toooooo much. Start with 1 even for listening to music over the holidays and add devices as you go. That’s what I did and 2 years later I have it set up so we’ll that I can talk to my son when he’s at his Moms house on his echo and my echo here and there’s no need for buying him a cellphone!! Yet!!There’s just so much I could say about what these things do for 50 bucks to get one of them is a steal because you’re just keep adding things and finding different things like grocery list reminders and alarms. It helps you with many things you wouldn’t even imagine.So now, when I open my door to my apartment, I have it set to where the lights automatically come on with my TV. I don’t even have to talk. It’ll do that too so kudos to the designers of these things because they are very affordable and do so much.!!!",11-22-2022,11-22-2022

And I didn't think I was going to wind up using it very much but being visually impaired I wound up using it a lot more than I expected.I came to find out that I could listen to my audible books and also my kindle books read to me which is great for my visual impairment it makes it a lot more enjoyable during the day when I become bored with trying to figure out what is actually on the television with my provision some things are just not watchable like they used to be.But the echo. 2nd Gen. Speakers are well they leave a lot to be desired and I had to add additional speakers so when I saw this item I was like I'm gonna go see what the reviews are like and everyone said they were awesome they're awesome and so much better than the. 2nd Gen. So I decided to go ahead and get one for my birthday as a gift to myself and additionally I got the battery and the silicone carry case combination to go with it and I can take the thing all over my house in my yard and that is so cool.Since I've gotten this particular one though I have found there are so many other things that I can do with it other than just listen to my audio books and kindle books I can listen to podcasts I can get the daily news I can check the temperature in the room that the echo is in it is in which is really cool because I don't have an interior thermostat in my house I run on a space here and a wood stove so I never know what the interior temperature of my house is but I do now.There are also cool games you can play play I've been playing prices right and Trivia and a choose your own adventure kind of game andAre you smarter than a 5th grader by the way I'm smarter than a 5th grader.I opted in for Amazon music and not only am I finding all the songs that I've forgotten from my past but I found some really cool new ones things things that I would have never found without this echo.I've created playlists that when I'm in the mood for one thing or another I just tell she who cannot be named what playlist I want to hear and all of a sudden there I am.She can also actuate my televisionI have a roku TV but I have also added a fireStick as well and she can actuate both of them and also my easy buzz camera that I have to keep an eye on my front porch and yard and be able to speak to people out there when I have guests without going to the door.Being visually impaired this thing is a real helping hand the only thing would be better is if she could clean my house maybe Amazon will get there eventually.But for now I'm very fond of this deviceOther cool additional thingsI like how much bass the speaker has I like to listen to binaural beats music and meditation music and some dance music for exercise and I can feel the music it's pretty cool.The speaker is pretty darn decent.I chose the white version because because white is a color that I can see better with my vision the only concern I have is that the speaker cover might eventually get dirty but they get dirty I try to dust it on a daily basis just to make sure.We also are using it for well-to-do list for one, alarms, oh and I've set a household network up where the smaller echo. that I was gifted is now in my kitchen and I can play them as a group oop or someone in my kitchen can drop in on me and ask me if I want dinner or if I'm busy and vice versa I can drop in on them as well well additionally I've set it up so I can tell it to make phone calls directly from my cell phone and works as a great speaker phone I've tested it out a few times and everybody says that they can hear me just fine and clear.By the way for a little fun ask her to Beam me up Scottie.

If you're used to room enveloping sound with no sense of stereo this one will disappoint. Dual tweeters firing forward give it a true sense of direction so sticking it in a corner and have it fill the room will not be as satisfying.You'll notice where it's located more, especially if there's anything blocking your direct line of sight ( hearing ) . Where I keep mine only needed a slight shift to make it not be partially blocked by my sofa . Volume was still plenty loud in its old spot but it just didn't sound right. Easily solved but might not be that easy for others and some might actually prefer the directional sound more.The bass can be a bit boomy though while listening to YYZ live in Rio the bass drum didn't sound bad at all and overall everything was satisfactory though slightly lacking in the mid highs.The eq settings in the Alexa app are set to flat on all 3 choices .It's wider at the base than the previous generations by a lot. This could be a problem for some .Star Trek Self Destruct Skilldoesn't work on this one or my 4th gen Dot but does fine on my previous generation ones for some reason . Instead of blowing up my den it searches for ""zero zero zero"" movies on my Fire Stick. I'm sure that won't last long though .Enough about the bad.The bass is no longer wannabe but real. No longer does it struggle with everything below mid level voices but as I wrote above , bass drums actually sound like bass drums and Ends of the Earth by Lord Huron excels at all of the music ranges considering its size. Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams also sounded very nice across the sound spectrum . Music For Tables extreme from the high notes in the keyboard to the lows didn't miss a thing whereas the cow bellwas very slightly muddy but the wood blocks sounded right . Am I saying it's as awesome as my studio headphones ? Not by any means but they took a huge step forward over the 3rd generation , which I was quite content with .Response time seems noticeably faster and more accurate than the gen 3 I use . Only once did Alexa not understand my query and that was while setting up a traffic check routine. All I had to do was rephrase a little and now Alexa tells me the commute traffic and fastest way to get to work 5 minutes before I have to leave . 95 is terrible for accidents and Maps tells Alexa the best alternative if there's any.I think my favorite thing though is the new shape and I REALLY like the lights being on the bottom, especially once the lights go off .If you're still smitten with your gen 3 Echo or don't like the mini Death Star look of the new model skip this one as the performance improvements are readily apparent they're not earth shattering.Amazon will have to do something mind blowing next year to get me to part with my dough ray me for a gen 5. The more I listen to Fourplay on Echo the more I'm liking it for the music , nevermind all the super cool stuff I can do on it or my Dots or my Flex .",12-20-2020,12-20-2020

As a piece of ""hardware"", what you get in such a small package is impressive (5 stars).The other half of the rating is how well Alex integrates with your smart devices, and how well you use the capabilities within the Alex app to configure your Echo device.One of the most important functions is the ability to create ""routines"".A routine is a set of commands that get performed, when the trigger phrase is spoken.I'll say that the capabilities available with routines is mind blowing.Many people might be intimidated trying to set them up.If you are not tech savvy, you might need to find someone who is to help you out.I've got a computer engineering degree, and it was fairly intuitive for me, but I'm an extreme example...",02-10-2022,02-10-2022

This smart speaker has exceeded my expectations in various ways, providing convenience, entertainment, and an overall enhanced living experience.

First and foremost, the voice recognition capabilities of Alexa are outstanding. The accuracy with which it understands and responds to my commands is remarkable. I can ask questions, set reminders, create shopping lists, control smart home devices, and much more, all through natural language commands. It's like having a virtual assistant at my beck and call.

The sound quality of the Echo is also noteworthy. The audio is clear, crisp, and offers a surprising amount of depth and volume for a device of its size. Whether I'm listening to music, podcasts, or even audiobooks, the Echo delivers a pleasing audio experience that fills the room.

Integration with various services and apps is seamless. I can easily connect to streaming platforms like Spotify, Amazon Music, and Apple Music, making it effortless to enjoy my favorite tunes. The Echo's compatibility with smart home devices has also been incredibly convenient. I can control lights, thermostats, locks, and more, all through simple voice commands.

The routine feature is a game-changer for me. I've set up routines to start my day, which include turning on lights, providing weather updates, and playing my preferred news briefings. It's a great way to streamline my morning routine and get the day off to a productive start.

And let's not forget the skills and capabilities that Alexa continuously gains through updates. From jokes and trivia to language translation and recipe suggestions, there's always something new to explore and enjoy.

In conclusion, the Amazon Echo with Alexa is an excellent addition to any home. Its impressive voice recognition, sound quality, integration with services, routines, and constantly evolving skills make it a versatile and genuinely useful device.

The device features a Zigbee smart hub, improved sound reproduction, and a temperature sensor. Alexa integration works as expected. I would recommend the 4th gen Echo to those who are in the market for their first Alexa device and who listen to music often at a casual level. I would not recommend this as an upgrade for those with previous generation Echo devices if they are functioning normally, or for those expecting a high-end audiophile experience.PREFACE:---------------------------I have owned the 4th generation Amazon Echo for 9 months and use it daily. I upgraded from a 1st generation Amazon Echo. As part of a Prime Echo trade-in promotion, I was able to purchase this for $25 off the $99 MSRP.Tasks I utilize Echo for:---------------------------• (Daily) - Adjusting power/brightness/color of 2 connected LIFX smart bulbs• (Daily) - Retrieving daily weather forecast information• (Daily) - Retrieving temperature of the room the Echo is in (room is hotter than the rest of the house)• (Weekly/Monthly) - Engaging with various media/games (Pandora, Amazon Music, Question of the Day, Jeopardy, etc.)• (Weekly/Monthly) - General search query for basic information/knowledgeEnvironment:---------------------------The Echo is 3 feet away from where I sit. It’s placed on a table in the corner of a 10x10 room, about 2 inches in front of a (silent) PC tower. It's on a flat, level surface, and is within line-of-sight with no obstacles or materials between myself and it that would hamper its ability to hear me. On the opposite side of the room is a small air purifier at floor level that is always on and set to its lowest setting (40 dB of white noise).PROS:---------------------------• Sound Reproduction: The upward-firing 3” woofer and two, forward-firing 0.8” tweeters push out more sound than expected for a device of this size and price. Bass is surprisingly powerful, covers a lower frequency range than expected (it won't rattle the room like a dedicated subwoofer, however), and is capable of filling small rooms with ease. Treble is clear and crisp without distortion. Mids are pronounced and dynamic, but can be overpowered if bass and treble are simultaneously working hard. Dialogue from movies, videos, and podcasts is clear and feels well-balanced. Casual audio tinkerers will be pleased with additional EQ settings in the Amazon Alexa smartphone app, although audio sounds excellent as-is and adjustments are likely not necessary unless specific listening needs require adjustments.• Temperature Sensor: This is an odd bonus to me, but a welcome one that I use often. It is self-calibrating, and routines can make use of its readings.• Line In/Out Audio Jack: There is a 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the device next to the power adapter port which can be toggled to send audio out to another device if you wish to use the Echo with external speakers, or to accept audio if you wish play audio from another device using the Echo’s speakers.• Build Quality: It feels sturdy and has heft but isn’t burdensome. The fabric mesh that covers the top-half of the sphere is a nice color, the buttons are pleasantly tactile but quiet, and the circular grip on the bottom ensure it won’t slide around while playing music or if gently bumped.NEUTRALS:---------------------------• Response Time: Marketing for this Echo focused heavily on the all-new AZ1 Neural Edge processor at the time of purchase, bragging of faster, smoother, and more natural Alexa voice interaction performance and processing times. The marketing was heavy, and over-emphasized what is an unnoticeable difference; there is, at best, perhaps fractions of a second saved compared to the 1st gen Echo, but it’s case-by-case. In most cases, the processing time is the same.• Alexa Features/Performance: Largely unchanged compared to previous generations due to Alexa being a multi-device AI ecosystem rather than a single, device-specific feature. It does what you expect of Alexa.CONS:---------------------------• Voice Recognition: Bad. The environment outlined above is how I’ve used this Echo since I purchased it. The previous, 1st generation Echo had no issue with white noise, background noise, etc. This 4th generation Echo struggles to pick up my voice if there is any level of white noise, or if I’m speaking to it from more than a few feet away. 90 – 95% of voice interactions require that I repeat myself with increasing volume (sometimes two, three, four or more times) for it to register what I’m saying correctly, if I’m heard at all. Voice commands are constantly misinterpreted (verified by reviewing the history in the app), and wake words are often missed. Voice recognition performance is so poor, I have considered replacing this device altogether with one from a different ecosystem. I shouldn’t need to be just beneath shouting volume to be heard, and I shouldn’t feel constantly inconvenienced by using voice commands versus smartphone apps to control smart home features.• Temperature Sensor Rate of Refresh: I have found no documentation or answers about how often the temperature sensor is refreshed. However, it often seems like the readings are delayed and take a long time to change, even when there is a noticeable increase/decrease in air temperature as a result of thermostat changes.",10-03-2021,10-03-2021

The Alexa app that ""controls"" them seemingly could not be worse if they tried. So many things you ""can't"" do. For a smart speaker it might as well be connected to an old school amp for how inconveniently it plays radio stations, pandora, etc. I'm almost sure I'm not taking advantage of some features but then again it's almost impossible to find out what they may be and how I would ""control"" them.Also got an Echo Studio to try which complements the stereo pair of echos but it is also very difficult to control. The volume on the studio also pops to 10 at random moments and there's no way to turn it back down without using the buttons. So, not smart. Again, sound is great and better, if only by a small margin, than my discontinued Bose sound touch speakers. It also, doesn't drop out as often as they now do (the main reason to get something new), so I'm stuck.The Studio is going back due to the volume control issue, unfortunately.

It took 3 different one hour long phone calls to get this accomplished and I was told that the Echo Show would not pair with the speakers. What genius decided that it would be a good idea to make the speakers NOT compatible with the device they were sold to support?Then I ordered the Echo Link ($200) so that I could play music from Alexa through my home stereo. Two different one hour long phone calls later, this was accomplished. But there was about a .5 second delay through the Echo Link so the sound was terrible. (Do not recommend this setup.) Then I ordered two more Echo speakers which were delivered today. I was on the phone for 1 hour and 20 minutes, restarted mymodem twice and the tech could not simply add the two new speakers. Before I ended the call with tech support, I made sure to ask if the contents of the call would be recorded so that I did not have to start from the beginning in a few days when I get some more patience and decide to try tech support again. He assured me that was the case. A while later I got on my computer and decided to try to chat with tech support. Guess what? He tells me that he cannot access the results of the call. More frustration caused by the inept Amazon tech support crew. When the Echo speakers and sub are set up, they are decent speakers at a decent price. Keep in mind that I'm not an audiophile. The sub is required, in my opinion, for good sound. I really like being able to say Alexa, play music, and have music come on in my house. BUT, I am beginning to question if dealing with the hassle of multiple lengthy calls to tech support just to get the devices set up is worth the trouble when I could just grab the remote for my stereo system and hit the power button instead. And it appears that the chat feature with tech support is just as bad as a phone call with tech support. I'm chatting with the 4th person in one chat session and she is a member with Amazon Leadership. WOW! She told me that she understands and the she is here to help. My response was (The scariest words you will ever hear are ""I'm with the government and I'm here to help"". We may need to amend that to ""I'm with one of the largest corporations in the world and I'm here to help"".) She did not respond to that. Now she tells me that the two new speakers cannot be added to the existing speakers, which contradicts what I was told when I originally asked about adding speakers to the system. If it was common knowledge among Amazon tech support agents that only two speakers couple be paired with each other then why did they spend hours on the phone/chat with me trying to accomplish this task? I guess I need to hang on to all my Amazon boxes in case I get fed up and decide to send all this stuff back. What a mess. And just in case anyone from Amazon happens to read this, I requested a copy of the transcript of my tech support chat so I will gladly send to you if you'd like to read it.",02-10-2024,02-10-2024

I've now dropped my review from the original 4 stars down to 1 star. I'm at the point of regretting making the purchase of two of these.This was my first experience owning an Amazon Echo. Maybe if I had experienced one of the earlier models that actually worked, I would have a better impression, but this model really is a piece of crap. The micrphone hardly ever works right. When it does actually hear you speaking to it, it often misunderstands what you're saying. Most of the time, we have trouble getting it to work because it won't even stay connected to the wifi.Out of frustration, I decided to run a test. I purchased some of the Google Nest devices and hooked those up in the same rooms as the Amazon Echo devices. When the Echo devices misunderstand what we're saying, we try with the Google Nest devices and they work flawlessly.For the last two days, every single time we talk to Alexa, her response is that she can't understand because she isn't connected to the internet. Every time we get that response from Alexa, we turn to the Google Nest and it works perfectly. Every single time the Amazon Echo fails us, the Google Nest steps up to the plate and performs exactly how you want it to.I really have deep regrets about purchasing these Amazon Echo devices. I've seen other reviews that say how much better the older models of the Echo are and how much better they perform. It's a shame we had the bad luck of trying the Echo for the first time on a model that is truly a lemon, because it burned us out on the whole Echo product line and sent us running for the competition.If we continue to have the problems with our Echo devices, I'll probably just go ahead and disconnect them and see if I can get some of my money back by selling them on Ebay or something. I wish I had just purchased the Google Nest originally and never had to deal with all of the issues with this Echo. Also, the Google Nest costs much less than this garbage. How does that happen. It costs like 1/3 the price and works flawlessly? Why can't Amazon make their product as well as Google makes theirs? I don't know. Just super unhappy with these Echo devices right now.[End Edit][Original Review]I wanted to get some Echo devices for my kids for Christmas. Target had the best price with a pre-black friday sale on the 4th gen Echo with premium sound, but that's because they were actually shipping the lower cost Echo while charging for the Echo with premium sound. After straightening that whole mess out and deciding that I couldn't trust Target to not try to cheat me, I purchased the 4th gen Echo devices straight from Amazon.The sound is pretty good, but I have a lot of hearing loss, so I'm not actually a very good judge on that. But to a guy who is half deaf, they sound ok.My biggest problem is that I have to say something to Alexa usually 2-3 times before she responds. When I say ""Alexa..."" the light ring at the base lights up, so I know the Echo is awake and listening, but simple commands like ""Alexa, turn on the lamp"" are met with stone cold silence and have to be repeated a couple of times before Alexa acts or responds. I guess the technology for this just isn't where I thought it was when we purchased these.At least once a day, both of my Echo devices tell me they can't turn a light on/off because they can't find the device, which starts a lengthy process of my trying to get the Echo to re-recognize the smart home plug that we previously had configured. Why does the Echo randomly forget the smart home devices that have been installed? I'm still trying to figure that out.The Echo devices also randomly lose the wifi signal in our house frequently. In the first two weeks, I can count at least 7 times one or the other of our Echo devices could not connect to our wifi, while multiple computers, tablets, phones, and smart tvs were all connected to the wifi with ease, the Echoes were seeming to struggle to maintain a connection to the wifi.We were having fun with the ""kitty kitty"" skill you can download to have alexa play a sound of a kitten calling it's mommy. Our cats went crazy trying to find the kitten. But of course, nothing is free in life, especially not when Jeff Bezos feels he can squeeze another penny into his pocket, so Alexa wants to run down a lengthy list of other sound options for the ""kitty kitty"" that can be purchased. If you don't want to listen to this long listen of purchase options, you can say ""Alexa stop"" or ""Alexa no thank you"", but either way, if you don't buy one of the add ons, Alexa gets a serious attitude in the tone of her voice to let you know she disapproves of your decision to not throw your money at Jeff Bezos.It's not just with the ""kitty kitty"" skill thing either. There have been several occasions when Alexa had such a tone in her voice that it made me stop and turn to look at the Echo. I would not be surprised if the blue light ring at the base was pulsating in a blood red color.Just based on all the hype about these, I seriously expected better performance from them, so I was really disappointed. With the problems we have using these 4th gen echo devices, I can't even imagine how much it was a problem with the 1st gen devices. Knowing what I know now, I would probably not buy these again or recommend them to anyone else. I think that maybe future versions will work a little better and not require you to repeat commands to Alexa so often. But if Alexa doesn't lose her attitude, I expect that by the time 8th gen devices roll out, Alexa will have the ability to hover in the air while spitting pea soup all over everything in the room and speak with a demonic voice as she stops asking you to buy add-ons and demand that you give all of your bank account and credit card info directly to Jeff Bezos.",01-14-2021,01-14-2021

Maybe I just got one a little towards the lemon side. It sits in the same exact spot my old cylinder style echo used to be but 70% of the time I have to repeat myself three times with my voice volume going up each time before it recognizes my voice. Once again it could be placement which is next to a couch arm and a wall, But my old cylinder style echo heard me 80% of the time instead of just 30% of the time like this unit. Nicely designed looks good integrated into my Alexa system basically easy when changing over. Except blink cameras, it randomly overtime would show up a different blink camera as new device discovered. I would have to say my favorite part is it doesn’t fall over like the cylinder when the cats rubs up against it. All in all the sound is decent or good enough for me, I am no audio file nut and listen to very little music, device looks good, and eventually does what I request of it. I do find all echo devices do have their strange quirks, which I don’t understand because I would think they all work off the same cloud and would use the same exact commands; that does not seem to be the situation at least not in my experience. Had an echo show five that I just traded in that constantly I needed to use different commands than any of my other devices. And this new echo device (4thGEN) for some reason decided that it will not work with my living room light unless I specify in the command “living room light”even though the light is in Alex App as just living room and the old tower echo device used to accept just the word “living room off/on”, took me a while to figure out what was going on and why the device was telling me “living room does not support this command”. Also constantly have problems with the play and pause fire TV command, after pausing when I use the play command it tends to change the TV into a search mode. I find it just easier to manually play and pause. And the occasional changing of commands overtime is also quite annoying. Certain commands I used for months/years and suddenly one day they would not work and I had to figure out what the new command was, this is extremely annoying. Please stop doing this Amazon leave well enough alone.Well I realized I never hit submit on this review, now it’s approximately eight months later, and I can’t stand this thing, constantly have to repeat myself over and over again. Sometimes it doesn’t even do anything except the blue and green lights just keep spinning around like it’s trying to figure out what I just said. wish I never traded in my old tower version. What’s going to be the next shape so they can sell more but make no true improvements a pyramid, a rectangle, an octagon God only knows. Now almost all of my lights in the house need the word light said after them to work properly so now it’s no longer front porch off, now I have to say front porch light off. Soon I’m gonna have to read a novel to the thing to get it to do some thing probably give it GPS coordinates of the light so it will work. Very disappointed my sister has an Alexa and Google and she tells me she prefers the Google much better. Also since Amazon took over the blink cameras, love the cameras but the app with every update gets worse, for some reason with each update one click turns into two clicks next update those two clicks to change a setting has turned into three clicks or more to change a setting what sense is this. This little echo ball works so badly, it is literally sitting 2 feet from me on a table, that I give up and holler to the old Echo dots in the kitchen for my needs. May just give the Google device a try as my main device.",03-26-2023,03-26-2023

Speakers themselves are okay.,"I bought an Echo 4th gen and an Echo Dot (4th Gen) in a package.I've been using them for 9 months now. These devices do play music from Amazon Prime Music account but the Alexa software is pretty buggy.Example:For months I couldn't get the two paired Echo devices to play Amazon music (or anything else) on Everywhere group.Then recently I was able to get that to work, BUT Alexa would only play one song from Amazon music then shut all devices down.I made sure network connectivity was not the problem. Both Echo devicesare paired and connected to the same wi-fi network.My Everywhere Group includes both devices.I could play music all day long on a single device at a time.Today (9/29/2021) I found that if you start initially playing Amazon music on Everywhere, it will shut off all devices after one song, BUT, if you initially start playing NPR/Kuow (from iHeart Radio) on Everywhere, you can then switch to Amazon music and songs will continue to play.This is what I mean by ""buggy"".Now for the rest.The other Alexa features like Lists, Routines, Chore Chart (blueprint), Task Tracker (blueprint) are so far pretty useless.What I wanted to do was use Alexa to help us(two adults) manage our time, like keep track of chores, with daily reminders, and keep track of tasks lists for each of us.Alexa doesn't seem to be able to use more than a single ""list""or tracker and it better be for a single person.I created two lists (using Lists & Notes, not Blueprints), one a shopping list, one a to-do list.Alexa had trouble keeping these lists separated, and adding/removing items at least from voice commands.I also tried creating a couple of Skills using Chore Chart blueprint and Task List blueprint.These also did not work for multiple people, and you cannot edit the items without logging into the Blueprints web so it's not very useful for a daily Task List that needs to be dynamic.Bottom line, it has taken 9 months to get this far. I was willing to put some learning time in, but not have to take a class or hire a technician just to get things working.I find the Echo hardware are adequate speakers for me, but Alexa software is not.Amazon's online documentation is woefully inadequate, difficult to find and very general.I did not try the Help & Feedback from the iOS Alexa app since I find reading documentation on a phone screen difficult.The forums are sometimes helpful if you use suggestions cautiously.Ihave spent a lot of time trying to get Alexa features working, and my lack of success does not make me happy.I admit my expectations may have been too high.",09-29-2021,09-29-2021

The humidity sensors in my temperature sensors won't display. I also couldn't get the power monitoring functions of my smart plugs to display. I had to delete the units from the Echo Hub and add them back into my Smart Things hub.For example, without access to the light levels in the room, you can't really use the motion sensor to control the lamps. You have to limit them to certain times of day so they don't turn on when it is daytime. But then when it storms and the room is dark, the lamps won't light.

Also, the Echo's voice recognition feature works very well, and sound quality is great. But voice recognition was not the primary motivator in my case - the multi-room was. Hence the two stars.Amazon should either ensure partners clearly state that their device isn't tested/won't work in a multi-room setup, or ensure that ""Alexa-built in"" means multiroom will work. I am not happy about all the time I wasted, both on my own and with Samsung/Amazon support, to try and get this to work.

What little usefulness it has is just a hook to make you pay for and become reliant on amazon music unlimited. Unless you swallow that bait it is a poor and inconvenient option. Even if you can find enough “free with Prime” music that you want to listen to, it won’t let you add more than 20 songs to a playlist. Any function that doesn’t further Amazon’s ability to sell you more stuff or subscribe to more stuff, is just ignored and unaddressed.“Whole House Audio”??? That’s a joke. It won’t let you play your own music from your phone on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play radio apps on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play audio books on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play the audio from a Bluetooth-connected TV on the “everywhere group”. Basically it’s a novelty item that is WAY oversold as a whole house audio solution. It is only “whole house audio” for being tied to Amazon’s pay streaming music.If music is playing on one unit, and you ask it to continue playing the music on the “everywhere group”: First, it will tell you that you can’t play music on the “everywhere group” because music is already playing on another unit. But It’s not playing on another unit. It is playing on the unit you are talking to. So it will force you to stop playing the music and then make a new music request to be played on the everywhere group. I have yet to be able to get it to continue playing the same music it was originally playing on the everywhere group. Continuity is awful (non-existent). Amazon is primarily concerned with selling you the unlimited subscription, instead of responding to a reasonably foreseeable request in a manner that enhances your listening continuity as you move around the house.Let’s say you’re getting ready in the morning and you want Alexa to tell you the news. Don’t expect to able to move around from room to room because it will only play that news audio on one unit. Not on the everywhere group, or on another smaller group. If you move to a different room that hasanother unit, your only option is to replay the news from the very beginning again and listen to what you have listened to already over again.None of these problems are beyond the technical ability of the Echo units. Some of the problems are intentionally created obstacles just to try to force you into paying for unlimited. Others problems remain unaddressed because they wouldn’t help (or hurt) Amazon to sell you more “stuff”.So you’ve spent a few hundred dollars on echo units for around your house? Good luck with that. Don’t expect true whole house audio and don’t expect them to work together as a group of units. All you did was purchase the “gateway drug” for Amazon’s selling machine.",12-22-2021,12-22-2021

I also prefer the 360° sound from the echo plus. after going back-and-forth I’ve personally experienced the microphones on the echo plus pick up my voice better. in my opinion this new version just sounds a little bit louder with more bass even though they both have the exact same drivers with the exception of the new one having an extra tweeter which doesn’t really make a difference in the sound. I actually had to turn down the bass just a little because it sounded a little... messy. i’m not really sure why they completely changed the design and got rid of the 360° sound and made it a directional sound speaker instead. i’m a little confused. One more thing I noticed about the new speaker is when the volume goes up the bass goes down which is very common for all these speakers and most Bluetooth speakers but it seems especially evident in this newest version of the echo. they could’ve at least made the bluetooth option volume sync with your phone with this new version. and of course it wasn’t compatible to pair with my echo plus for stereo. ok i’m done.,10-23-2020,10-23-2020

THat happened for me on Beatles Revolution, which has a very distinct separation of instruments on left and right channels.Instead of being separated, one channel duplicated the sound in the other channel (but not vice versa).This is a clear problem with software that according to forums has existed since 2018 at least, and still persists to this day.Doing a stereo test track on the devices confirms it's a problem.Since the stereo on their echo show devices appears to be accurate, I suspect it's either a glitch or outright failure in the code used to separate the signals in pairing.The speakers sound good for the price, but if you want true stereo, you're better off buying a decent pair of speakers or buying a different device.",11-01-2023,11-01-2023

Voice recognition is a 50/50 toss-up, and while it's better at accurately recognizing words and phrases than other AI assistants, it still misses enough that important information doesn't get added to your to-do list or shopping list.I use it the most for timers, calendar reminders, task reminders, and adding things to my to-do list and shopping list hands off. Timers and task reminders work great; calendar reminders are awesome, but for some reason everything gets repeated twice even after having it set in the app to only repeat reminders once. The to-do list and shopping list feature works, but the integrations between different apps are really poor (my to-do list lets me have a dumping ground list for tasks added through the Alexa, but I have to manually sort and tag them later), and the Alexa app's features aren't strong enough that I'd be comfortable switching my lists to its platform for the ease of integration.We have two smart lights from Geeni that we use with it, and every second or third time we try to operate them through voice commands, the command fails in some way - the Echo doesn't respond even after listening to your request, or it says ""okay"" but doesn't actually operate the light until a few minutes or few tries later.We tried connecting it to our Firestick, but it was so non-functional we had a better experience just keeping them separate. HBO would routinely crash, or the sound would cut off of HBO streams, when the Echo was the speaker for the firestick; and the process of re-connecting the Echo after this happens, and clearing the Firestick app cache and relaunching things, etc. made the process miserable and unworkable.The app is very slow and hard to navigate - the paths to different features are hard to find, and you have to retrace your steps a lot to complete multiple complex actions.The audio quality is excellent, and I love using it for sleep ambience and music. However, it's very annoying to have to hear ads interfering with the experience of virtually any Alexa app you'll use, whether that's a small soundscape service or a major music platform. The best experience I have is connecting it to my phone via Bluetooth so I can play whatever I want without interruption, which is a pain, but at least then I haven't just paid for an Amazon product that still makes me listen to ads.Also, the fact that staff will have to listen to voice recordings to improve the quality of the products or that your speech is stored in the cloud at all is a huge privacy issue.",07-22-2021,07-22-2021

After they rang, I set another 30-minute timer (I know I nap quite a bit). However, after the new timer is set, the old timer kept ringing. So I said to Alexa with my dreamy eyes, ""Alexa, turn off the alarm"" to which Alexa replied, ""there is no active alarm.""Thinking that the 30-minute timer is canceled too, I told Alexa again, ""Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes."" It replied, ""Second alarm set for 30 minutes."" Frustrated, I then told Alexa to clear all timers and set just 1 alarm for 30 minutes, to which it replied, ""Third alarm set for 30 minutes.""Not wanting three alarms to go off one after another, I asked Alexa to clear all timers. Alexa then read to me, that I have 3 active timers set, with the FIRST timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, the SECOND timer set to 30 minutes X minutes X seconds remaining, the THIRD timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, which one did I want to cancel. I said ""all of them."" Alexa then said ""timer all of them"" was not found and then hung up on me. I then had to tell it to cancel my timers again.
