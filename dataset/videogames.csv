https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,It's...just another open world game...,"I could not wait for this game to come out.  They panned it as being the 1st real next gen game.  They told us it was going to be an amazing experience.  They told us it was going to have groundbreaking features!

Bunk!

Watch Dogs is what you get when GTA and Assassins Creed has a love child.  This game is good looking, some parts are fun, and the hacking is, in a way, different.  The problem is, you will quickly find yourself thinking, ""I've done this before.""

I really think someone had a big ""open world"" check list and decided to add everything in.  Racing...check!  Go shoot that guy...check!  Follow this guy around without being seen...check!  Go buy some guns and clothes you don't need...check!

Watch Dogs does not do enough to separate itself from the pack.  The hacking is okay but most of the time you are just hitting the same button over and over again.  The info you get from hacking gives life to the world but it's not enough to flush out the game.

One thing that might make or break this game for you are the stealth missions.  I don't mind a stealth mission if it can be either a stealth or a shoot out.  I'm not a fan of stealth missions where you fail if you are discovered.  There is always too much trial and error with little to no satisfaction at the end.  This game has a number of stealth missions.

The main character is cookie cutter.  Most of the supporting characters are more interesting and better acted than your character.  That wouldn't be a big issue if the story was edgy or fun.  Sadly it's neither of those things.

Overall, Watch Dogs is a great looking game that might be worth it if you REALLY like open world games.  Keep in mind, this is a good, not great, open world game.  If you are burned out on open world games, this game will not revive your desire to play one.  It gets old fast and the ""new"" things are not enough to make up for it's shortcomings.",05-27-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Hands on review - no spoilers,"Graphics 5/5  Actually looks like it was made for next generation consoles and looks just as pretty as Killzone. Nighttime looks significantly better than daytime Chicago.

AI 5/5  The AI is very very smart and it makes encounters very challenging and interesting.

Driving 3/5  Walking around on foot prevails the driving by a lot. As soon as you hop into a vehicle the cit seems to turn into a ghost town. I would have wished that the driving was more like GTA5 and not Saints row. Perhaps the driving isn't the best because Aiden always has his phone out.

The first thing I notice is that this game does require you to think! In every combat situation, running in guns a blazing will certainly find you in a bit of trouble. However, if you take the time to look around, everything can be hacked or booby-trapped. The combat in Watch Dogs has a great balance of run-n-gun, sneaking, sabotage and preplanning. Hacking is a boat load of fun and actually makes trying to be stealthy worth it.
I had played the original driver some many years ago when that came out and I was really looking forward to driving around and the car chases in this game. I had played Grand Theft Auto and had gotten into a few car chases in that game. This... is nothing like that. The cops are smart and significantly more skilled at hunting you down than in any other game I've played recently. I found myself hacking signs on the side of the road so they come to a crash, changing red lights and even parking and hiding in my own car to get away.
What can you really hack? Pretty much everything. Someone walks by you? Feel free to access their bank account through their phone. See a car you want? Unlock it and its yours! While wandering around you will also be notified of citizens that are in need of assistance and its up to you if you want to help or simply let it happen.
Overall I would say that this is the best game out there for the ps4 right now.",05-27-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Entertaining So Far,"By now I've completed enough hours of gameplay to get a good feel for the game, and I have to say that it's pretty good so far.  While playing I've noticed that the imprint of past Ubisoft games.  The visuals and character movements feel very much like Assassin's creed.  The characters movements are not as sophisticated as Assassins Creed's. You can climb small obstacles, but no buildings.
  I'm having a blast hacking the traffic lights and turning all sides green, but if you do it too much the cops will come after you.  It gives me a good laugh when I cause a pile up in the middle of the intersection. Speaking of cops, they are little smarter and therefor harder to get away from than in GTA games.  You can also, hack into cameras, which helps you move around an area.  This hack helps you move around during missions without getting noticed.  Watch Dogs is a stealth game, and it would be easier for you if you try to stay undetected.  I also found aiming easier than GTA too.  In Watch Dogs the dot is red when pointed at enemies, but in GTA it's white.  The red dot is so much easier to see, and therefor easier to aim.
  The game takes place in Chicago, and you play a hacker turned vigilante.  The city is large and well design. Unisoft did an excellent job with recreating the city of Chicago.  Some people are saying that they don't like the driving, but I really don't see anything bad about it. You can switch the view from first or third person.  Personally, I find it easier to drive using the first person perspective.  Yes, I can see how people get frustrated when trying to escape, but that's just smart AI chasing after you, not necessarily bad driving controls.
  I've completed the first act, and I've gotten a good feel for the characters and plot. There are five acts in all, which makes for a long game that will keep you busy for a long while.  Act one took me six to seven hours to complete. There are also tons of side quests, and mini games to complete on top of the action packed main campaign.
  Most of the time the supporting characters are believable, but a few small parts they had been a little flat.  The plot is energetic and suspenseful, and keeps you wanting to discover more.  Watch Dogs does a good job of keeping me at the edge of my seat, especially when I'm trying to escape.
  I will update my review as I play more of the game, but if you're on the fence trust me it's a buy you won't regret, especially if you like open world games like Gran Theft Auto.",05-27-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,1,"Boring game, bad characterization, outdated graphics.","I'm a very casual gamer, and bought Watch Dogs well after it had come out.  Based on what I read about the gameplay and the concept, I thought I'd love it.  Instead, I hated it so much I barely got through the first two hours of it.  I turned it off, ejected the disc, and traded it in.
The graphics are pretty shoddy in this day and age.  Hacking seems cool at first, but really all it consists of is pressing a button.  You can hack almost anything in the game, which quickly devolves into an odd sort of information overload, with the hackable device indicator popping up with every person walking by.  The driving mechanics are absolutely terrible, and it makes controlling vehicles an annoying chore.  On top of all that, the protagonist just isn't likable and is a very flat character.  I didn't read up on the ending, and I don't know how the story plays out in the game, but you quickly learn that the guy is mad because he hacked someone's bank account and that guy sent some baddies after him in return, killing his niece in the process.  Well, you started it bro.",10-24-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,Mixed bag of gameplay 3.5 stars,"This is one of those games that I missed when it originally came out, but I decided to try this game after finding it for under 20 bucks.  It is hard not to compare this game to the GTA series as it seems to incorporate some of those game play elements with some additions that make it something different.

I will say that some of the GTA like gameplay, such as the cop chases, seems to be a bit more difficult or not executed as smoothly.  I really didn't like the cop chasing element in this game at all.  To be fair though, this game focuses more on the electronic hacking aspect of the game more than the GTA style of gameplay.

There are also some quirky elements such as the virtual video games on the street and the weird trips that you take to drive over some flaming people.  The perk and ability system is also a cool addition to the gameplay although I found the ability tree a bit cluttered and harder to figure out than it should be.

The hacking part is fun for a time but does get a bit repetitive over time.  The main storyline is decent with some fun missions.  I did find the main character a bit conflicted as he was supposed to be a vigilante against crime yet does several criminal things.

There are lots of side quests but I personally think they are pretty much the same things over and over and I got bored with them pretty quickly.  I did find doing some things pretty difficult to figure out as it isn't always clear on what you needed to do to complete a side quest.

Climbing up and over things feel a bit clumsy to me as compared to other games I have recently played.  Graphics are decent for a game that is over 3 years old, although the graphics do seem to be a bit inconsistent at times.

Overall, I found this to be a mixed bag with some elements being fun and some just downright boring or poorly executed.  This game was alright but not nearly as fun as the GTA series.

I personally did not enjoy this game because:

1) The main character was very bland and boring. He didn't seem to react appropriately or have any sort of emotions displayed when things happened. He was VERY stoic which kind of bored me.

2) The fact he could use his smartphone to make specific manhole covers blow up out of the ground was kind of weird. There were other things he could use his phone to control that made you scratch your head like that too.

3) The story itself wasn't bad, but it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be believable or outlandish. There were times when it felt more like GTA, and times when it felt more like Saints Row. It just kept dipping back and forth into each one.",02-11-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Shame on Me,"Like most people, I shamelessly bashed this game because it didn't live up to expectations.  I played it on PS3 and hated the driving to give it a chance.  I judged it by comparing it to GTA5 instead of by its own design.  After playing Watch Dogs 2 and realizing how unique it was, I wanted to give this game another chance.  After playing it and beating it, I cant believe how wrong I was.

This game is simply amazing.  As improved as 2 is in terms of hacking, the original nails it in terms of tone and style.  It raises an issue rarely seen in games.  Honestly more games should delve into these underground themes.  I only wish this game explored more.

The story is about a vigilante hacker who is being blackmailed.  As you progress, you uncover a conspiracy involving prominent figures in the city.  At the same time, you are also being hunted by hitmen sent by them.  It feels like a modern day noir story with a little bit of Taken and Batman Begins sprinkled on top.  Without spoiling the story, you're basically a character with a particular set of skills who has to use his hacking, stealth, and combat abilities to infiltrate buildings and hideouts.  There are also many side activities to do along the way.  Some examples include random crimes, gang fights, contracts, and psychedelic drugs that make the character hallucinate.  Other players can also invade your game.  Throughout playing you earn points to upgrade your abilities.  I like how the more crime events you intervene in, the higher your vigilante reputation is with the people.

The game borrows a lot from the GTA franchise, but puts another spin on the gameplay experience that makes it unique. I said the driving was bad on PS3, but found it to be not that big of a deal when trying on PS4.  I think I played the game the first time looking for faults without trying to see the good.  The PS3 version I remember had terrible water effects.  On the PS4, it seemed fine which leads me to believe the difference between on PS3 and PS4 is like night and day.  I recommend playing on the current systems than last.  While both games let you shoot people for fun.  I complained that you couldn't randomly hit people.  Thats what you would do in GTA if you wanted to mess around.  In this game, you hack them and take their money and listen to their conversations to discover secrets within the city.  Its a different kind of messing around that I unfairly criticized.  If you play WD for what it is instead of comparing it to something like GTA, you will find it to be pretty original and lot of fun.

I really wish I gave this game more praise when it came out.  While Watch Dogs 2 is not a bad game, in fact its pretty good as well in that it explores more issues that are corrupt.  It just didn't have the tone I wanted.  While funny on most occasions, I would have liked the sequel to take what WD introduced and expand it a little further.  I should also mention that missions are not replayable in this game which is a real shame as some were really memorable.  There is no New Game Plus, but to the game's credit, there are still lots to do once the game is over.  While doing this could have been more of a retread, I feel the world created in this game still has more dark secrets yet to uncover.",01-24-2017

At the pub, you get a generic burger and fries; Watch Dogs is a lot like that- unmemorable but inoffensive.

Negative
- Main character Aiden Pearce is generic and surprisingly douchey. He spends the whole game weirdly obsessed with his sister and grumbling to himself in generic monologues (his sister in the original script was his wife, but was changed at the last minute). The supporting cast, while not all that memorable, is usually way more interesting than Aiden at any given moment.
- Ubisoft's typical open world gameplay mechanics (find beacon, capture beacon) are pretty stale at this point. The two big additions to the format are only used in interesting ways a handful of times.
- The story is forgettable, the ending pretty stupid.
- The game's extra collectibles, which are weird 'home invasion' snippets, a side quest involving a murderer, and another sidequest involving a sex trafficking ring, go absolutely nowhere, leading to bland chase missions that are no different from regular story missions.
- The 'home invasions' are terrible. They all come across as either disgusting or insulting. Ubisoft tows the line between 'edgy' and 'humorous' with the grace of a capybara on a pogo stick.
- Pursuer AI while driving is either ridiculous or glitched. I find I can escape every single chase mission by jumping on a boat.
- The hacking minigame gets really, really monotonous.
- Graphics aren't bad but fall well short of Ubisoft's E3 showings.
- Melee combat is ridiculous. Aiden gets a one-hit-kill baton move that works on almost everything. While in the animation, he's invincible and even recovers health, making it pretty viable to just run right up on guys and hit them.
- Ubisoft thinks we're idiots because Aiden's son's gravestone gives us the year of his birth and year of his death, but then adds his age to the bottom in a huge font to make sure we all know the kid is x years old. C'mon, Ubisoft.
- Aiden's 'homes' are useless. Never felt the need to drive back to his apartment.
- The story's plausibility sometimes goes completely in the dumpster depending on your moral choices. Chicago's news networks wonder who the 'vigilante' is while the average pedestrian may walk right up to you and snap a photo saying, ""Hey, it's the vigilante!""

Neutral
- Gunplay is entirely serviceable. Nothing wrong with shooting stuff.
- Driving is fine.
- Difficulty is in the right place.
- Tons of content, infinite amounts of 'vigilante' instances where you help people. I ignored them after the first ten. The 'home invasions' give you the impression that everyone sucks, so you stop to care.

Good
- Chicago in this game sometimes has an interesting similarity to real world Chicago. Landmarks in particular look similar to the real thing.
- Hacking stuff while driving is sometimes cool. You have the ability to hack helicopters out of the sky, and it looks awesome, but you may only do it once and not for practicality's sake (getting the right angle with your perspective behind the wheel is pretty tricky).
- Alternate ways to do missions using hacking only is actually viable in a couple spots. Multiple ways to do missions is sometimes fun, but cheesing motorcycles or vehicles into key areas before a mission starts will only work once; if you respawn, Chicago's crime statistics manifest themselves and your vehicle mysteriously vanishes.
- The online makes for a fun distraction every once in awhile. I played with it off.",08-09-2016

It seems like a really cool game - Hacking into all of the cTos systems and hacking into pedestrians cellphones . I find it interesting just roaming around seeing what they're convicted of what their occupation is or their secrets  Im still getting used to everything within the game but it seems alright for now . Im more of a GTA5 girl so this is kindve new for me . The driving and shooting controls are about the same I believe . However driving in this game sucks . Reminds me back to where I use to play True Crimes NYC on PS2 - the way the driving is is just the same . Of course because they're both made by UbiSoft . I hate their driving (it seems like everything just bounces off of each other like it's not quite as realistic to GTA5 driving) .

There are tons of other games on the market that will be a much better experience, so even at a deeply discounted price you really should just avoid this one. Even the DLC for this title is lackluster.

the game is pretty broke on PC, so this is my only option.  super fun to get into.  i'm a big fan of the stealth genre, and it's great fun to scope out hideouts, then go around just silently murdering dudes until they're all dead.  the skill tree does a good job of motivating you to finish up the side stuff so you can murder dudes in all sorts of creative ways.

the story is pretty good.  nerdcubed did a pretty good review on youtube and he's totally right, the character development is AWFUL, but whatever.  i'm not really all that concerned with a characters motivation.  just gimme the tools to stealth the hell out of everyone.

getting invaded sucks especially when tracking a dude down because everybody cheats and somehow manages to phase through the wall.  one of the many reasons multiplayer is not for me.

i never noticed any bugs (other than cheatie cheatertons in mp), and the game might have frozen once or twice, but nothing to get overly upsetti spaghetti about.

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,Surprisingly Enjoyable,"I didn't expect to like this game, but this game has been a revelation to me.  I have put in hours and hours so far -- and most of it has been enjoyable.  What I didn't like so far has been the seamless ""multiplayer"" intrusions.  They have served more as a distraction than an addition in my honest opinion.  Luckily, you can turn it off which helps you concentrate on the game itself and the mini-games and side missions and you don't have to constantly worry about the outside distractions.

The presentation is top-notch, and gameplay as well.  The gameplay is a bit of Far Cry, Assassin's Creed and Splinter Cell put in the not-too-far future (I think).  Unlike Grand Theft Auto and more in line with Infamous, the city is alive and reactive.  There are street musicians and people randomly taking pictures and selfies near Chicago's landmarks and such.  The dialogue of the NPCs ultimately do go full-circle and gets repetitive.
The plot of the game is definitely something predictable, but the secondary characters are interesting, far more interesting than Aiden Pierce.  They have fallible and disturbing backgrounds.

Despite some of the criticism of the side-missions and mini-games, some of them are actually enjoyable.  Some of my favorites are:

-the chess mini-game.  not overly difficult, but it's definitely relaxing.
-the NVZN mini-game. again, same as above.
-the criminal convoy side missions. although the earlier ones are relatively easy, it does get difficult as you proceed up the ladder.
-the getaway side missions.  nothing like seeing some of the craziness that happens with blockers and road spikes that can cause massive collisions with enemy cars in pursuit.
-the gang hideout side missions.  they actually include lots of strategic elements as you need to plan your attack and make adjustments accordingly.

One last criticism is the instant fail of the primary missions (mostly).  It gets annoying after a while.  These primary missions should permit you to attack the mission as you see fit, particularly when the mission suggests it.

Overall, this game has been surprisingly enjoyable for me.",02-05-2016

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Loads of fun,"I've already reviewed the PS3 version of ""Watchdogs"", but I had to give it a one star rating because of was full of bugs that made the game crash and erase my save data. Now I've played the PS4 version and am happy to say I had a lot more fun and really enjoyed it.

Watchdogs is an open world game set in a major city, with a lot of driving, so it's a lot like Grand Theft Auto, but with added technology. The hero Aiden, can ""tune into"" (or hack) nearly anything he passes in the city, of Chicago, where the game takes place, such as hacking traffic lights to change them, hacking people's private phone calls as they walk past, hacking garage doors to open them, hacking security cameras to spy on things, and so on. Most of the plot involves crime and revenge, and Aiden has to spend a lot of time chasing and fighting. Gameplay centres on the following:

Car driving, and chases. There is a LOT of driving in this game. Aiden can pick up (or steal) any car in the game and start driving it. There are many missions that require you to race your way around the streets of Chicago, chasing villains or trying to escape from police. Unlike GTA, it is almost impossible to wreck an enemies car out of brute force, they seem indestructible. Instead you have to utilise hacks to trap them. This can be fun, as you try and raise bollards or change traffic lights at the key moment to take out a speeding enemy vehicle.
Stealth - Because Aiden can hack security cameras, a lot of missions involve infiltration into enemy strongholds, and Aiden can use security camera views to spot where people are patrolling and avoid them or do sneak attacks to kill them. This can be a lot of fun too, as long as you have patience.
All-out fighting. Aiden has a lot of guns, so if stealth fails you can go for full on weapon assault although this is very difficult to win as you will always be massively outnumbered. However the game lets you decide what to do.

A lot of the game is made up of side missions that are totally optional, but doing them doubles the length of the game and they are always entertaining and/or challenging. The main missions get more and more difficult, so the side missions make for good practice. You'll come up with lots of strategies that work for you. The city of Chicago is huge and realistic, and new side missions seem to carry on spawning forever, so potentially you could play this game for a very long time! I had great fun playing Watchdogs on the PS4, although I was bracing myself for another disappointment after the spectacular failure of the PS3 version, but I am please to report I played all the way to the end and had a great time",10-15-2015

What is really cool is these Mini-Games like the Hell one, the exciting realistic combat, being able to skip to destinations mostly, and the well done story and perfect graphics. My favorite parts were going across the river when all the gansters were chasing me and sniping them from like a mile away and being able to order a car (just the one, handling issues) from the mechanic except when on a mission or you fail a mission and it takes it away so you have to exit the mission for it back.",09-27-2015

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,Great first entry,"Late to the game but that just meant I got to play it after all the bugs were patched. I know a lot of people felt the game didn't live up to the graphical promise made when it was first announced but this is still a great looking game. For a brand new IP that Ubisoft wants to compete with the likes of GTA, I think this was a great starting point. The story was good, the characters were interesting, the game world was large, varied, and interesting. The gunplay functioned well. The stealth mechanics functioned well. The side content was fun. The hacking was their niche mechanic and the big draw and worked but can use improvement, especially when driving. In my opinion the driving mechanics were the weakest gameplay aspect and took awhile to get the hang of but they were still better than the driving in games like Sleeping Dogs and Just Cause 2...driving in those games was absolutely horrible in my opinion. Even though Chicago has the L-Train, I just never saw any reason to use it to get around so that was kind of a wasted element...but then again the subway in Los Santos in GTA5 was basically worthless as well. All in all, this was a great game that I  played about 40-50 hours total and completed just about everything. If they can improve on what they have built then future installments can rival GTA.",09-21-2015

I had gotten it since I was going to be going out of town to my Aunt's house, who doesn't have great internet(or really any at all).

My mom said I could take it with me since we'd be there for a long time. I never ONCE turned on the PS3 or used any other games what so ever. I love this game so much, it's one of the best open world games I've played in a long time. At one point I was just like to hell with the story! My mom, dad, aunt, just everyone in my family that was there started playing. We just had a ton of fun driving around, since none of use were any good at it. The story is okay, could had been better. But it's a ton of fun I honestly which some of the Assassin's Creed games were like this.
I hope Ubisoft makes another Watch Dogs, just even for the fact I can just drive around blowing stuff up.

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,The answer to cleaning up Washington?,"Pretty simple to review this game. It is Ubi Soft. The company that made Far Cry 4, which I consider to be one of the best games of all time. In fact you will definitely see the influences of the Far Cry programmers on this game. Remember the radio towers in Far Cry? Well they are back again! The graphics might be just a little less polished than Far Cry 4 but come very close to being as impressive. The concept was disturbing. Stealing from others without any regard as to how those consequences will affect others was painful to get through because it reminded me too much of the current administration in Washington. Hey now that's an idea why doesn't the president and members of Congress play this game where they pretend to be crooks and pretend to destroy people's lives instead of actually stealing money from the middle class and destroying the livelihood of others.",07-20-2015

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,2,Would have been four-stars if driving was improved,"Pros:

- This is a decent free-roaming game. You really feel like you are on the streets of Chicago. Although you can't go in buildings unless it's required for a mission and you can't clear small obstacles unless they are programmed to be climbable.

- The theme is quite unique and very original. Hacking through an imposed security grid (primarily through security cameras) is a nice change of pace from the usual shoot, smash, and grab vigilante games.

- Hacking ctOS centers and taking down crime gangs was fun. Some of the side missions (like playing chess) didn't appeal to me but it's nice that they included some diverse content.

Cons:

- Driving is the deal-breaker on this one. Vehicles are difficult to control even with routine driving and damn near impossible with high-speed chases. And many of the episodes indeed require high-speed chases. Cars drive like there is some serious play in the wheel and steering is too sensitive on the PS4 controller with no way to adjust it (like with X-axis sensitivity). Of course, your enemies all drive perfectly. And the police cars defy all laws of physics as they catch up and surround you when you're doing 110 mph.  Had the developers either omitted driving sequences from the game or made controlling the vehicles more manageable then this would be a four-star game. All they had to do was to make steering sensitivity adjustable (or make the driving by the police a little less God-like).

- Cannot explicitly save and since the campaign sequence is linear, you cannot go back to a mission or skip it for later. YouTubes on this game aren't great because contributors couldn't save and go back once they had perfected a mission. They had to do some serious editing or play the game all the way through again.

- You can't jump. You can climb boxes but you can't jump over many obstacles or make the 3 foot leap from a boat to the dock.

- You can't shoot from you car (but the cops chasing you sure can!)

- The last mission is particularly frustrating. You secure a fast car, but after a cut-scene the game takes it away from you and you have to steal whatever's available. You start at night so you can use blackout, but also after the cut-scene it's suddenly broad daylight. And I get it that my archenemy is jamming the city as I try to complete the mission, but how does he blur my vision. I'm a human with uncorrected vision and now he's got some ability to impair my eyesight from miles away with a mouse click. The developers wanted to make it difficult so instead of adding content, they just added nonsensical constraints to the gameplay. They were probably behind schedule and over-budget by that point.

- Another nuisance is bystanders yelling at you for walking too close to them on the sidewalks or driving normally in their proximity. After almost a hundred crime alerts where you have saved citizens' lives they still shout profanities at you. This gets old after 40 hours into the game. Driving a car is hard enough without the hate and discontent from the peanut gallery.",05-31-2015

However, once you get past the first two acts, it starts to get very repetitive and kind of dull. It's a very standard third-person action/shooter. The hacking element is cool, but gets old really quickly. If you've played any of the recent entries in the Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row series, than there really isn't a whole lot that Watch Dogs has to offer you.

All the Negative reviewers are comparing this game to GTA V. Well this game isn't GTA V. This game has a very open world of Chicago and Ubisoft did a great job capturing the city of Chicago. The freedom to roam and hack anything electronic is what makes this game great, the cop chases are fun because you have the ability to hack street lights and others things to interfere with cops. I had fun with online matchmaking when trying to hide from other hackers(online players) or trying to find the hackers. There is also other online matching making options like racing, decryption, etc. The story is also good, it's a revenge story of Aiden Pearce trying to find the man responsible for the death of his niece. If this game was released before GTA V everyone would be praising this game, the game was delayed so that did affect the reviews of this game. I can't wait for Watch Dogs 2.

Pros:

This and battlefield 4 were the best looking games at the time of their release in my opinion.
I was extremely disappointed that ubisoft downgraded the graphics last minute, especially with so much hype behind it.
I started playing this game expecting a gta clone and nothing more.
In reality,  the only real similarities between the two are carjacking, shooting and avoiding cops.
The missions play out entirely different,  there are plenty of side missions to keep you busy hours after completion, and the game while not the graphical jewel we were promised, still holds up nicely.
The music selection is different than I'm used to but nice, the cars aren't licensed but I didn't even care since they look real enough anyway.
The controls are similar to many sandbox games.
Hacking different devices brings up random character information for npcs around the city, which can provide humor.
The explosions are awesome and hacking into gas lines is fun as it can propel your car or those chasing you high into the air or blow you up entirely.
Certain side missions can get awfully repetitive,  so in retrospect, maybe I should've done them as I played the main game.
Instead I waited til I passed the main missions which made the game seem shorter.
The dlc for this is pretty good too.
Overall I was pleased with this purchase.

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,"That's goading at best, heavily influencing at worst","This game was highly underrated. What it lacks in personality, it more than makes up for in ambition. It also just misses the mark on what could have been some sharp social observation, satire, commentary, etc. Let's start there, since that could have been the game's signature.

Watch Dogs pursues surveillance aggressively, but doesn't quite know what to do with the data. Even as an open-book, form-your-own-opinion concept it fumbles in providing you with enough real choices to spy or not to spy and where to draw the line. I could choose note to spy on perfectly normal people in their homes, but it's a mission or missions and there's a reward at the end only achievable one way. That's goading at best, heavily influencing at worst. It also fumbles a prime opportunity to geo-code and show realistic salary data for the people on the street. I was expecting to see high-end jobs in the wealthier parts of town, and low-end and joblessness in poorer parts. But it's all a random mishmash of a world where salaries are all over the place and unrealistic, and everyone is employed. Show me the world where people are struggling to get by when 2 miles north they're living it up. Make my choices harder by showing me what I'm stealing from these people - their savings, their 401k, a trust fund, lottery winnings? These things could make huge differences, but instead every target's just as ripe as the last.

The game gets a lot of the rest right, despite underwhelming reviews. Graphics are solid on PS4. Voice acting is well done. Gameplay is fluid and fun with the gadgets and hacking. Tens of hours of play, especially with the side missions. The story is disappointingly generic, drawing on some worn paths before it in film and games. But it is well told with some memorable game moments and cinematics. And arguably MUCH better driving mechanics than GTAV. A bargain for $19.99.",05-01-2015

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,Poorly designed game play,"The style is that of Grand Theft Auto, but very badly designed.  It does have GTA quality graphics, and the main plot line is pretty cool, but the problems with the game FAR outweigh the positive aspects.
The first problem is the vehicle control system.  When you're driving one direction it's fine, controlled exactly like GTA, but god help you if you need to do a 3 or more point turn.  The left/right vehicle controls are relative to the direction the vehicle is facing, meaning they're reversed when you back up, and they don't change when the camera rotates around the car.  The real problem with this is the really dumb logic they put into the camera.  Unlike GTA which forces you to move the camera by hand in these situations and provides a button to quickly reverse the view to look behind you (useful for checking if someone's following you), the camera automatically tries to rotate to look behind you as soon as you start backing up and has to be fought to keep a consistent view.  The camera drifts slowly to reach the reverse perspective as well, so it's mostly useless if you're doing a 3 or more point turn to turn around in a tight space without busting up your vehicle.  It also causes problems if you want to rotate the camera to look at something while you're moving.  Most video games keep the controls relative to the camera in this regard, much like shooters do, but in Watchdogs you'll end up driving off the road until you get rid of the muscle memory associated with controlling your vehicle based on what you see.
The second problem is the mini-games.  In GTA and similar games the minigames at least have some cursory relationship to the main game play.  Racing challenges, fights, side quests, etc.  It's the rare thing to find a minigame like a betting minigame where you play poker or something.  Watchdogs has no minigames that are relevant to the story.  The ""minigames"" are broken up into 3 types: sub-missions, challenge games, and weird old-school arcade style games.  The sub-missions are basically what all the minigames are in GTA like games, a randomly generated mission from a variety of racing, gun fighting, etc possible missions.  They come in 3 varieties that slightly change what the possible missions are about (chase down a guy or guys in cars, sneak/kill your way into a fortified location and knock out a gang leader, or a solo timed racing mission from a set of various types). The challenge missions are strange, only mildly fun, and have even less to do with the actual game.  These are things like: a betting minigame where you play Texas Hold'em against 3 computer players, use a slot machine, or a play a find-the-ball cup game; a chess minigame where you're given a chess board setup with a fixed end game and you have to either survive for a number of rounds or checkmate the opponent in a number of rounds; a drinking game where you have to move one or more cursors to either navigate over some icons and press the appropriate button, or keep some cursors within a bounding circle for a fixed amount of time.  The third type is the dumbest, most pointless, and the least fun of he minigames, the ones that are loosely based on retro style video games.  These aren't like some games have where your character reaches a computer or arcade machine and starts actually playing a retro video game, these are your character doing things like having to shoot a bunch of 8-bit graphics aliens coming out of portals using special 8-bit graphics guns, or run around the environment to collect a bunch of 8-bit graphics coins while avoiding 8-bit graphics skulls in as little time as possible (the coins and skulls are the size of your character).
The third problem is the online aspects of the game.  There is no way to turn off the online parts of the game.  You can do online missions that allow you to race against, hack, or trail another player, selecting whether you're auto-matched or going against a friend.  The really annoying part though is that you are also always available to be auto-matched by some other player looking for a hacking mission. The racing mission requires you to actually agree to it and moves you to a fixed place for the race, so it's of minimal consequence unless you choose to do it.  The tracking missions just move you to the vicinity of an unaware player who's going about their business and ask you to first profile the player to identify them and then watch them either in person or through cameras for some fixed time without them profiling you.  There's no detriment to the player so it's non-disruptive to their game play.  The hacking however has a negative overall online score impact for the losing player (higher overall scores unlock some things in the game) so it requires your immediate attention once it starts.  As the player initiating the hacking, you agreed to stop whatever you were doing and start the hacking competition (profile the target, observe them briefly, and then ""hack"" them by staying within a circular area that shrinks as the hack gets closer to finishing without being found and killed by the player being hacked).  The player being hacked never agreed to anything though, they're likely in the middle of collecting something, unlocking something, or between minigame rounds when drop in and force them to drop whatever they're doing to find you (or just wait for the 2-3 minutes it takes for the hack to finish successfully with no intervention).  Missions and active minigames at least can't be interrupted in this way, but when you spend 5 minutes climbing, crawling, running, and hacking to reach a difficult place in order to open a door or unlock a ctOS tower and then get interrupted by someone in the general vicinity starting to hack you (blocking you from interacting with objects in the meantime), it gets annoying.
The fourth problem is the control system in general.  Profiling is like detective mode was in the Batman: Arkham Asylum game; there's no reason it should ever be off.  You have to have profiling enabled to hack anyone or see anything about them, it's largely necessary to locate and use cameras and other environmental devices that form the very basis of the game, and it's required to see the transmission path back to the first hackable junction box for unlocking some doors and other things.  Someone had the bright idea to enable/disable this mode using a tap of the square button.  Because of it's relationship to hacking, they decided pressing and holding the square button is how you hack things.  The time it takes to hack things (how long you hold the button down) varies quite a bit depending on whether you're just trying to hack a camera, rob someone of their money, or spy on people in an apartment through a junction box.  It becomes really easy to press the square button for slightly too short of a time to hack a camera quickly when you're doing one of the minigames or sidequests that's time limited, and end up having it registered as toggling profiling mode.  To make matters worse, there's no HUD indicator of whether profiling mode is enabled or not.  If you're running through a secluded area with limited things that can be hacked and looking for the difficult to find camera so you can reach a box that needs to be hacked, you can end up with the profiling disabled and missing the camera repeatedly until you realize and turn profiling back on.",04-07-2015

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,"Fun, but only ""meh""","Just like soooo many others, I was excited when I heard this was on the horizon as a next generation game.  It looked fun, sounded cutting edge, and I thought for sure an open world hack-a-thon was going to be the best thing like, ever.  Oh, how far this hyped game has fallen.

Pros:
-While the graphics weren't as mind blowing as they seemed in the previews, they are still pretty good.
-Chicago, where the game takes place, seems vibrant enough on the surface.  Changing weather, citizens going about their lives, busy traffic.
-Hacking mechanic.  While sorely underutilized, I still found it fun.  Most of the puzzles were fairly simple, but there were two that drove me insane (in a fun way).
-Jordi.  Probably more memorable than Aiden.  He was a good side character.
-TBone and Clara.  Also good side characters.  I felt more for them than I did Aiden.
-The music.  A great soundtrack complemented missions.  And the showdown at TBone's?  Loved it.
-The open world.  Chicago felt huge.  Without fast traveling to hideouts, trekking from one side to another actually took time.  And you could have a bit of mischievous fun along the way.
-Sometimes having the option to take people out by hacking the surroundings.  This was disappointingly under played.  I wanted this game to be all about hacking and stealth.

Cons:
-Aiden is a pretty flat character.  He's always brooding and...moody.  I get he has a past, but come on.  No character development.  I really wanted to like this Vigilante persona, a guy who had a cool trench coat and wears a mask.  Alas, there wasn't much personality there to like.
-Conflicting interests.  Aiden is supposed to be played as this good guy Vigilante out for justice.  Well, you could have fooled me.  You hack citizens to steal their money, songs, eavesdrop, spy, steal cars...Hacking for essentials, like security keys, is one thing.  But I found stealing a bit out of touch with what his character stood for.
-Too much a shooter game.  I expected to be able to get through missions by a combo of stealth and hacking.  80% of the time it ended guns blazing and I had very little choice in the matter.  The only non-violent missions were hacking the ctOS locations to gain access to a certain part of the city (of course, you have a choice to be violent).  What's a game about a justice seeking vigilante hacker if the objective is to shoot and kill?
-Take downs vs. kill.  It made very little sense, if any, to have to kill in some missions and find ways to ONLY take down in others.  Random missions where you could only take down targets was very obnoxious when the game is very ""shoot em' up"" oriented.  I liked the take down missions, it went well with the premise, but mixing it up with shooting and killing was senseless.
-Cops.  My god did this annoy me.  They could punch, run me over, and were annoyingly accurate with tailing me.  The free for all with the cops was beyond unrealistic, it was just silly.  I did like taking them out using the hacking mechanic, at least.  Oh, and magically escaping by boat.  Which also didn't make sense.
-Sketchy stealth.  In restricted areas I could effectively hide and stealth around.  In regular areas Aiden kept popping back up like a fricken whack-a-mole.  Getting killed in the process.
-My final gripe is the silly mini-games and repetive side missions.  Boring as all get out after the first 3 times or so.
-Just something that struck me as odd, but people on the street constantly spotted Aiden as the vigilante.  Yet, his sister was clueless and so are the baddies you come across during the act where you infiltrate using someone else's identity.

All in all, it wasn't a horrible game.  The campaign story was all right, I just wish Aiden had more development.  It would've been great to have a Robin Hood side to Aiden, rob from the rich and give to the countless hobos you come across.  Graphically, it was well designed.  The mechanics were 'meh' at times, yet I still had fun with the hack/stealth approach when it was available.  If playing only the campaign, you save yourself a lot of repetition and disappointment.  Lengthy side missions were unrewarding (so many missed opportunities here).  I feel the game was worth the $25 I paid for it...had I paid more I would've felt much worse about this game.",01-14-2015

I play them almost exclusively, with some FPS thrown in here and there for some diversity.  I enjoy the freedom of open worlds, with the weight of decisions falling on your shoulders.  Games like Dragon Age, Skyrim, Fallout, Diablo... those are my bread and butter.  However, I cannot get behind Watch_Dogs.  Like most others, I was so psyched when I heard about it at E3 a while back, and thought that it would be the coolest thing.  In my mind, however, they totally ruined what could have been a great concept.  My biggest issues are the controls.  The graphics are very nice, I have no issues there. I personally find the control scheme cumbersome... like a knock off of GTA or most other open world games.  Missions seem weird to me... like I'm told to knock out the leader of a gang ring, NOT kill him, but it doesn't tell me which one he is.  Either I just don't have a grasp on how the game is supposed to work, or it is just flawed this much.  Either way, I am glad that I only paid $20 for it a while ago, because otherwise I would be very annoyed with the quality of this game.  It just doesn't float my boat.",01-07-2015

Its a free roam shooter.  It is a fun game but after a while I was getting sick of people invading my city.  I also wasn't a huge fan of how long it took to lose the cops.  The really cool feature in this was hacking into peoples phones and learning about them.

It was open world like most games, so I don't fault it that, but it seemed like this game was just created for money only. I say that because the open world doesn't even really fit the plot line of this. I mean, the open world didn't really enhance the story at all. It's like the main importance was the open world and the plot was just thrown in and wrapped around it.

Don't get me wrong. It's a fun game with good graphics and gameplay. I didn't have any problems with glitches or anything and the voice acting was good. there's nothing really ""wrong"" with the game other then it's just kind of bland as far as the plot goes.

I did not expect it to be so boring. Expected so much more especially after the delays in releasing this game.,12-29-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,Great game but somewhat disappointing,"The game is basically what it appeared to be when it was revealed at E3. It's a darker, more serious, hacker version of grand theft auto. The gameplay is good and fun but there's a few things that disappointed most people who've played this game. I'll detail them out here:

1. Graphics on PS4: when they first revealed this game, they showed it off on a very high end PC machine. Most people were expecting the same level of graphics on the PS4 because it was not made clear that the original gameplay was not on a console. I still think the graphics are good but clearly not as good the trailer. Graphics don't bother me that much though so this wasn't a deal breaker for me.

2. Driving mechanics: people were expecting realistic contols and feel for the vehicles and driving sections in the game. I couldn't care about this issue either.

3. No epic ending or lead into a bigger story: this is what bothered me. Most of the game centers around fairly small time criminals on chicago. My hope was at some point (even if it was at the end, making sequel bait) the story would evolve into a grander scale plot that involves the government, other countries or something that affects alot more than just chicago. It didn't happen though and thats why at the end of my experience i was somewhat dissapointed.

So if all that doesnt bother you or if you just have an intrest in playing as a modern hacking vigilante thats somewhat like the punisher, then i give this game a strong recommendation.",12-29-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Five Stars,Nice product and service..very satisfied.,12-29-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Five Stars,"finally it is on discount, thank god",12-25-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,Pick it up cheap and it'll be fun,"This game came with a dump truck full of expectations when it debuted. It was billed as the smarter, stealthier, non-lethal-ier alternative to Grand Theft Auto. Plus, it was all set in real-life* Chicago. (*Most of the buildings are only ""close"" to their real counterparts, but it still looks close enough to be cool).

All of this sounds great! And the first few hours of the game are great! The driving wasn't so bad once you got used to it and the hacking allowed you to capture some control stations non lethally, which was lots of fun. Unfortunately, as the game went on you were essentially forced to use lethal force, because some of the missions had you going up against an army of guys in broad daylight with no shadows to sneak around in. Also, there's a hack where you can disable a helicopter temporarily, which is awesome when you're being pursued by police. Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to hack a helicopter if you're driving a car or boat because of the dim-witted camera angle. So to evade a helicopter you basically have to park your car, hack the helicopter, and then get back in and drive. None of it really mattered though, because to evade even the highest-level police chase all you have to do is go to the El and ride it out of the chase area. It works every time and it kind of makes the whole idea of police chases stupid and pointless.

Another major letdown was the utterly uninspiring and uninteresting story (maybe spoilers below). You're basically some small-time hacker who is out for revenge for your niece getting killed. Wait, niece? Not daughter? Not wife? Did they think that the whole ""getting revenge for your wife and kids getting killed"" angle was too played-out? I suppose it is sort of trite these days, but a niece just didn't have the same impact. I'm sure it could have, but the writing for this game was so bad I ended up just resenting Aiden's entire family. Shortly into the game you ""team up"" with another hacker named Clara, who is what somebody with a corner office and a certified pre-owned Lexus would envision a girl hacker to look like. Her character had the possibility to be interesting, but they don't develop her character at all past what you absolutely need to know to continue the storyline. They talk on the phone briefly and when they finally meet Aiden turns into a giant jerk and somehow tries to intimidate her, and is touching her neck and face and stuff. It felt really awkward and just left a bad taste in my mouth after that scene that carried on through the rest of the game. There's always some poorly-written sexual tension between them, but always just came off as Aiden being super-misogynistic. And not to turn this into a #gamergate review, but this game treats women like crap. There's a mission where you have to rescue some sort of ""lady of the night"" (thanks for rejecting my first and second draft of this review Amazon. What are you, Quakers?) from a house where ""ladies of the night"" live and work (again, thanks Amazon), and as soon as you bust up in there there's tons of nudity for the sake of nudity. By and large I don't care about nudity, but there was really no need for this scene or mission to even be in the game. You rescued the girl and then literally never saw or heard from her ever agin. She didn't become a playable character, or a character they ever expounded upon. She was basically a pair of breasts they put in the game to make it ""edgier"", and then got back to the hacking and explosions. So this is basically True Blood with hackers now. You eventually meet a Rob Zombie lookalike hacker and team up with him for a while, they even released some DLC so you can play as him if you want. He was equally uninteresting, so I skipped out on that DLC. Oh by the way, the main villain looks exactly like Tom Waits, which was unsettling. Anyway, at the end of the game Clara dies in a very...emotional(?)...shootout in the cemetery where your niece is buried (puke). I felt nothing when she died. Contrast that with me bawling my freaking eyes out at the end of Season 1 of The Walking Dead game from Telltale, and you see how utterly lacking a good story is in this game.

There are little mini-games you can play that are genuinely fun and are a welcome escape from the main storyline. Also, the random multiplayer aspect of the game is kind of cool. You go to start a mission and all of a sudden it says ""you are being hacked"" and you have to find and eliminate the hacker (which is another person playing the game). It's pretty fun, but I got into the habit of just pulling out the grenade launcher and whenever I saw the hacker blowing him/her up. It made it way too easy to never get hacked, but was still more satisfying than completing story missions.

The bottom line is, this game is decently fun provided you don't pay $60 for it.",12-24-2014

The game has mediocre missions with decent controls. The plot is intriguing, and the idea of hacking is also interesting. What the game suffers from ultimately is the lack of diversity. Also, the plot has a very anti-climatic ending - I didn't even realize I was on the final mission...

The online play is intriguing, but it didn't interest me beyond the times I was ""forced"" into it (before a mission sometimes an online match would start).

The world effects are really interesting - cans rolling down the street, the rain, the wind... I would like to see what Watch Dogs 2 would bring when they're not developing the technology to the make game and the game itself.

I've never really been into the more crime-focused games that have you playing as Mafia hoods or ghetto gangsters like in Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row; I briefly played Grand Theft Auto III back in the day, but grew frustrated with the crappy controls and gave-up on it. Red Dead Redemption fared much better with me, largely due to the western setting which had a greater appeal. Then came Watch Dogs, which immediately had my attention due to the interesting combination of hacking, surveillance, and vigilante justice which reminded me of a video game version of one of my favorite programs, Person of Interest. A lot of people were disappointed with Watch Dogs since it wasn't as revolutionary as apparently promised and because the graphics weren't as outstandingly gorgeous as they were in the first trailer. In my opinion, the graphics were just fine and the game itself was still a lot of fun...a tad repetitive at times, but still a very enjoyable experience.

The main character, an outlaw hacker named Aiden Pearce, is on a quest for vengeance to hunt down the criminals who tried to kill him but ended up killing his 6 year old niece instead. While doing what he can to make sure his younger sister and nephew remain safe, Aiden dives into the criminal underworld to find his niece's killers, normally running into and causing a lot of additional problems along the way. The story wasn't as deep or emotional as something out of Metal Gear Solid, but there was plenty to occupy my attention (and I was pleasantly surprised to see Aiden's family have a more important role in the story instead of just appearing for a couple of missions before being written out). Aiden himself was a more interesting character than other reviewers gave him credit for; yes, he's a bit of a stiff, but given his past experiences, that's understandable. Aiden is a realistically flawed character: he's intelligent and very calm under pressure, yet stubborn. He's also cold and calculating, yet believes in justice and does what he can to help the innocent. Again, he's no Solid Snake, but Aiden Pearce is a character I'd like to see more of in a future installment (which is apparently being planned). The supporting characters were also pretty interesting, though I personally wanted to see a lot more of Jordi Chin, Aiden's hired gun (a.k.a.: fixer) who offers much needed assistance for the right price. Jordi's laid back attitude and dark sense of humor mixed well with Aiden's more serious disposition, but unfortunately Jordi got much less screen time than any of the other supporting characters.

As Aiden explores the expansive city of Chicago, he'll exploit the advanced surveillance system known as ctOS to accomplish his goals. In both the main and side-missions, Aiden will be able to infiltrate enemy territory to steal information or get to a specific individual who may have something he needs. Many times you will have the option to infiltrate enemy strongholds through stealth, go in guns blazing, or a satisfying combination of both, although certain missions will require a stealth approach. This was fine by me since the stealth approach in this game was usually the more entertaining option. Aiden can cause all sorts of havoc for his enemies without even having to physically go into their strongholds. By using his super smartphone known as the Profiler, Aiden can take control of any nearby cameras to get a lay of the land and mark his enemies, as well as activate other electronics and machinery to distract or take out enemy sentries. He can overload electrical grids and make them explode into his enemies' faces, he can activate grenades while they're still in the pockets of the enemies carrying them, he can activate fork lifts to get an enemy's attention, and he can even cause cranes to drop containers on top of any unfortunate shmucks who may have wandered underneath them (splat!).

When the shooting starts, Aiden will have to turn to his collection of handguns, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, grenades, and bombs that he will acquire along his journey either by looting them from defeated enemies, or buying them from gun stores or buying parts for crafting from pawn shops. A bullet-time mechanic that runs on a focus meter slows the gameplay down for a moment to allow Aiden to shoot enemies with pinpoint precision. And for up close and personal encounters, Aiden can use his telescopic baton to lay the smackdown on enemies either directly or through stealth. Weapons and other ctOS exploits like jamming communications, causing blackouts, and scanning for nearby enemies to appear on the mini-map can be accessed through a weapon-wheel which is very much like the one in Red Dead Redemption. You have to go through the inventory in real time, which can make things rather intense while you're in the middle of a gunfight. All these weapons, hacks, and other abilities can be upgraded with experience points earned by defeating enemies and completing missions. Puzzles play a relatively small role in this game and pretty much always involve Aiden hacking into secure systems by manipulating access points; basically you're moving several spinning nodes around into just the right positions so that a data stream can reach its intended point. It's actually less complicated than it sounds, but in any case these hacking puzzles were well done and had just the right combination of accessibility and challenge.

Fortunately, the more standard hacking of cameras and other environmental features is done with the simple push of a button. When driving around the city, Aiden can manipulate street lights, pop-up road barriers, raise or lower bridges, and even burst steam pipes underneath the streets to cause geyser-like eruptions that are all capable of disabling pursuing vehicles. This is especially useful on cops who will not stop chasing Aiden until he slows them down enough so he can get out of sight and hide somewhere until the search is called off. There were times though where the cops would just keep coming and not let up the chase, which proved annoying. These chases were also further complicated due to the driving controls. This is one aspect of the game that other reviewers were not exaggerating about. The driving controls were definitely rather iffy. Some cars controlled fine, but many other vehicles operated like slick poop, especially with regards to turning. Some vehicles turned sharply with just a slight twitch of the left analog stick, while others refused to turn even if you pushed the left stick all the way to the left or right. It took me a while to get used to the general movement controls for Aiden, but eventually controlling him became second nature. The driving on the other hand normally proved to be quirky at best and problematic at worst. One other minor annoyance with the driving involves pedestrians. Almost every time I drove near a pedestrian, even if I was going barely 1 mile per hour into a parking space, any pedestrians who happened to be walking nearby would jump away and freak out as if I had been drag racing against Vin Diesel in a Fast and Furious movie. Oh, and you can't shoot while driving, which kind of sucks because enemies can shoot you while they're driving.

When you want to take a break from the main campaign, there are plenty of collectibles to find and side-missions to take part in. The most common side-missions are the crimes in progress, where Aiden will get a notification on his Profiler of someone preparing to commit a crime, and when Aiden arrives at the designated location, he must find a vantage point and watch the perpetrator or victim (if applicable) and put a stop to whatever crime is about to be committed. These normally involve muggings, assassinations, stalking incidents, and the setting of bombs. There are also some occasional random crimes that pop up without warning that can be dealt with, and like the crimes in progress, these can lead to entertaining foot chases. Sidenote: one strange issue I noticed with the foot chases was that a couple of times the perpetrators would somehow climb and jump over 20 foot walls to get away from me; a strange glitch which should be dealt with in any future sequels. Other side-missions involve attacking criminal convoys and either incapacitating or killing specific targets, which can prove challenging if the targets are surrounded by a large number of armed bodyguards, and there are also gang hideouts to infiltrate so Aiden can show them who's in charge by knocking out their leaders.

Fixer contracts, which provide some extra cash, will have Aiden get into a vehicle to act as a decoy to get the cops' attention, chase down other hackers to steal information from them, and drive stolen vehicles to designated drop points before time runs out while trying to avoid taking too much damage. As previously mentioned, there are a large number of collectibles to find all over the city. First, in order to bring up the locations of all these collectibles, Aiden must infiltrate certain ctOS control centers to gain access to a district's infrastructure and be able to profile citizens (and enemies), then he must hack into nearby ctOS control towers to make the district's collectibles show up on the map; the locations of different hideouts where Aiden can sleep, change outfits, and save his progress also pop up after hacking into the ctOS towers. Most of the collectibles are audio logs that provide extra background info on certain characters and additional story elements. Many of these audio logs accompany clues that have to be collected in order to solve certain investigations like locating hidden weapons caches, stopping a human trafficking ring, or hunting down a serial killer. The privacy invasions are ""special"" collectibles where Aiden can hack into a building's network and watch peoples' private lives unfold through their webcams. These didn't seem to have any point to them other than entertainment value: you could watch a single mother slowly give in to rage as her kids run around screaming like maniacs, watch a guy talk to his girlfriend (a female mannequin) about the possibility of marriage, or watch another guy pressure a hooker to play a deadly game of Russian roulette.

There are even mini-games to take part in for those who are interested like shell games, poker, chess, or 3D virtual reality games where you shoot aliens or run through the city collecting coins. The Digital Trips are the most entertaining mini-games, where Aiden will put in an earpiece that sends images to his brain and lets him experience special games as if he were a part of them. These include him playing games where he jumps on giant flowers that pop up all over the city, runs over flame-headed demons in a post-apocalyptic supercar, and sneaks past an army of robots with security cameras for heads. My favorite Digital Trip by far was Spider-Tank, where you take control of a large robotic spider and destroy everything around you while jumping, stomping, and shooting your way through the city. I would love it if Ubisoft would go into their by now inexhaustible ""Assassin's Creed fund"" and put just a fraction of that money towards a stand-alone game or even DLC for Spider-Tank, with an expanded map and more enemies to destroy (and possibly a decent story). This is highly unlikely, but a gamer can dream, can't he? Another feature I'd like to discuss in Watch Dogs is its reputation system. It's actually rather simple; doing things like killing cops and civilians lowers Aiden's reputation, whereas killing only criminals (or better yet, incapacitating them) and helping civilians raises his reputation. A higher reputation makes it less likely for citizens to call the cops on you if you get involved with shootouts and increases the number of positive news reports of Aiden's activities on the radio. This doesn't affect the game's story, but instead affects actual gameplay.

Hacking the phones of citizens to take money from their bank accounts does not affect Aiden's reputation (no one knows you're doing it, afterall), yet I found myself selectively taking money from those who could spare it and staying out of the accounts of citizens who appeared to need it, like the guy undergoing chemotherapy or the waitress saving up money for college. With the Profiler active, every citizen's and criminal's personal info including age, occupation, income, hobbies, or list of crimes (if applicable) can be viewed at your leisure, and the sheer scope of different backgrounds for all the citizens is truly staggering and brings further life into the already lively citizens of Chicago. This option to see citizens' background info once had me actually regretting saving a woman from an attempted mugging after seeing that she had previously been involved in two counts of second degree murder. The last feature for Watch Dogs has to do with its online component. While playing the main game, you can be randomly invaded by other players who will try to hack your phone and then leave with your information, or you can invade other gamers and return the favor. You can also take part in online driving missions and tailing missions where you chase another player and try to download his info. Honestly, I tried the online stuff a couple of times, but I quickly lost interest. The singleplayer campaign kept my undivided attention.

The story-based DLC, Bad Blood, has you take on the role of supporting character and Aiden's eventual ally, Raymond Kenney, a.k.a.: T-Bone Grady. His adventure begins a year after the events of the main game with him infiltrating a ctOS control center and causing trouble for Blume, the shady company responsible for creating the system. After making his escape and making preparations to leave the city, T-Bone is drawn back into trouble when an old friend of his is kidnapped and he takes it upon himself to rescue him, which of course leads to more problems that postpone his travel plans. T-Bone will be dealing with the same kind of hacking and shooting missions as Aiden in the main game, but they're no less challenging or fun. He can make use of the same types of ctOS exploits as Aiden with his own Profiler, as well as the same types of weapons; he can also take down enemies up close with a combination of his 2 ft. wrench and taser. One unique gadget in his arsenal is his custom r/c car named Eugene. Functioning in a similar manner to Solid Snake's Metal Gear Mk. II/III from Guns of the Patriots, T-Bone can guide Eugene into enemy territory to get to normally inaccessible areas and to unlock doors or deactivate security systems. Eugene can also incapacitate enemies with its own built-in taser or even blow itself up with packets of C4 to take out a group of enemies in one fell swoop (don't worry, Eugene can be rebuilt with just a couple of spare parts).

Like in the main game, T-Bone can take part in side-missions called ""street sweeps"", where he forms an unofficial alliance with a Chicago detective and accepts some off the books jobs from her to undermine the efforts of the city's most dangerous criminals, mainly gangsters, fixers, and militiamen. These street sweeps consist of blowing up cargo containers, knocking out or occasionally killing specific targets, or downloading stolen information on the city's police department from laptops. These missions have optional objectives like not being spotted, not using weapons, or making sure not to kill any enemies; completing these objectives earns T-Bone some extra cash, but again, they're optional (and sometimes not worth the effort...or even possible). He can also undertake driving contracts where he takes vehicles tied to previous crimes and drives at high speeds to avoid being tracked, drives cars to drop-off points with minimal damage before time runs out, or escorts VIPs to their destinations. Finally, T-Bone has his own set of collectibles to find linked to investigations regarding a manhunt for Aiden Pearce and an ominous threat being issued to the hacker collective DedSec. For a DLC, Bad Blood has a decent amount of content to keep you busy; the main campaign is actually kind of short, but still fun, and the side content is rather plentiful. It also adds an online co-op component where you can complete street sweep missions with another player.

In conclusion, Watch Dogs was a worthwhile game to play. It isn't revolutionary, but it's still plenty of fun and the hacking features were very well implemented in a believable manner without appearing like magic or feeling overpowered. There are improvements that could and should be made for the sequel, namely a more involved story with an even stronger focus on character development. Better and smoother driving controls would also be a huge plus. I can see why some gamers were disappointed with the end result of Watch Dogs, however the game did not deserve the overwhelming amount of hate it received when it made its debut (chalk it up to unrealistic expectations and the fact that some gamers simply can't be pleased no matter what). This is a fun game with lots of content and should be recognized as such.",12-01-2014

Also like Grand Theft Auto, it's not all that great of a GAME.  They spent so long making sure the camera angles were badass, they forgot to playtest the damn thing.  Combat is nearly impossible with the control scheme they've decided on, especially when your character sticks to cover like he's cemeted to the wall, no matter what buttons you push.  I've made it 70% through the main story of the game (according to the progress tracker), I've unlocked all the puzzles, finished all the races, stolen all the cars, and have hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank.  I just finished playing the same very easy combat area fifteen damn times because your character cannot run away from grenades.  I've been playing video games for 25 years, and the last time I've been this frustrated with a crappy combat system was when I threw my GTA4 disc across the room and vowed never to play it again.  Watch Dogs is dangerously close to the same fate.  A game cannot be considered ""good"" if it actively prevents you from enjoying its most exciting parts.

Usually I go to Youtube to see if I like a game enough to buy it. But I'm not one to produce a full-on review video, so here is a written, old school review. I wrote it for people who do not have the game but want to know if it's worth buying. I played in on a PS4.

Is it like GTA?
Let's face it: Grand Theft Auto has had such an immense impact on sandbox games that any other game featuring open world gameplay in a modern urban setting will be compared. So, is it like GTA? No. Is it worse or better? No, it's different. While GTA keeps a keen sense of self-effacing humor with pedestrians on silly phone calls and adolescent boy humor on billboards etc, the environment in Watch Dogs is much more serious. No silly commercials or crazy talk show hosts. In this Chicago, you're surrounded by a sinister society full of sociopaths, shut-ins, perverts, and other questionable charcters. And that's just the freeroam portion. Wait until you start campaign, you're really going to get to see sick s***. but I'm getting ahead of myself...

How's the freeroam?
I love sandbox games. I almost exclusively play games that are open world, because I love to role play as much as possible, and enjoy the freedom of chosing my own pacing. The second I exit the instructinoal sequence, I'm off, running aimlessly around looking at architecture and scenery, ogling at textures and running like an ant on hot summer pavement...

What's it look like?
Watch Dogs got bad press upon release because of a number ofthings that simply do not live up to the hype. On PS4, which is my system, the graphics simply aren't perceptibly better than the latest stuff you get on a 10-year old PS3. I know not to belive a release trialer of course, even if they say ""actual gameplay"". But still, It's a huge let-down for New-gen console owning graphics whores like me, but I can get over it, if the gameplay is fun (sure, PC... but I'm not buying a $600.- GPU anytime soon, so... please leave the comments about PC superiority to another thread, I beg you). I'm going to rip Watch Dogs to shreds for a moment, but hear me out... in the end, the game redeems itself. I blame it on the release timing: no AAA game right now can afford to not release on Old-gen consoles, and as a result, this game suffers from neither-here-nor-there syndrome. On New-gen, the graphics aren't taking full advantage of the hardware, and on Old-gen, it's stretching the system so much that people report stuttering that is occasionally bad enough to get in the way of gameplay. It's too bad, really, because on a New-gen system, there are notable things that really make this world stand out: details. And I'm not just talking about high-res textures.

How's the ambient environment?
The Chigago you inhabit in this game is more realistic than I expected. This is not imediately apparent but once you start exploring nooks and crannies, and also walk around the back alleys and industrial sectors, you will notice the amount of detail that has gone into the world. Thanks to the 8GB of RAM on New-gen consoles, the number of NPC's, the amount of clutter, the high-res textures and procedural animations, weather systems, rain drops and dynamic bullet holes on wind shields, the variety of cars spawning around you, the light rays between tree leaves, it all really adds up to a feeling of being in a place that is alive. It's funny, because you immeditely get used to it and start expecting more. I found myself wanting to talk to any NPC, Skyrim-style: hey how's it going, got a light?, attempting to pick up clutter because I thought I could use it for crafting, and often got frustrated that a high-res window texture that looks like real glass can't be shattered with a blow from my sawed-off shotgun. Because, you know, destroying stuff is fun! On that note, I recommend the completely overhyped activity of hacking a traffic light and causing a crash. Pro tip: choose a high traffic intersection and wait for a bit, maybe toss a grenade.... rarely do you see such magnificent explosions in any game. Ubisoft, thank you for making destruction truly awesome-loking and sounding. After the mayhem dies down and the fire engine and ambulance leave, engage in a little bit of car collecting: park them all on top of each other in a huge pile, and drop a couple grenades. I promise you, you will be pleased with the result, even if you're a veteran of the Los Santos Pyrotechnics crew.

What's it sound like?
Another thing that really stands out in Watch Dogs is the soundtrack. Modern beats that sound like a real movie score give campaign chases and invasions a truly cinematic feel. Same goes for the radio in vehicles. When it comes to radio programming, Watch Dogs eats GTA's lunch. The music collection is far more modern and varied. Unfortunately, the total number of songs - even including those you can unlock by hacking NPC's cellphones for their music collection - is not as high as in GTA, so you're bound to get bored soon, but especially in the beginning hours of your freeroam playthrough, keep skipping stations because you're bound to find something you like. A music app on your phone supposedly lets you edit the play list, but for some reason it wouldn't work for me. Ambient sounds are a bit generic, as I've noticed more audible ambient details (such as sparrows chirping in trees) even in shooters like Battlefield 3. Worst of all: the civilian car horns all sound the same. I'm into role-playing freeroam games, and I like to enter the car, switch to interior viewpoint to make it look more realistic, and honk at stupid idiot NPC cars that - get outta my way, bitch! - drive 4 mph. Of course they don't react, so I just careen into them... duh! Car engine sounds, especially sports cars, sound terrible. The exception are muslce cars, but even those are a bit one-dimensional. It's this kind of detsail that requires a multi-year commitment across several releases to get it all sorted out, so it's not really a complaint, more a realization: the meat that is in the game is actually so good that I start noticing the little stuff, and I'm happy to have a game that is good enough to get me annoyed at the lack of car horn variety.

How's it play?

Driving
The very first thing you will notice is the absolutely horrific turning radius at higher speeds, and the overzealous acceleration from low to high speed. Most cars are RWD and immediately spin out as soon as you tap the gas. It sucks. Big time. The driving is one mechanic that truly kills the early enjoyment of this game and almost caused me to put the game on Ebay after playing it for a couple of hours while I did nothing but destroyed every lamp post, fence, ran over 1,043 pedestrians and totaled 624 cars - all without even trying to. After a while, I noticed that motorcycles are actually pretty well balanced, and the road bike that looks like a Harley Davidson is now my favorite vehicle in the game. You can get used to the driving physics, but even after roughly 40 hours of game time, I'm still not really liking it, it's more a means to an end, since fast travel options are limited. If Ubisoft issues another iteration of this franchise - and I am certain they will - I do hope they will spend a lot of their efforts on improving this one aspect. The saving grace are the totally unrealistic but very forgiving impact physics. Drive into a bolted-down mailbox at literally 2 mph, and watch it essentially explode. Same for plowing your dinky little Kia lookalike into a fire truck on the freeway (in oncoming traffic, of course, I mean, like, who drives on the freeway in the same direction as everyone else, right?)... you will barely have a scratch from that one.

Hacking
It's much less annoying than the puzzles in Assassins Creed. The puzzles are all of the same type: figure out how to complete a circuit. It befits the story line and it's not too hard to get the hang of it. Cam-surfing, as I like to call it, will soon become second nature as you case a joint to plan an invasion/infiltration. Ubisoft clearly repurposed it's engine from Assassins Creed and Far Cry. If you liked how those games play as far as strongholds go, you will be right at home in Chicago. Hacking Towers unlocks map icons, and once you know how many goons are patrolling the place you won't have to worry about random new spawn shotgunning you from 4 feet behind. Boss fight = grenade, just like in Far Cry. No surprises there.

Shooting
A new thing I liked and had a hard time getting accustomed to: light materials like windows or fences allow you to hurt enemies if you shoot through it. I'm still used to thinking: oh, there is geometry in the way, I can't snipe your ass now, bumer. Not so! This in fact opens up some interesting stealth murder opportunities, if you're into that sort of thing. Overall, guns are not upgradeable, but you unlock them as you pick them up or buy them, and yu'll quickly find yourself having more guns than you know what to do with. I found that dumb. The point of a sniper rifle is to be hard to pinpoint, but even the low-caliber rifles don't have silencers. You shoot an enemy from 4 blocks away and they still all start their chicken dance. Generally, the various guns do have some differences, so it does help to switch to the right gun for the job. Enemies are as dumb as they ever were in Assasins Creed and Far Cry games: scripted paths and zero intelligence - I was quite disappointed that Ubisoft did not work on a more refined version of their stronghold defense gameplay mechanics. It convinced me that initially, this was probably an Assassins Creed game (plenty of threads on this theory, and a handful of easter eggs, too), but then got developed into its own franchise. But beware of enemies you hunt down with a vehicle, as that variety has the nasty habit to pop out of the car before it crashes, leaving you to have to wait through your car exiting animation while they start turning you into a sieve with bullets. Not fun at all. I hope Ubisoft will provide a fix for this bug. My solution is to make sure my car is positioned favorably before I exit.

Strategy
The architectue around strongholds and some mission objectives is so varied and detailed that it's not always apparent how to get to the right place. One area called the Bunker does require you to think outside the box, and I was really satisfied once I finally figured it out, after casing the joint for a good 20 minutes realtime (cue comment section for people stating how easy they found that one). I suppose the game has to appeal to players with less patience or curiosity than me, but I wish they had made a lot more of these scenarios that are just not so straightforward. Most of the time it's really easy and hacking that area will take you 1 minute tops. A few missions have cavernous interiors with lots of enemies and require a stealth approach. That's when you have to remember your training from playing Hitman. Because you're not in an exterior bouncing about on rooftops like some templar assassin, these missions become a little more challenging, in my opinion. But rest assured, there are plenty of scenarios that allow you to choose the Rambo strategy. With crafting skills and its resulting toolkit at full disposal, you will be able to put any Dolph Lundgren/Bruce Willis action scene to shame. If only those enemies would stop simply ferreting back and forth between 2 scripted spots, it could be challenging. But I'm not complaining - I'm a hero, gunning down 24 guys in the time it takes to post something on Twitter. Finally, a really fun part is a new twist to the cam-surfing mechanic. I won't spoil it for you by getting into detail, but trying to find a path though enemy territory without actually being there does present some unique challenges that I haven't yet had to deal with in a game before.",10-30-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Toeing the Line,"Watch Dogs isn't a perfect game that can at times become frustrating and repetitive, but it tells an entertaining story with a believable antihero at the helm that, like everything else in the game, finds a balance between hero and villain. The antihero the game revolves around, Aiden Pearce, is a hired gun of sorts out to save the world through violence and destruction. Anyone who has seen Boondock Saints will have a loose grasp on the general story and the protagonist. If you don't like the premise of saving the world through morally reprehensible means, you probably won't find the story appealing.

The game both looks and sounds good. The graphics are technically strong, bringing to life a beautiful knock off of Chicago in the fall. The world itself looks nice, the character models are well done and the models for the main characters come close to looking realistic. The main cast does an excellent job of voicing their characters, while the sound effects are full bodied and add to the game. The one area the presentation falters is in the physics. The NPC characters that fill the city just don't look right when they run and cars, especially motorcycles, bounce off things in ways that arejarring and remind you that this isn't reality, which we all know it isn't, but it still makes you think about it when you're supposed to be enjoying the game. While graphics, voice acting and sound effects aren't everything, they can really help make the experience more enjoyable and they do just that in Watch Dogs.

The gameplay is a fun knock off of GTA with hacking added in. There is the standard stealing cars, evading the police, killing rivals and general destruction and mayhem. On top of that is added interactions that can be used to help evade police by turning traffic signals to cause accidents or raising bridges, along with helping in combat. There are numerous minigames within the game that are varied and fun. They range from hacking based minigames where you try to hack into a webcam or phone to invade someone's privacy (within the game it's less creepy than it sounds, but still makes you feel weird), to combat missions to driving based contracts. Gun combat is fun and there is a variety of weapons to choose from so you can find what fits your playstyle. After a certain point I only ended up using two guns for the rest of the game (a silenced Vector ACP and a .50 caliber sniper rifle called ""The Destroyer"") but it felt more like I had found the guns that fit my playstyle than these were the guns to use and everything else was terrible. The game can become unpleasant to play at times. Police chases can drag on for far too long and there are spikes in difficulty in some of the combat based mingames. For trophy hunters there are two trophies in particular that are terrible. Traced, which is completely out of your control, and Disc Space Full, which will most likely require you going insane trying to find the Ms. Crumby song. When trophies/achievements are so luck based and so frustrating to get it takes the joy out of working to get them.

The story and characters are where the game truly shines. The protagonist strikes an excellent balance between ""he's a terrible person"" and being able to root for him to succeed. He does a lot of good through a lot of terrible means. The story is aware of this and delves into it. The side characters and antagonists are colorful characters that range from entertaining to interesting. There are numerous side stories within the game through investigations that are interesting and make you feel more like you're expanding on a rich world than having to run around looking for collectibles.

The online is fun, and honestly funny, though it's not something you'll probably come back to after a while. There are online races, two spying based modes and what essentially comes down to online team keepaway . The two spying based games are by far the best of the group and can be really funny watching how people react trying to find you. I laughed several times at people seeing what they did trying to find me, realizing I did the same thing when being invaded and how I must look.

Watch Dogs walks a fine line very well. There are times you feel creepy hacking into someone's webcam to watch them, and times you feel like a hero tracking down a serial killer. There are times the protagonist feels morally reprehensible, but at the same time is doing what he does to try to make the world better. The cast of side characters are mostly terrible people, but you can see their humanity and understand them as the story goes on. Watch Dogs is no brainer for anyone who likes a dark story, sandbox gameplay and an antihero lead, but also has a good enough story and combat that I would recommend it to anyone who likes GTA type games.

Given the amount of content in the game and a multiplayer that is fun I would recommend Watch Dogs as a buy.",10-25-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Watch Dogs Updated Review,"I played Watch Dogs not long after release, and picked up the Season Pass as well.  After playing both of these things all the way through and doing much of what has been offered, I can give you a better, more thorough review of what this game has to offer.

Please note, this is a review for the PS4, so of course, experiences will differ, whether you are playing on last-gen consoles, current-gen, or PC.  We all know about the graphics debacle for the PC, and the ""fix"" that took place after some time to help correct this.

Graphics
-------------
For me, playing this on the PS4 was an amazing experience.  I am not a graphics fanboy by any stretch of the imagination, but the level of detail in this game impressed me.  From the day/night effects to the sunsets, rain......all of it looks very well detailed.  Considering this is a console instead of a PC, I was very impressed.  Not much framerate issues, aside from the occasional time when there is a TON of stuff happening on the screen, or in some online multiplayer experiences (but those may be due to connection issues as well, depending on your hookup).

Control
----------
For the stealth sections and overall maneuvering around feels very well controlled, but the driving sometimes leaves something to be desired.  Would it be cool to have drifting mechanics in here?  Quite possibly, but it's not really heartbreakingly bad.  You do have good enough control to get where you are going on the whole, and I had little problems making it from any point A to point B.  The way the menus are set up to select your weapons feels very natural as well, and you can switch out your entire arsenal on the fly, along with crafting your hacking tools, so you won't have to spend much thought process on how you're going to switch out to what you want to use.

Gameplay
---------------
To me, this is a game more about stealth than weapon selection, although you do use weapons a lot.  There are some areas you can actually get all the way through without a single person seeing you were even there!  In fact, one of the ctOS regional stations, you can actually surf the cameras all the way to the hacking point, and get into the system without setting one foot inside of the restricted area at all!  The side missions give you plenty to do in order to keep you busy, from Fixer Contracts, to Criminal Convoys, to QR Code finds, there is something that will interest just about any gamer out there.

To me, this is a game that gives a pretty wide variety of play styles all within the same game, so you're doing a little bit of this and a little bit of that, instead of eating the same course all the way through the meal.  I highly recommend getting the Season Pass, as it gives you a TON of additional content, including the Bad Blood DLC.  After all........surfing cameras is cool, but surfing cameras with guns on them is even cooler!",10-23-2014

Hacking doesn't feel integral.  Hacking feels like a gimmick, a hook to just sell the game.  I was really into having a unique game pay experience.  It did feel that way for a couple hours.  But the hacking got old fast and began to feel like a gimmick.  I had a lot of hopes for Watch Dogs.  Maybe too many.  Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for GTA.  Maybe if I'd known the similarities, known what I was getting into.  None of the reviews I read accused Watch Dogs of being a GTA knockoff.

The story was terrible.  I couldn't get into it at all.  I quit the story after the second act and just unlocked a ton of stuff and did a ton of side quests till I got too bored, till it became repetitious.

I don't pay attention to that it takes place in Chicago even though I am from here. But it was nice to visit our BEAN statue ( even though it's upside down ).

  Gameplay is smooth and graphics are much better than on PS3 even on my old Vizio 120 Hz TV. The rain drops on the ground, the reflection of the street lights in puddles of rain water and the quality of Lake Michigan just blow me away.

  Many people complain about the car handling I kind of agree but not entirely. I think is actually more realistic when you compare it to GTA 5 driving. But Ubisoft blew it when it comes to car damage. It's horrible.

The only downside is that to some degree there is a feeling of emptiness in the game because you feel like they should have developed it and fleshed it out some more with more features and content, but it's not enough to make the game not worth playing.

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,An odd combination of satisfying and frustrating,"I saw the initial reveal of this game at E3 a few years ago and, like most people, I was immediately interested and waited for its release. There's plenty of information on the Internet that goes over what happened during those 2 years between reveal and release, but overall this game does not deliver the impressions that it gave back then.

I had this game pre-ordered for PS4 as a launch title. Then it was delayed and I cancelled my order; deciding instead to wait for impressions from professional reviewers and fellow gamers. Initial impressions were that it was very average and I will largely agree with that. I did not buy this game at launch and instead decided I'd wait until it went on sale or I could get a used copy. Eventually Amazon offered it for 40% off so I picked it up thinking that it had to be worth at least 30-something bucks. I finished the game and now have it up on eBay hoping to recoup some of that money. It was barely worth the money I paid.

The first thing that struck me wrong about this game is the control scheme. It just feels... off. It's a ""typical"" 3rd person shooter so I was expecting a ""default"" control scheme but it wasn't what I got. It took me probably close to 3 hours to really become familiar with the controls. By the end of the game I had it figured out really well, but that's not a good thing. By extension, I never felt like the game controlled well even when I had the control system figured out well. Cars handle pretty poorly for a game that has such a strong emphasis on driving. Sure, they are all supposed to feel unique but I felt like a lot of them were excessively ""loose"" while everything else was incredibly ""tight"". Only the motorcycles really felt like fun to drive. Aiden controls pretty well, for the most part though. There were a few issues I had getting him to un-stick from cover or getting him to climb up or over an object.

The gameplay in the game is chiefly divided into 3 separate categories: hacking, combat and driving. The hacking is fun and often very satisfying when it works perfectly. There's little mini-game puzzles that sometimes get thrown at you while performing hacks. They're not usually too hard but sometimes have time limits imposed on them. They're somewhat similar to the Bioshock water pipe puzzles. In combat situations the hacking can be a huge benefit to give you the upper hand. And that's when the game absolutely feels the best. I loved more than anything else the stealthy sections of the game. I loved hiding and picking enemies off one-by-one with my night-stick, overloading a nearby transformer, detonating the enemy's own grenades or simply shooting them in their stupid face with a silenced pistol. The silenced 1911 is my favorite weapon in the whole game. If this whole game was just a sneaky-hacky game I'd love it way more, but (in my opinion) everything else just isn't as good. The other weapons are rather standard (and as far as I know all real-life weapons) such as pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles and grenade launchers. The assault rifles and shotguns feel powerful and were my other go-to weapons when things got gritty. Overall I think combat is good and balanced. The driving sections of the game I felt were personally the worst parts of the game. Any time I had to chase down a subject in a car I just groaned. I usually had to do these sections lots of times because the cars handle so poorly I'd lose the target or crash my car into something ridiculous and take forever to get sorted out. Also, when chasing down target cars there are only a couple ways to incapacitate the cars and one of them involves ""purchasing"" the skill from the unnecessary upgrade path. The vehicles and chase sequences are easily my least liked portions of the game and they were relatively frequent.

I found the story rather unexciting and uninspired. The characters were alright if not completely stereotyped. I found myself enjoying one of the supporting characters (Jordi) more than any of the others. He was well acted and had some real personality to him. Everybody else felt... bland. Aiden, even though he is supposedly fueled by vengeance, just comes off as being a gravely voiced butthurt toughguy. He's shallow and shows no character progression throughout the entire game. By the end of the game he talks about some remorse he has for his actions but never has any kind of revelations. His emotional range is either whiney baby or rage-fueled anger. It's like an on/off switch. You eventually meet a few characters that will help you seek revenge and even they feel one-note. Only Clara feels like she is a little more human than the rest. Clara, by the way seems to be largely influenced in appearance by Lisbeth from Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It's almost as if they couldn't create a hacker-type girl without seeking out a pop-culture reference to copy. The same goes for a DJ you meet later in the game that is a blatant copy of deadmau5 (I will forever pronounce it dead-mow-five).

When this game was close to release all the talk on the Internet was about the ""graphics downgrade"" that it had been given over the years. Regardless of the truth about this it isn't very impressive graphically. Sure, it's better than the last-gen consoles could muster but it really doesn't feel like it pushes the new hardware very hard, especially when compared to other open-world games like inFamous: Secon Son (which looks incredible). The lighting is nice and is very dynamic and the weather effects look good. Particle effects and things like explosions look very good, though. The sound design is awesome, though! I played with a 5.1 surround system and it definitely utilizes it well. Explosions shook my sub and certain sections of the game had theme-appropriate music that sounded great. Gunfire and enemy voices echo well in the surround and passing cars at high speed gives a very nice front-to-rear whooshing effect. The sound design is personally better than the visual graphics. I won't say the graphics are bad, they're just not what we were expecting based on what we saw at E3 at the reveal.

Overall, I think this game is decent. It's not good and it's not garbage. It's worth a play if you're interested, but don't expect too much out of it. I think I got decent fun out of it and whatever I make back from selling it will make up for all my frustrating moments. I think this game is like the new Assassin's Creed. The first AC game wasn't very good, but the sequels (more or less) got better each time. I think if we see a Watch_Dogs 2 it can improve greatly on what we see with this game. It's a very ambitious idea and one that has a lot of potential, it just isn't well realized with this game.",09-07-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,The 25 Dollar Ho-Hum Rinse and Repeat Experience,"I believe this to be a far assessment of the game and to be up front there are some spoilers in this review so if you haven't played it yet then you have been warned although even if they are spoilers, I assure you it doesn't take away from the actual experience.

Watch Dogs by Ubi Soft is indeed one of those quasi-open world games in which the illusion of an open world is given to you but really it isn't because its soaked in random mini-games and other side-content of which is there to make you  use the most out of the hacking and shooting aspects within the game.

The problem isn't exactly the shooting, nor the questionable vehicle controls  (  They are getting trashed in the critics section but in reality,  its not so bad and although some missions will leave you frustrated, its a far better mechanic than most in such games) , or the hacking aspect.... its the terrible story writing and plot choices which leaves the gamer completely aside from the events happening to the main character and how the stages and common sense applied to his actions are pretty razor thin if not in-cohesive within Watch Dog's Chicago.

**************************************************************  HERE IS A SPOILER*******************************************************************

Case in point --- you would have to force yourself to believe that Aiden Pierce will go through the hell he's going through for his own sister and nephew which is fine... but when you account for the fact that his face and appearance gets blasted on Chicago News and its obvious their child shrink is most likely a consumer of such media, would in fact put two and two together without Aiden's  "" arch nemesis""  dropping dimes to his wherabouts when their little agreement goes sower.  You call their Nephews psychologists and she's still going with the flow even though she hears obviously thin-paper reasoning as to why his sister doesn't call.

The fact of the matter is, its a questionable plot line to take ---  for the "" hero""  of the said story to kill mobsters,  gangs, and get in the way of Chicago corruption over a bad auto accident from which his niece was slain --- which inadvertently happened due to a hit.  It would have been a lot more appropriate and motivating from the gamer's view that Aiden's direct link to his reasoning for vigilantism is the classic case of some bad event in which his own child or wife was killed.  I imagine many were shrugging their shoulders at some point, slogging through this game and lost a lot of the motivation and dramatic impact because its easy to loose that vital interest for continuous immersion.

********************************************************************  End of Spoiler *************************************************************************

For more enthusiasts that could care less of the story's content, the game play and immersion itself is also repetitive with obvious art-deco tastes of UBI Soft in relation to how the Assassins Creed games are made with slow filling event buttons,  mini-mission insignias,  generic shops, and other UBI trade marks.

The graphics weren't anything to write home about to push the  PS4, the music had more modern selections for it which is probably why many didn't really put an attachment to the sound track.  The buzzing Inception-esque deep bass when something very extreme is going on is also something overdone as well as slow motion stop events  ( when you can time it right to watch them)  when operating some safety barricade during a high speed chase had its cool moments until the more you did them, the more they became dull and un-inspiring.

This being said the  3 stars is given to this game because of its attempt at something different because the hacking aspect of the game does save it from being classified as a complete  GTA rip off.  The all mighty smart phone was a pretty good exchange for the non-shooting from the car window that was sorely missed, especially during tedious car missions.  You can spy on people, hack people's accounts, find interesting blurbs of social life, and even hack into people's apartments.  The game also brings us a very deep question involving what the animus of the game is about ---  PRIVACY VIOLATION and Government snooping, something that has grabbed our own headlines recently in the news.  This is indeed the world of which we are making ourselves in which every camera in every corner, provided with a snoopy cloud sever can collect meta-data on all of us for some unseen purpose.  They do promote this well in the game even though, even with the hacking, you are forced to find things that are a waste of code and the developer's time because the teen-age humor and sexual blurbs may make a chuckle or two but in the grand scheme of things,  mostly not needed and obvious fan service in many cases.

I would say its not worth  more than  25.00 of your time.  It has its moments and it kind of picks the pace up where it needs to but the plot is terrible and uninspiring.  I think most people wanted to play this game because of the big  PR campaign and the fact that the PS4 is still young and lacks a diversity in content.  You can't really say much for the thin library so I think part of the drive is the hunger for a game that will last you awhile for the new kick comes around.... and that is what this game feels like, something kind of put together to lightly entertain you hopefully before you get tired of the weak missions and generic level design.

Gamers, get this one on sale and play it but don't get your hopes too high. I would use this as filler until the other titles come out later in the year but this wasn't the big bang that it claimed to be.",09-07-2014

If you liked grand theft auto (v or otherwise) then play that game for the driving and shooting stuff. The controls in Watch Dogs were uncomfortable, even after allowing a week of daily play to adjust to them. The driving was horrendous, and, I'll admit, I'm a terrible video game driver, but I much preferred the mechanics in GTAV and I didn't like those either. The ""snap to cover"" concept was poorly executed as well. One last thing and I'll stop complaining: the Pice de rsistance was supposed to be the hacking capabilities that the main character had. This, too, fell short for me and left me thinking that this hacking idea was more of a gimmick than an actual pivotal part of the game.
Okay, so I lied. The final thing in my diatribe, is the story. Never in all of gaming's history have I been so uninspired to play the story out. The characters were all cookie cutters from other stories and were too cliched and without any real depth. This is a REVENGE story, end of point. Nothing to see here; these are not the droids you are looking for. Move along. Move along.

Now I must say, the graphics were pretty impressive considering this was a game that was ported to previous gen systems like the ps3 and xbox360 as well as the ps4 and xbox one. The graphical prowess could've been more impressive, but it was very good from an ""old gen perspective"" which is all I really expected. However, the water's physics were very impressive, though it looked more like runny jello that Aiden was swimming in rather than actual water. I can't say too much else positive about this game...",09-06-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,Good game or a great one - depends on how you play it,"Watch Dogs, graphically, looks great. The city is full of life and the streets don't feel empty. Lots of cars and lots of people with various personal details that you can see or hack for cash, information, songs, access codes and system keys. Though I did see some popups which you don't want in a next generation console, graphically it is still remarkable. After several hours some stuff gets repeated, especially hacked voice conversations.

When I initially started watch dogs, I was underwhelmed with all aspects of game play. The driving was a chore and taking down enemy vehicles were a nightmare. Action was not fluent and unlike GTA you were limited how you do and approach things. Hacking was fun but did not seem very effective at creating explosions to take down enemies. Hacking traffic lights to stop enemy vehicles were mostly useless - especially at night with lesser vehicles around. Avoiding the police or enemies in cars was near impossible. That is till I got it right.

After a particularly frustrating mission that I could not complete, I took to the internet forums. It was then that I came to know what it was I was doing wrong. Most of the missions in Watch Dogs can be done using stealth and hacking. Some skill upgrades are vital, so that the game is no longer frustrating. Taking down enemy personnel and enemy cars become easier - but more on that later.

So, how to get skill upgrades? By doing side missions and not concentrating solely on the main mission. Dealing with criminal activity is the easiest. It gives you skill points and increases your reputation - which means people will be less likely to call police to report you and less of you having to escape the ctos scan and possible police chase every time you pull a gun in public. I also find them fun.

However, my most favorite method is to complete gang hideouts where you need to take down (but not kill) a target(s) and which can be done using stealth, sticking to cover, using distractions, taking down (or kill) guards and deciding on the correct approach route.
The first gang hideout I completed, I marked every guard using the cameras, I took down all guards but one (which I killed) and then chased and took down the frightened target. That was the NOT the easy way. That was also not the hardest way. Hardest was when I tried to kill everyone using guns or hacking the environment. Also note that triggering explosions by hacking to kill guards actually makes them more alert and increases possibility of them calling for backup. Since dodging the police is really hard, running around in public with a gun makes it harder, what with having to deal with the police as well. Going all guns blazing can be done, but it is not the most fun. Looking back, if I had taken a better approach route, I could have taken down just the target (with maybe a guard or two - depending on which hideout I am in) without of the guards being the wiser.

Do not look at Youtube videos where you have to kill almost everyone in a mission to take someone down. That is Rambo, not how a hacker should be. Look at the videos where they do it using stealth only. But also note that some of these videos showing stealth are actually speed runs that depend on precise timing and are hard to pull off by a gamer like me. Such precise timing is not really needed. I am a casual gamer and at the very end of the review, I describe how I took down 3 targets (just the targets) in the Beached gang hideout in Pawnee as an illustration of what I mean.

Skills upgrades that are most useful are
1. Steam pipes (very important) - taking down cars become much easier and faster and less dependent on traffic because you can blow up steam pipes almost anywhere on the road and not be dependent on traffic lights and traffic.
2. Disable backup calls - in case stealth does not work and in missions where stealth is not always possible.
2. Enforcer takedown
3. Crafting blackouts
4. Crafting IEDs (not essential but good to have)

Now I fight only when the mission wants me to. When I have to, I use IEDs liberally and stick to cover so that they do not know where I am. There are walkthroughs available with no kills if you are interested. You can use cover to hide if your cover location is not in direct sight of an enemy. You can run from cover to cover. Point to a cover location and press the corresponding button (X for PS4) to get to cover. Even if you do get noticed, it is not a problem if you reach cover before the alert triangle gets complete. Many of the ctos control system hacks can be performed remotely (without confronting guards) using just cameras and hacking to attract guards to certain locations. I also found that waterways are my best friend when I want to get away from persistent enemies. Jump in the water and then swim to a boat to commandeer it.

Pawnee gang hideout beached
My earlier attempts at getting to the targets through the middle failed. I then noticed that all the targets move about around the periphery of the location.
The first target  was standing at the edge of a fence. There was a phone that can be used to attract the target behind the fence. You can jump over and take him down.
The second target patrols a pier. You can go around the edge of the map and take him down once he is at the far end outside the view of the other guards.
The third target patrols closer to the other guards, but his patrol takes him behind a short fence. Go around the edge of the map and jump him when he is behind the fence and out of sight. Even if you get noticed you can run into the water and commandeer the nearby boat.",09-05-2014

Good:
* Hacking mechanics when in bases are actually a really fun twist on the formula.  (Though by the end most of the guards don't fall for the same tricks taking away from some of the fun, cause there aren't a new and different ways to get them to explode.)
* combat mechanics are really good, and feel right.
* people calling the cops on you makes for a fun mini game, kill them before they finish their call.  Which cause someone else to call the police, and try to kill them, winner has the most people calling the police at the same time.
* 'The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo' is in here called Clara, and with a french accent instead of Swedish one.
* Personal Invasion are the only side-missions with something original going on in them.  and some are just down right creepy.  (Must note there is an incredibly annoying beeping sound before each one ends, but nothing happens if you wait it out. so its really just annoying, with no purpose)
* Chicago itself is gorgeous and from a person that lived there for 3 years it really captures a lot of it, though its been completely reorganized and missing large sections of the city.
* There's crafting, it's simple but effective. and the proximity bombs work wonders.  especially on convoy missions.
* Graphics, its a pretty game, not as amazing as the game demo they showed in what was that 2011, but its still really good for what it does.
* always getting new stuff when you complete some challenge or some amount of missions.  it's nice to have an active reward system separate from the trophy system.

The Blah:
* The driving mechanics are like an arcade driver.  everything breaks, shatters, and basically has terrible physics.  Sometimes quite fun to mess with, but does take away from the very serious tone of the game.  i had a fire truck bounce off a little mini
* The main story and especially the end, isn't as bad as people say it is.  the big reveal being a kind of blah reveal was the point, just be ready for it.
* random invaders, i personally did these till i got the trophies and then turned off invasions.  It s neat idea, but you can't start any missions until the person is catch, so when i'm just farting around in chicago its fine, but when i'm trying to do story missions its really annoying.  Also when i played the driving multiplayer game and the combat one, the frame rate would drop down to 10 frames per second it would seem with parts of the levels not even loading up correctly.  not sure if this has been fixed since i stopped playing it.
* Weapons are varied but mostly the same.  And there aren't any rocket launchers to take out annoying helicopters.  you do have a grenade launcher but its accuracy is terrible and better to use on police cars.

The Bad:
* Car chases are boring, expect to be following a person until they find themselves at a random hack scattered around, to cause them to crash.  There are no other combat choices in cars, and sometimes they can take up to 5 - 10 minutes if they get on a road that has no hacks like highways.
* Ton of missions require you to take someone in alive, but are armed with a rifle that kills you in just a few shots.  seems really cheap, should have given Aiden a stun gun or something.
* Music in the car wow it's terrible and worst part there aren't any channels so its like having an iPod stuck of shuffle, changing from metal to country music. you are giving the option to make your own play list, but cause the music is so limited, it seemed even crazier to me to limit myself to even less songs for variety.
* Can't change the volume of the music in the car like in Sleeping Dogs.
* Side missions at the beginning are kind of fun, but after the 20th one you realize they are just one idea over and over again with out any having little story it in there to make myself care.  the little opening saying 'This guys bad, i need to take him down' didn't do it for me.
 * Auto fail mission if you decided to not do it like they think you should.  Really annoying when it doesn't seem to matter at all. plan to fail, and have to replay.  not as bad a AC but has its moments of bad.
* A weird morality system that doesn't seem to do anything, and seems to have a weird choice of whats right and wrong.  I mean by the end of the game you probably kill off every gang member in chicago, and this is considered a nautical or good on the morality meter.
* there is no police presence on the street unless someone calls the police. making random encounters never happen.  they also appear out of nowhere when they are called.
* Boats! the cops and gangsters can't use them, so if your ever needing to escape to complete a mission steal a boat and you're safe.
*when you blow up a car with people hiding behind it, they will often not die, making it seem pointless.
* oh for some reason it makes you listen to the same phones calls from friends to tell you where the next mission is before you can start anything every time you changes areas.  some conversation go on for 5 minutes.  makes doing side missions a real choir by the end with the conversations getting longer and longer.
* No melee combat.  only takedowns that only work on people not aware of you or people that got knocked down.  the guy walks around with a baton, i should be able to just wake things with it.

In Conclusion:
My introduction to Sandbox games was the GTA series, so i kind of expect to be able to just cause chaos, and to do mission how I please.  This game seems to think it isn't a sandbox game but a Assassin Creed Game. Yes, i know people think assassin creed is a sandbox game, and in many ways it looks like one, but the missions, and rules of the game are so confiding and built on some really strange moral code that all the mess around aspect of a good sandbox are lost on those games.  This game is a weird hybrid between GTA but with rainbows and Assassin Creed's linearity.  All that criticism said, i mostly enjoyed my time with this game, highly recommend if you are going for trophies to spend a little time doing everything and not just doing the side missions at the end or you'll be bored to tears.  and always remember for some reason you are the only person that can use boats.  Just bring a high power something to bat those annoying helicopters out of the sky.",08-29-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,2,Clara should have been the main character,"This is really not a great game. I had this game on preorder, they even had the ps4 watch dogs bundle but this game was delayed half a year for absolutely nothing. The graphics are next gen quality...but the gameplay and story lacks luster. The story dragged on and lost interest in the bland and boring main character. Clara is the main gravitational point in this game because she has the most spark and charm out of all the characters. It would do this game much better justice. She's hot, she's interesting, she's alive, and she has personality. Aiden is a MAJOR drag on this story and has a very weak personality. It was a major disappointment to me as to how the game creators disposed of Clara in the middle of the game.

- The story is just plain horrible and cliched. The plot just continues to disappoint on and on as the game progresses and the ending is very very lazy. It also hints at a sequel..which i will not be buying at all.
- Graphics are dumbed down compared to what was in the trailers
- Filler/Baloney dialogue. Enemies blab on an on and never shut up or say anything relevant.
- Hit detection is way off
- Dump the radio music...seriously what is this trash?
- Cannot resell weaponry for cash in the store. You're stuck with guns you'll never use again.
- Police know where you are on the map even when searching for you throughout the city. Wherever you go..they will gravitate toward that area. Unlimited resources. They all shoot like mad dogs whether from helicopters or on foot.
- You're supposed to be a good guy but the game pretty much requires you to hack innocent people's accounts and steal money from them. Also the vigilante bar is useless since you will need to kill many people in the missions.
- Enemy A.I. is stupid as hell. Sometimes they run in circles, sometimes they run in place, they never realize bullets are flying at them. Even when being hit they just stand there for a second.
- Car chases are a complete joke and modeled after every generic game there is - the targets gets in the car and dissapears at light speed..then waits for you a few blocks away until you catch up and he can start driving like michael schumacher on cocaine again.
- When collecting a lot of xp at the end of missions, the game lags.
- Horn sounds (although never really utilized) sound straight out of a ps2 game
- Dumping a car in an alley way and stealing a new one has absolutely no effect on your wanted level. Very frustrating when you're trying to evade police. The only effective ways you can actually evade police is by train and by boat.
- When you're driving at full speed through the city, you'll start seeing cars and objects spawn in front of you (ps2 quality)
- Found a trick to get unlimited xp the first few hours in the game
- Loading times get a bit frustrating after a while
- Free roam in multiplayer is completely useless
- What did he say?? I could hardly hear aiden's voice overs..make sure to turn on subtitles
- The little sound bite it makes when you die gets really annoying
- Secret islands or areas that are hard to get to are not interesting at all. The map is just dead besides the side missions. There's literally nothing to do and to be honest the city is depressing to be in.
- The sight seeing side mission with players being the mayor of the properties was a good idea but used in a wrong way. This should have been a multiplayer battle for control of the property, not about how many times you visit the place. They really had no fun with this game.
- ZERO replay value

Good
- Very human like movements when navigating through the world
- Pedestrian movements and behavior are interesting
- When accident's happen, people get out to inspect their cars and have conversations
- The poker game is a great addition
- Graphics are amazing....BUT not exactly like it was advertised
- Chicago looks like you're looking at the real thing from far away especially from Pawnee
- The soundtrack (not the radio) is great and goes together well with the events happening in the game",08-27-2014

The graphics aren't that good in my opinion (not terrible) but just not that good. If any game ever needed higher res, its this one. The game runs at 900p on the PS4 and you can see alot of aliasing, and the game just doesnt look that sharp, its kinda blurry. Also, the anisotropic filtering is probably set to 2X (anisotropic filtering for those that don't know, makes the textures on the ground and walls look sharper and more detailed rather than blurred, especially as it receeds into the distance). Basically just making the game look rather low res and not very detailed. However, the draw distance is nice, and the size of the world is nice too. I would say the game is just average.

The graphics are meh. The 2012 E3 trailer was clearly out of reach for this game. Sometimes it really does look great, but for the most part there is just nowhere near enough graphicall polish to make this a jaw dropper like the original trailer.

Driving is bad. Like really bad. There is no weight to anything. A telephone pole goes down like tissue paper. Other cars will sometimes explode on impact, while your car is left with a minor scratch. Once you get used to the driving mechanics it makes the game a tad bit more fun, but If you have played GTA you will really appreciate how much time rockstar takes with each detail, especially driving.

The characters voices are pretty much trash. There are worse voice overs in games, but damn this is pretty bland and boring. The dialogue is super cheesy, and there is zero emotion in the characters voices. With that said the soundtrack is very good and I enjoyed it very much. Lots of variety including country, rock, classical and rap.

Story time! Shocker its pretty boring and generic. Aidens niece has been killed and its your job as the uncle to hunt down the killer! Its not awful, but its just not that great either.

So why did i give this game 4 stars?

Well its an absolute blast to play.

Even with all of the terrible things I mentioned above this game is an absolute joy. I love the side missions. I love the guns. I love the explosions. I love the way Aiden moves and ducks for cover.  I love how you can level Aiden and his abilities up throughout the game. I love the random pop ups for online races, deathmatches, and hackers that you need to hunt down. Its all just incredibly enjoyable. But the best thing by far is the hacking.

The fact that every person in the city has a little bio about them is incredible. You can hack peoples bank accounts, cameras, phone calls, spike strips, pipes, and so much more. It makes missions approachable in a ton of different ways. You can go in guns blazing or you can hack the cameras and plan out your route while taking down enemies quietly.

While riding a car you can burst steam pipes making the car you're chasing stop dead in its tracks, or hack a road block and make their car crash, or make an enemy explode by hacking the explosives they are holding, or send a signal jam to block someones call for backup or the police, and the list goes on. Needless  to say the hacking in this game is incredible and by far the best feature.

Watch dogs is not perfect by any means, and there is a lot wrong with a game that took this long to come out and had this much money behind it, but with that said it is just a really fun game that i cannot recommend enough. This is not a game for everyone, and thats understandable, but it does so much that made me love it and play it nonstop. Heres hoping Ubisoft fixes everything that was broken for the sequel and makes the good things even better. Do yourself a favor and give this a shot.",08-06-2014

The world isn't huge but its very big and there is TONS to do, not even counting all the online multiplayer content. Ubisoft makes some of the best games, hands down, and this is no exception!

Basically, think Asscreed meets Splinter Cell. Main character is a bit dull and the narrative suffers from the common Ubi mistake of letting the side characters steal the show, but it is interesting to see his pain and anguish paint how he approaches situations.

The hacking aspect of the game is very fun, but definitely needed to be fleshed out more, since in order for it to have a gameplay purpose there are illogical setups in the game's universe such as grenades having a wifi connection and such. Hacking could also be fleshed out more beyond being able to alter traffic lights and traffic blockers, such as your being allowed to disable cars while they are running, disabling the RFID in guns so that enemies can't shoot or even remotely operate vehicles without having to actually be in them.",08-03-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,So much hype. Not delivered,"Let me tell you about this game. So first off, the game is fun and entertaining. The story ehhhh not much. Every climax of the story or side mission just don't satisfy you at all. For example. There are these missing person missions where u find these dead body's scattered around Chicago and listen to an audio tape of a serial killer. When you find all the body's of course your going to want to kill the guy right? Maybe it will be an epic stealth mission where we try's to kill you too for maybe even kidnaps you. Well your wrong, the game programs the meeting between you too as a regular crime where u have to wait for him to confront some lady and u hit him with your nightstick and call it a day.......... That one scene basically explains the whole story part of this game. It's anti climatic or non exciting in every way. I didn't find myself gasping or on the edge of my seat at all during this whole story. Aside from that single player is nice. Chicago looks as good as it gets. They were spot on with some areas and I saw plenty of resemblance. There is so many things to do in this game that it will keep you entertained. Now for online...... That is sooooo broken that I don't even want to talk about it. If your going to do anything online keep it to the 1v1 stuff cause decryption is terrible with the lag and poor choice of weapons. The free roam mode is so bad. I don't even know why it's there to be honest",07-25-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,"A solid game worth checking out, especially on a Next-Gen Console!","Watch Dogs was #3 on my Top 5 most anticipated games of 2014 (#2 being inFAMOUS Second Son and #1 being The Evil Within). The story of the game goes like this: A brilliant Hacker named Aiden Pierce, who's criminal past lead to the death of his niece, using his skills in hacking, stealth, and with the help of other hackers, Aiden plans nothing but to track down the people responsible for the death of his niece and get his revenge. As you play the game, you have plenty of things to do as you play: the Campaign, side missions, free roam, and even online modes such as tracking players who are attempting to hack into your smartphone. The game has many things to keep the player satisfied and entertained. As you progress through the game you'll be able to upgrade your skills in hacking, driving, crafting, and weaponry. Your main weapon is a smartphone that can control the whole city of Chicago, but you also have a lot of choices of guns like regular handguns, magnums, shotguns, sniper rifles, machine guns, and even grenades. Watch Dogs was definetly a fun game to play online and offline for the campaign and is one title worth checking out. Watch Dogs is available on the Xbox One, Xbox 360, PS3, PS4, PC, and later in 2014 it will come out for Wii U. I purchased the PS4 version, which is the port I recommend the most due to the exclusive 1 hr. of bonus game play (PS3 port also has it) and it runs on a higher resolution compared to the Xbox One version (runs on 720P/30fps,1080P/30fps on PS4).",07-25-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,1,Just not good at all,"So I was very excited to grab this game because I LOVE the Assassin's Creed games (only game series I follow religiously). Plus I was a huge fan of the new Grand Theft Auto 5 game. So when the concept of the people who made Assassin's Creed were making a Grand Theft Auto style game, I was all over it. But I'm afraid to say that I just didn't like the game at all. I guess the best way to describe this game, is exactly the way that the guy at Gamestop described it to me ""It doesn't really do anything well, it's all just ok."" Nothing is more close to the truth then this. And it's VERY frustrating, because it feels like a step backwards for the company because of this. The game feels very sluggish to me, there is nothing fluid about it. From the driving to the stealth and moving around. I'm not sure if this is due to lack of attention, or simply inexperienced people working on this title. Plus another further thing that is REALLY annoying. You can't customize the controls, and the way they have some of these controls set up, you scratch your head wondering if they even realized how inconvenient some of the button placements were. An example of this is the power break being the O button and X being to look behind your vehicle (logically you'd make X your power break since it's easier to reach). Then when you go into the options menu, under control schemes, it gives you 4 total options. The default for right handed people, and THREE, count em, THREE Left handed options for Left Handed players. Let me tell you something I AM Left handed, and I would NEVER play the game with the controls they have set for lefties. I think video game developers don't seem to realize that left handed people are raised in a world designed for right handed people, meaning anything you can do with your right hand, we can pretty much do, with the exception of writing. So yea they should have focused more on giving different variations to regular right handed controls. I'd say if renting is still possible (I think they closed almost everywhere you can rent from down lol) rent it or borrow it from a friend, but do NOT pay $60 for THIS game. If you REALLY must have it, I'd say at least wait till it's under $30.",07-24-2014

There are 5 or 6 flavors of side missions, but there are 20-40+ of each of those side missions. Gets stale fast.
People walking on the street have no life to them either. There are only a handful of conversations you'll hear from them. They all react more-or-less the same to you. Even scanning people got boring because there are only a handful of occupations, or facts,  it lists for them.

I applaud them for trying something different.  But the ""hacking"" mechanic really just isn't very fun imo.  The gameplay is slow and not very engaging.  The character you play is somewhat of a wimp, without much personality, so the game ultimately just didn't spark my interest.  Good try guys, keep trying new things, but this one just didn't work (for me anyway).",07-19-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,A smart open world crime game,"As I write this, it's the summer of 2014, and Watch Dogs is a very popular game to hate.

In some ways, it deserves the hate it's getting, but that's hardly the game's fault. It has more to do with the publisher Ubisoft and the way they handled the details leading up to the game's release. A couple summers back, the crowd at E3 2012 was stunned by an absolutely gorgeous-looking trailer that revealed Watch Dogs to the world. Hype built and built over the coming year, as Watch Dogs was set to be THE definitive third party game to launch the 8th generation consoles in the fall of 2013. Unfortunately, Ubisoft delayed the game's release, and by the time May 2014 rolled around, Watch Dogs was unfairly carrying the weight of being the savior of what had been something of a dismal software launch window for the PS4 and the Xbox One. Watch Dogs was not that. In particular, Watch Dogs sure didn't look like that beautiful trailer they showed back in 2012. As a result of all this, Watch Dogs has become something of a scapegoat for not living up to what people thought it was going to be.

Once the dust settles, though, I think people will see Watch Dogs for what it really is. It's not new. It's not particularly innovative. And it sure isn't a reason to buy a PS4 or a 360. What Watch Dogs is, is a smart, enjoyable open world action game with a very cool premise, lots of intriguing things to do, and a unique approach to role playing that one rarely sees in games.

You play as Aiden Pearce, a man filled on a quest for vengeance against the criminals who killed his niece. Like with most games of this type, the story is a throwaway, and this game is no different. However, Watch Dogs has some really good things going for it. Aiden Pearce is a hacker in a future version of Chicago where the entire city runs on a privatized computer network, enabling the corrupt government to keep tabs on everyone and make sure privacy is a thing of the past. Aiden's hacking ability makes him something of a modern-day urban wizard, allowing him to control traffic lights, explode electrical grids, and make bridges rise and fall, just to name a few. While the gimmick does start to run a bit dry towards the end of the lengthy campaign, the game does a great job of giving the player a very diverse set of mission objectives that keeps things mostly feeling fresh throughout. The side stuff in the game was surprisingly fun as well, and requires you to utilize different sets of skills such as hacking together chains of security cameras to reveal secret images, tracking down human smugglers, and remotely stealing data from other hackers by keeping close amidst high speed car chases. Even the multiplayer is creatively implemented, combining the ""don't get noticed"" tactics from Assassin's Creed multiplayer with the spontaneous ""invasions"" that you see in Dark Souls.

What I liked most about Watch Dogs is the things it made me think about. As a hacker with instant access to the entire network of information flowing through the city, details about citizens' private lives, from their salaries to their secret fetishes, are available to you and allow you, in a sense, to live out a voyeuristic fantasy not seen in video games on such an intimate level. You come across a guy with a nice fat bank account available for you to hack, but then you see he's undergoing chemotherapy for stage 3 cancer. Do you steal from him? You're infiltrating a gang hideout, and see that one of the grunts has the exact same interests and ideologies as you, and is only trying to earn extra money to support his family. Do you still kill him? You have the ability, just as city officials do, to intrude on peoples' activities in their homes....do you do it? Watch Dogs presents these situations to you, but never punishes nor rewards you for making any of these decisions. It allows the player to get emotionally invested in what they're doing without forcing you to choose the ""good"" or ""evil"" option like so many other modern games do. I found this new kind of role playing to be extremely engaging, and hope to see it in more games.

Aside from the sluggish car controls, Watch Dogs controls like a dream. Aiden moves fluidly like Wei Shen from Sleeping Dogs, and the gunplay feels top notch. A pleasant surprise to me was the heavy emphasis on stealth in many of the missions, and there were often times when the game feels very much like another excellent Ubisoft series, Splinter Cell. A well-thought out upgrade system for Aiden's abilities rounds things out nicely. If you're looking for an open world game with rock-solid action, a really cool set of powers, and a new interesting take on role playing in games, consider checking out Watch Dogs. It certainly doesn't deserve most of the hate it's been getting from the gaming community, and Aiden's urban magic is a smart alternative in a genre that is starting to become a bit saturated.",07-17-2014

There is a LOT of time to be spent playing if you're a casual gamer, and it's a long game even if you focus only on the campaign portion of the game.  Certainly worthwhile on that front.
The complaints I have would be about control.  There are moments you may fall off a staircase and other moments you can't seem to vault over a counter.  Some of the other goals involving ctOS boxes can be a bit frustrating as well from the standpoint of being able to actually reach the box.

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,A mediocre attempt at something great,"After its initial reveal I admit I was hyped, the thought of a modern day Assassin's Creed with next gen graphics was something that was hard to pass up. I wasn't too hung up about graphics downgrades, since it's still very early into the PS4 generation. I was concerned about all the of the ridiculous preorder editions and the real lack of compelling story in the preview trailers, but I was ready for a Next Gen open world game so I kept my preorder despite reservations.

The experience so far, about 20+ hours in, has been pretty mediocre. WATCH_DOGS takes all of the things I really dislike about Assassins' Creed, such as bad parkour, tailing, meaningless collectibles and tower progression. It adds a hacking minigame and camera functionality, but it's not good enough to carry the game. What's especially silly is the fact that the game encourages you to use cameras and hacking to get to your objectives while remaining unseen, and then at the end of your mission it will throw in an alarm or a story point that causes you to fight all the guards you just circumvented. The further I get into the game, the more I rely on just shooting everything down and ignoring cameras and hacking, which is a bummer, especially since WATCH_DOGS adds virtually nothing to the already tired cover based shooting gameplay.

I'm trying my best to say interested enough to finish the game, but the story isn't doing anything and all the immersion breaking features that they put into the game don't even make it a satisfying escapist experience. It doesn't have the romanticism that Assassins' Creed relies on, which is why it ultimately fails to keep me hooked.

Given the success of the game sales wise, I'm sure we'll be seeing new WATCH_DOGS titles every year from now, hopefully they can improve on story and immersion, and add some real car physics and unique gameplay that isn't overpowered by gunplay. The game is a solid 3 out of 5, not so terrible that you won't want to play it, but more of a decent distraction until other PS4 games are released later this year.",07-16-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,Welcome to CTos,"Ubisoft has finally debuted their new ip, and finally they have something to accompany assassins creed on their yearly schedule. Watch dogs is a third person open world action crime drama that is somewhat reminiscent of grand theft auto. You are aiden Pearce, the vigilante, who roams the streets of a futuristic Chicago fighting crime and unraveling conspiracies. Aiden's niece is killed in a tragic drive by connected to aiden's past and he's on a revenge trip. It's a fairly generic story with some fun twists and a very strong ending. The strong point of the story is the the strong anti social media message that resounds long after the campaign ends. Some characters are very strong such as T-bone or lucky Quinn, and others not so much, like Clara Lille and, to an extent aiden. I can't help thinking that maybe if... It wasn't aiden's niece and sister, and maybe his wife and daughter, it would have a much stronger story. None the less, the story was solid and despite some lousy voice actors, most of the characters were pretty cool. The graphics are awesome, some of the best I've seen on next gen. I experienced no pop in or any other glitches. And though some of the colors are kind of drab, I feel it captures Chicago quite well. The sound is quite great, especially the gun fire. A satisfying pop and a rather gross splat. And, as I stated before, some of the voice acting is pretty spotty, while some is pretty strong t-bone probably being the best. Now on to the mechanics, the on foot mechanics are spectacular, the best I've seen science gta V. While the driving mechanics are pretty crappy, you can't shoot, you can't bank worth a crap, and because of the strict morality system it actually matters if you run down some civilians. You are primarily dependent on hacking various environmental obstacles to escape the police and incapacitate your enemies. There are also many side missions to keep you busy for a few days, but not near as many as games like gta V or assassin's creed. As someone who almost never 100%'s a game I did this one, so I imagine most folks will. Another trait worth noting is the multiplayer, that, although sometimes intrudes on the campaign is pretty fun and a new concept altogether. Basically through a system of matchmaking and connectivity, frequently allows other players to invade your game and you to invade theirs. There is also some nudity and plenty of crass language so this one is defiantly a 16+ game. Watch dogs may not quite live up to the hype, but it's defiantly a solid new series from a great publisher and I would defiantly recommend it to fans of the genre.",07-08-2014

Just the same, it is a worthwhile title. The story-line is respectable, and the control configuration seems to handle simply. I do have to add that adjusting to the process of driving a vehicle was a bit of an adaptation. With as many accidents as I caused I am surprised the citizens in the game didn't foster my demise, and what better way to be caught by the cops than  ramming your car straight into a building... even though there was nothing you were trying to avoid... you simply just couldn't steer... yeah... that stunk.",07-04-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,2,"More fun than COD ghosts, but then again, same can be said for getting your wisdom teeth removed.","I don't know about this game being like GTA or not like GTA, but it is an open world game format with guns and you can steal cars and blow stuff up. Oh, and theres also hacking FYI. The graphics are excellent and the story is okay. All of the features such as hacking and blowing stuff up are nice things to have, but the overall gameplay mechanics are horrible. For example, in the later stages of the game, you are constantly chased by an unnatural, unrealistic, and unlimited number of police officers. Thats not the worst of it, the worst of it is that you are chased by helicopters that chase you forever unless you can shoot them out, which is hard to do because the game designers failed to make it possible for you to look up. Yes, you read correctly. It is physically and anatomically impossible for ""Aiden,"" the protagonist, to look directly above him. Meaning that when these choppers get on top of you during the end game, you cannot do anything about it (that a lie, you can hope and pray that they you can move around, while being shot at by nearly 50 cops, to a position where you can look above you to try and take down the chopper.)

Most of the game you have duck and cover shoot outs which are fairly well done, however you must use a silencer, or you get overrun by enemies and thats where it gets bad. The gameplay mechanics are so terrible that you better kill your enemies from 100 yards away. If you get within striking distance of one or two enemies you are in trouble because ""Aiden"" has trouble aiming at close range. ""Aiden"" cannot look up, as discussed above, so its not too hard to imagine that for some reason, ""Aiden"" has trouble walking and aiming a gun at the same time, almost as if the game developers did not contemplate many situations where enemies would walk up to you, which is dumb, because last I checked, ""aided"" doesn't have a forcefield, people can just walk up to him and shoot him if they want. Also, just FYI, in normal mode, you die in 2-3 shots from any weapon and 1-2 shots from some of the higher end enemies. All of these enemies often take way more shots than you can. But thats just video games in general, so I suppose if they had designed the game mechanics to allow you to move like a fully functioning human being, it wouldn't be a problem. The game has a bunch of cars, but many of them are nearly impossible to drive safely. With some practice you get the hang of it or decide to stick to a motorcycle or one of 3-4 cars that actually handle well. The game can be fun at times but it is a lot of the same so it also gets stale rather fast.

UPDATE:

Beat the game. This is not Assassins Creed, don't expect a mind blowing ending. You get used to many of the quirks of the game, but all around, could have been a lot better. The side missions are more fun than the main missions, but the side missions finish pretty quickly. The gang fights were fun. While I admit it does have its positives like the graphics and some of the side missions, I still firmly believe that the game mechanics could have been much better, so the overall score of 2/5 remains, but if you want to have some senseless fun running around Chicago and blowing stuff up, than this game has plenty to like I suppose.",07-02-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,"Didn't Meet Expectations, But Not Bad","As the title of this review says, Watch_Dogs was what everyone was hoping would be a masterpiece of a game. While it isn't perfect, Watch_Dogs has a TON of content right out of the box, and while not all of it works, most of what it offers is excellent.

Watch_Dogs stars Aiden Pearce, a hacker in the city of Chicago capable of tapping into the city's various pieces of technology, which range from hacking people's bank accounts to traffic lights and bridges. The story offered in the game is a tale of revenge and sadness as Aiden struggles to avenge a death in his family. While the story has a fair share of twists and turns and is unique enough to not feel cheesy, Aiden feels like a flat character (mostly because of the same gravely Dark Knight voice) and solves most of his problems through beating information out of people the player barely knows. The story is passable, but is mostly carried by its game play.

Speaking of which, game play is excellent. Thanks to the game's excellent AI, Aiden can sneak past his enemies and deal with them quietly, or go ballistic with an arsenal of fun to use guns, or a mixture of both. Once unlocked, the player can utilize slow-mo bullet time as seen in Max Payne or GTA5.  This is a welcome addition to the game as it is incredibly useful when trying to pull off headshots on moving targets. However, game play is missing a few things. For one, why can't Aiden just randomly punch people? His arsenal contains various pistols, rifles, shotguns, and craftable hacks and explosives (which are super rewarding to use), yet he can't just give his enemies a knuckle sandwich. What's worse is the lack of the ability to shoot at enemies while driving. Instead, Aiden has use to his environment to deal with his rivals, but there are moments when just shooting out the tires of your enemies while driving would have been SO much easier. Side missions in Watch_Dogs include shootouts, infiltrating enemy strongholds (Metal Gear Solid style), but also fun gimmicks such as getting high (incredibly fun little mini games inspired by Saints Row), Chess, and Poker.

Overall, Watch_Dogs has a ton of content for the price of admission. Buy it at a reduced price for sure.",06-29-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,Assassin's Creed + GTA + 1984 = Watch Dogs,"Watch Dogs is an interesting experience. It's one part Assassin's Creed, one part Grand Theft Auto and a dash of Orwell's 1984.

The premise is that it's Chicago in the very near future (like 5 years) and you are a hacker. Smart phone technology has allowed the devices to become the hacker's tool of the trade. You're part of a two man team that goes into crowded upper class areas (Hotels, Restaurants, etc) and hack people's phones and drain their bank account into your own. One of your jobs goes awry and an unknown malcontent decides to teach you a lesson resulting in your niece being killed. You could grieve and give up your life of crime, but that's not your style. Revenge is on the menu and you're serving it cold.

Aesthetically and mechanically Watch Dogs is primarily GTA. The whole of Chicago is your playground. You can steal cars and drive them, missions frequently involve evading police. Based on your crimes the police up their force to pursue you. You can kill anyone, etc. There are no prostitutes, at least none that I have found. I always thought that was stupid and gimmicky anyway, so no love lost there.

Several things have been taken from Assassin's Creed as well. Free run and climbing is here. Although you can't climb everything like you can in AC, which makes sense, you're a hacker not an assassin. Walking around you are able to listen in on people's conversations (which often lead to side missions) and drain their bank accounts, very similar to some of the open world mechanics in AC. You can buy better equipment and use it via the weapon wheel like in AC. Even crafting grenades and other tactical devices. You have to hack these communications towers and that's what shows you where all the side quests and missions are, much like climbing the towers in AC.

Side missions include VR mini games, running down gangs that are on their way to kill someone and stopping them before they do so, tailing criminals and stopping their crimes before they hurt anyone etc. They're fun albeit a little repetitive. You're generally well rewarded with positive reputation, money and exp. If nothing else they break up the gameplay.

Watch Dogs includes several RPG elements. Most things grant you experience points. If you evade the police, you get experience. If you successfully hack something you get experience. Thwart a crime, experience. Kill a gang member with a well-placed headshot, experience. When your experience bar is full you are awarded a single skill point. You don't gain levels and I believe that the experience bar always takes the same amount to fill. Skill points are used to buy, you guessed it, skills. You have several skill trees; hacking, driving, combat, etc. Like a standard RPG you buy skills with skill points and certain skills have various requirements to unlock (your game progression, previous skills, etc). There are a lot of skills that are very useful and I'm pretty sure if you put in the time, you can unlock every single skill.

You collect money from quest/mission rewards and from draining bank accounts. Money buys better weapons, ammo, new outfits, new cars (cars can be summoned virtually anywhere as long as you own them), etc. The outfits are kinda cool and allow you to give your character a look that you prefer. Most are essentially what he's wearing on the cover in different colors and patterns.

The vehicle system is very helpful because Chicago is BIG. You can steal a car, but the alarm may go off, or someone may call 911 earning you unwanted attention. You also have a phone app that allows you to order one of the cars in your inventory from a friend who knows a guy who will park your vehicle of choice a block away from you. Every time you steal a different kind of car it will show up in this inventory. The standard low-end cars are free from the get go, the better cars cost an initial fee to fully unlock. There are A LOT of cars. Armored cars, semis, sport bikes, Ferrari's, Volkswagen, Lancers, station wagons and the list goes on. PLENTY to work with. Each handle differently and have different durability. Obviously a fiberglass sports car is going to explode faster than an armored truck.

Let's discuss combat. As I stated you have an array of weapons. Hand guns, shotguns, sniper rifle, frag grenades, signal jammers, assault rifles. You can buy them or pick them up off dead bodies. Obviously some are better than others. This works well as you can approach each situation differently. So many things can be hacked. You can daisy chain hack cameras, quickly identifying where all the enemies in the area are. Scanning them will tell you things like whether or not they'll call for backup, if they have any explosives on them, etc. You can overload circuits causing things to explode, usually killing those nearby or at least getting their attention. You can burn them by releasing steam valves. If they have grenades you can remotely detonate them. I like hanging out outside a compound and using the above mentioned tactics to kill off most of the enemies and then sneak in using the silenced pistol and sniper rifle to clean up the rest. BUT you could use a semi or armored car to blow through the front gates and hop out with your shotgun and grenade launcher an turn the place into an inferno. The choice is yours! Combat works very well as a third person shooter, I have absolutely no complaints.

Missions are put in categories by type and you have a progress wheel, much like the memory sync strands in AC that let you know how many of a specific mission you have done and how many you have left. It's a great system for the completionist.

Graphics are fantastic. They really pushed it with this one. Sound is well done, but Ubisoft has always done well with sound. The soundtrack is phenomenal, a lot of Chicago bands. Ubisoft did such an amazing job recreating Chicago. I can't stress this enough. I live in Chicago and it's a very strange experience driving on streets in the game that I do in real life.

My ONLY complaint is the same as I have with GTA. This is really just a matter of opinion and preference. I feel like the sandbox world is stronger than the overall story. I find myself frequently putting off the story so I can try different things in the open world environment. This may change as I get further into the story AND, from what I've played of the story missions, they're much stronger than anything Rockstar has every put out. Yes, I know Rockstar doesn't try to focus on the story, it wasn't a dig at them. You do feel for the protagonist and the situation he's in. I just feel that the story doesn't pull you in from the get go as much as it should. Overall though, it's a phenomenal title and Ubisoft has done an amazing job at combing elements from several successful genres into a single, solid title. If you're on the fence about this one, don't be, it's definitely worth your time.",06-28-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,I like it enough to consider future DLC content.,"I completed the storyline with in-game progress at 93.7 percent, and I have over 90 percent of the PS4 trophies locked down. I didn't know what to expect when I first started playing Watchdogs. I spent my first couple of days wondering around the open world completing side quests and learning the game. The main character is hacker, Aiden Pearce, who can use his cell phone to profile every NPC character in the game, steal money from bank accounts, and hack electric devices across the city.

Pros:

1. I spent a lot of time exploring the citys open world. The environment feels large and there a lot of fun tasks beyond the main storyline. The amount of detail found in the open world is amazing. Every citizen has a public profile that Aiden can view, and the game uses real Chicago locations. Global leaderboards keep track of your progress and compare your stats with other players.

2. The hacking system allows players to gain control the citys infrastructure. Being able to slice into security camera feeds and jump from camera to camera to hack different systems is fun. Much of the hacking is done through small puzzles that are challenging, but not impossibly frustrating. My favorite aspect of this game are the one-on-one hacking missions that pit your hacking skills against other real life players. You briefly invade another players game and get close enough to upload a virus, then you must stay undetected until a timer reaches 100 percent. As the timer ticks away the other player will try to locate and kill you. Hackers must hide or blend into the crowd to remain undiscovered. This hide and seek system creates a lot of tense moments.

3. Variety is key. There is a wide range of missions available including online hacking, gang invasions, hotspot puzzles, tracking criminals, convoy, digital trips, fixer missions, weapon trading, drinking games, murder investigations, and main storyline quests. There are 65 plus vehicles to buy and steal throughout the game. There are dozens of weapons and explosives that can be used throughout each mission. The expandable skill tree has numerous upgrade options and the games soundtrack provides decent song selection. Music playlists can be edited. Anytime Aiden jumps into a car music begins playing  anything from Alice Coopers, Dangerous Tonight, to Public Enemys, I Shall Not Be Moved.

Cons:

1. Games that require so much driving should have better driving simulators. There are vehicles that can barely be kept on the road let alone raced or used to escape a chase. The cutaway chase scenes also cause vehicle control issues. During a chase Aiden has the ability to hack traffic lights, road blocks, steam pipes, etc., which can cause pursuers to have an spectacular crash. Once a crash begins time enters slow motion and the camera spins around to view the chaos. Its fun to see the crash, but afterwards time speeds up and camera whirls around, which almost always causes a loss of vehicle control. I have crashed, been thrown off motorcycles, and failed missions because of the slow motion cutaway scenes.

2. Lag in the multiplayer hacking missions kills the game. There are game sessions that require a team to find a briefcase and hold it against another team. Good luck driving or shooting anyone when all of the players and vehicles are lag jumping across the screen. Only 20 percent of my games in this mode have been without lag.

3. Bad video game logic hurts the storyline. Aiden is suppose to be a vigilante fighting for the citizen of Chicago. He gets cellphone updates listing potential crimes to stop. So how does Aiden get to these locations? He steals vehicles. And how does Aiden acquire the money to purchase weapons to combat the violent street gangs? He steals it of course. Aiden not a likeable character and his quest isn't noble. His actions are in direct contradiction to the person the video game wants him to be throughout the story.

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,2,So much promise wasted,"I regret having purchased this game.  That's not necessarily Ubisoft's fault, although they certainly share the brunt of the blame.

This game had a lot of promise.  Ubisoft kept hammering that it would be unique gameplay with an expansive open world.  It is definitely an open world...just like every other ""open world"" we've had in the past 5 years.  There's nothing new about it.  The map is huge, but not any bigger than GTA V.  The graphics are acceptable, but not better than the AAA games for the last gen consoles.  Some of the lighting effects are wonderful; the sound and music recordings are well done.  But those things don't make up for the lack of creativity.

I have to say that the storyline was at first interesting.  And then it got boring.  And by the end, I didn't care.  Others have commented on Aiden's lack of personality.  I don't really mind that.  What I do mind is that although the gameplay is many hours long, I didn't have any reason to connect with the storyline.  It was forced and dragged out.

As for the driving simulation in this game...I disliked it immensely.  GTA V's mechanics still impress me far more.  Indeed, I kept thinking about GTA V throughout playing Watch Dogs.  And I kept suppressing the urge to stop playing WD and switch to GTA V instead.

Plenty of people have already commented on the general problems with the game.  I will now list the details that irritate me.

1.  NOT AN OPEN WORLD.  They lie.  They always lie.  FarCry is an open world--you can go anywhere and enter practically any building.  That's ""open.""  It's not open to let you drive around the city, but not permit you to enter every (or nearly every) building in the city.  Yes, that would increase the game size exponentially, but this is next gen!  If you have to split the game into 2 disks, then do it.  If you have to repeat some of the interiors, do it (actually, WD does repeat the interiors of the buildings you are allowed to enter).  Merely driving around on a big map isn't open world.  It's damn lazy.

2.  IDIOTIC AI.  Many of the missions require you to run from cops or ""fixers"" before you can complete the mission.  I tried running away and using hacking to destroy the enemy cars.  I tried shooting the enemies.  I tried juking the enemies.  Eventually, I kept resorting to this:  I found a corner somewhere, ran to it, hid behind an object, and just waited for the AI to get bored and stop looking.  Yup.  I shot 10 cops, ran over civilians, blew up a lot of stuff, and hid 20 feet from the cops.  That's how stupid the AI is.  It's lazy programming and foolish gimmicks.

3.  NOTORIOUSLY PERSISTENT AI.  There are so many damn enemies in this game.  Out of nowhere, 10 cop cars and choppers will jump on you out of nowhere.  You can't outrun them because for some strange reason, they are always faster than any care you get.  Couple this with the stupidity of the AI, and the gameplay gets frustrating very quickly.

4.  LACK OF REALISM.  No, it's not a simulation game, but surely we can get some more realism for this title?  The best way to immerse players in a game is to make it worth playing.  And if you are a vulnerable character, and have to deal with realistic injuries and physics, then you'll be more willing to play the game smart.  This game just requires you to run and gun.  Great.  Like every other game.

I am very disappointed with this game.  Shame on Ubisoft.  At least Killzone Shadow Fall had amazing graphics and a few new gameplay options.  But Watch Dogs is simply a lazy cash-in.

I'm sick and tired of companies like EA putting out terrible titles after hyping them up.  Ubisoft is on that list now, and has been on its way there for some time.

Sure, the visuals may not be what we were expecting and the hacking isn't as intricate as I would've hoped, but please give the game a chance. It will grow on you. I was skeptical because of all the reviews on the web(I even returned my launch day copy due to the average reviews). I picked the game back up and having been having a great time with it. I think GTA is a better game, but this fills the void until I can get my hands on the ps4 version of GTA 5. Id say this is a game you'd want to borrow from a friend, since it may not be for everyone.

While infamous isn't a great game, it shows how much more fun an open world can be.  There are things I like about Watch Dogs, but this game feels more like a slog, a grind, a chore.  It reminds me more of the Assassins creed games I didn't like.  The driving is bad.  The combat is okay.  The story is dull.  I think I bought this because I was desperate for PS4 eye candy, and Infamous does that much better as well.  The opening is very cool, but it has really slowed down for me.  I'll play through it, but I wish I would have waited for this one to drop in price, or for other games to come along.

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,2,Done Better Elsewhere,"Compared to GTA or Sleeping Dogs, the only thing new here is the hacking ability which just boils down to holding down a button.  It's an interesting concept to hack someone's phone or create a shortcut by hacking doors through a parking structure, but that's about all that is new here.

The characters are horrible, Aiden being so backwards as he seeks vengence for breaking the law and getting his family in trouble.  Of course he goes around stealing everyone's money, hunting down people for cash, and being melodramatic about a death he caused.  He dresses like an idiot that stands out and buying him an outfit basically just changes the color of what he's wearing.  For a talented hacker that runs around with his face covered, he even gets noticed by people around the city.

Money is worthless, it comes extremely easy and the game allows you to buy the best weapons early on without earning them so battles become a joke.  If you have to kill someone, just buy the grenade launcher and fire away, nothing will survive the torrent of raining death.  Driving is horrendous!  Forcing yourself to get used to it is not a solution.  Like Assassin's Creed, most of the sidequests repeat and the half the skills you earn feel worthless.  One of which is increased resistance to having a tire blow out.  I can't even remember when I had a tire blow out in the game.  The driving is either that bad, or it just doesn't do a good job of showing it us the gamer.  Either way, worthless.

Overall, it's just been done better somewhere else.  There are moments where things look like they can get interesting, but overall it gets repetive quick, and none of the characters make a connection to the player.  I wish I could take this back, don't waste your money.",06-20-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,Very Good Open World Game- Give it a Shot!,"I'd give Watch Dogs a 4 out of 5 or maybe a 7 or 8 out of 10 as an adult gamer. I wanted to wait until I had played it through to give it a review. My first impressions were not great- and more like some of the negative comments that have been given regarding the similarity to other games. But as I've played all of the main missions and a good bit of the side missions, exclusive missions, collecting items, etc., the game has gotten more and more fun. I found this similar to Far Cry 3 & Assassin's Creed 4. I think that it's the mark of a great game when it gets better as you go.

Yes, the game looks a lot like GTA. There are missions, car chases, etc. that look pretty GTA. There's also some of the slickness of Sleeping Dogs, along with some of its elements such as gang fights, camera hacking, etc. Then there are also parts of Deus Ex Human Revolution with network hacking. So if Ubisoft was trying to capture some of the good elements of those games- they've succeeded.

What I've grown to appreciate more about Watch Dogs is the ability to blow up streets, set tire spikes, lift bridges and other barriers to keep chasing police/enemies at bay. Yes there are too many times you have to escape via car chase, but these elements make those chases much more interesting.

The ability to hack cell phones along the street & cause problems for enemies is pretty sweet. You can really get all the money you may ever want using this pretty easy method. The hacking to open doors in missions presents challenging puzzles along the way.

Pros: The game looks great & is next Gen. It's not even close to PS3- open a PS3 game & see the difference. I like great graphics, but most truly open world games have not pushed the graphics envelope (GTA). So don't let this talk dissuade you. This is pretty low on my criteria of what makes a game that's actually fun to play.
-Wide variety of missions, side missions, collecting, secret missions, to keep you entertained.
-There's also a nice mix of stealth or more straight out shooting types of missions. The stealth elements are appropriately challenging but not impossible as in some games.

-Cons- They also try a few Saint's Row crazy side games. Maybe it's a nice change of pace for some, but those really elements don't seem to fit with the tone of Watch Dogs. I'd love some parachute, flying, or boat missions. Those are always great in the GTA games.
-There really isn't a great story as most people have related. Although I want to succeed in missions, there really isn't much giving Aiden a real sense of purpose. Again, this is pretty common in games that are this open-world.
-Initially I felt ripped off due to the similarity to other games. I can understand those who feel that way. I'd encourage those folks to keep playing to really get a sense of the scope of this game.
-For a game that took so long to get into customer hands it would have been great to see some more really original elements. What's there is good- but it could have added something more.
-This is the first Pre-sale I've bought for quite a while since most end up as disappointing. Had I waited, I may not have bought it yet due to customer reviews. It wouldn't hurt to wait until the price goes down, but it is worth a shot if you like any of these types of open-world games. Will definitely give you many hours of play & has replayability.

-Overall- I definitely recommend it. I'm not over the top as many out there who absolutely love or hate it.",06-19-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,The Most Anticipated Game of 2014 is...ok.,"So I finished this game a couple of days ago and have not gone back since. For the later months of Spring, I waited patiently and quietly for this groundbreaking game to come out. However, after playing this game for maybe 30 minutes, I quickly found out what type of game Watch dogs was. So this is my review of, in my opinion, a huge letdown of a game.

Watch Dogs, in a sense, is a newer version of GTA with hacking abilities, but sadly, Watch Dogs hasn't been able to improve upon those base controls and innovations. There are many things that Watch Dogs did that GTA did better, such as mission variation, better storyline, easier driving, and, while it may seem ridiculous, having a JUMP BUTTON. But I'll get to that later. To start off, the story in Watch Dogs is basically a book full of clichs. It has a simple, ""family member/friend is killed by bad guys, you set out to get revenge"" type storyline that, frankly, is actually kind if boring. The missions were repetitive, the storyline was longer than it should have been, and it was made of things we've seen in many other video games. Alongside the storyline are the side missions, probably the dumbest part of Watch Dogs, since you so things like stopping criminals, shooting aliens on your smart phone , playing Digital Trips, and crashing enemy convoys. However, while this is the part of Watch Dogs that is most fun, the missions are still repetitive, causing them to loose their luster after a few times you play them.

The gameplay in Watch Dogs was designed to be innovative, but it was most assuredly, a shot and a miss. For a second, think of GTA V... Think of the driving, the shooting, being able to shoot while driving... And now come back and think about Watch Dogs. Watch Dogs has none of these things; the driving is a chore, the shooting is too simplistic for a game of this caliber, and you can't shoot while driving. And to put the cherry on top, you can't jump. While this may not seem like a vital function for Watch Dogs, gives a chance to explain. If you can't jump in a game, they are simply limiting such a simplistic and human action and completely taking it out of your move set. I know it may sound absurd, but once you play it makes sense.

So that's about it really, there isn't a lot to talk about in Watch Dogs, other than to compare it to other free roam games like GTA. I had high expectations for Watch Dogs and it has been a huge let down for me. If you haven't or can't play GTA, this game is an ""OK"" alternative, but if you don't want to make it seem mediocre, don't play GTA before playing this game.  For those of you who but it, I hope you enjoy it while you have it, because after the main storyline is over, the taste of the game quickly drops. Please don't waste 50 dollars when you can go and buy much better game for less than this.

You interact with it via the coolest cell phone ever, which has the power to hack into other people's bank accounts and listen in on their conversations, or make an underground pipe explode just as pursuing cop cars drive over it. When you get into a tough spot, you can use hacking, stealth, weapons (guns, IEDs, etc.), or use all three in tandem. Variety is one of the game's strong points. Outside of the main story are some bizarre yet fun side missions called ""digital trips"" (perhaps inspired by the zaniness of ""FarCry 3: Blood Dragon""). One has you speeding through a hellish version of the city overrun by zombies, trying to hit as many of 'em as you can. My favorite has you stealthily sneaking past roaming robots with big bright lights for eyes, who will detect you if you enter their field of vision. There are 4 ""trips"" total, and each has its own skill tree just as the main game does. Other side stuff include: mini hacking challenges (usually leading to a reward), investigations (human trafficking, missing persons), playing chess or completing mini chess challenges, gang hideouts and more. There's always something to do. The best part of the online portion is the ""Souls"" inspired invasions where you hack or tail another player, or desperately try to avoid it. The main narrative may fall a bit flat, but ""Watch_Dogs"" is strikingly beautiful and endlessly entertaining.

No doubt this game was heavily influenced by GTA's gameplay, narrative, and mission styles. However, it does bring something to the table that makes it a legitimate standalone entry worthy of its own title and fan base. While the game's ""hacking"" element never really goes much beyond quick button-mashing and simple mini games, it does create a very entertaining and satisfying gameplay element which challenges you to slow down and be creative about how you progress in ways that GTA just doesn't. The more creative you are, the more rewarding (and hilarious) your antics become. This added layer takes a very little while to get used to, but before long you're experiencing a whole added dimension to the way this kind of game has played before. Honestly, this is the game Rockstar SHOULD have released in GTA V...which was a complete letdown imo (just more of the same, no different than GTA IV).

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,"Not just a ""GTA clone"" with 'downgraded' graphics.","TL;DR VERSION AT BOTTOM

First off, I am happy to say this is my first review for a PlayStation 4 game. Also, let me state that I decided to buy this game only 4 days before the release date, as I didn't really care for it before. To clarify- I was never really hyped for Watch Dogs, and I took a risk buying it on launch day, not knowing if it was going to be worth my $65. What was the result? Just keep on reading.

Gameplay:
Simply, Watch Dogs' genre can be boiled down to a sandbox action game-similar to Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed games (which I've played two of six games). From what I've heard, many gamers are calling Watch Dogs a ""GTA clone"", or a ""modern day Assassin's Creed"". I can only go as far to say that the only similarity I see in these arguments are the simple concepts of sandbox games: you are  allowed to run around the world and explore, and cause trouble (if you decide to) between missions. The giant, obvious difference that Watch Dogs has over GTA and/or Assassin's creed is that you can manipulate the city's (set in Chicago) technology with your phone. Watch dogs does have guns, and does car chases, but the game is all centered around your control in the ""CtOS system"", which is Chicago's central security system--you could say. You can hack phones and look at all the NPC's lives, hack cameras (which is a big feature in Watch Dogs), traffic lights, bridges, etc. When hacking a device, you usually have to go into the network and play a ""pipe game"" (complete the flow through pipes)  to successfully hack into something, which are pretty easy, and can get kind of hard sometimes. In Watch Dogs, you are not forced to go on machine gun rampages, if that's not your thing. When I began playing this game, I was afraid that it was all centered around stealth (and I am not the best at stealth games). While you have this option (and as it IS mandatory sometimes), Watch Dogs makes the stealthy route a fun, strategical route, as you can mess with enemies by hacking several pieces of technology and craft items useful to distract or kill enemies.  Besides the main gameplay, there is quite a bit more you can in Watch Dogs. As boring as it sounds, you can play minigames, one of the many is Chess (challenges or a full game), complete investigations, and do side missions of course. Before I write a 8-page college essay on just the gameplay, I'll finish up saying there are also crazy ""Digital Trips"" (that are nothing like the regular game!), and ""Cash Runs"". If I haven't convinced you already, there is A LOT you can do in this game, if you are not one solely for the campaign (which is pretty long, may I add).

Story (finally!):
I have not finished the story yet (though I've had it spoiled for me already). To save you from any spoilers, the story basically puts you in the shoes of a clearly adept hacker named Aiden Pearce, as he used to use his skills for crime (at least that's what the first cutscene seemed to show). The game's story progresses into big investigation to find who killed Aiden's daughter, and find justice, and at the same time, learn more about CtOS, and how it is corrupt. I can't really say anything else, but it is a relatively simple and fun story, and again, not some GTA clone.

Graphics/Sound:
As I said, I was never very hyped for this game (at least until the few days before launch). It seems like many fans turned this game down because the graphics shown in E3 were not nearly as good as the graphics in-game. My thoughts? They look fine! Though we are in the nex-gen console age, we must realize that we cannot just rely on crystal clear graphics in a game. For the PlayStation 4, the graphics COULD be better, but they already look very good. I understand there are people out there that want the best looking games out there, but Watch Dogs looks good enough. In my honest opinion, I'd rather trade better performance for for worse graphics any day. If I can see what's going on, that's fine with me. Simply get a nice gaming PC to play the game on Ultra if you want good graphics. One thing that really stands out for me, however, is the graphics of the steam pipe hack (which you can obtain later in the game). It looks really cool when you activate it, and the blur and particle effects look amazing.

Watch Dogs' sounds are pretty solid for me. There is nothing too special and nothing really stands out. Like many sandbox games (modern day at least), you can control a radio with real music attached, and there is a good chunk of songs that I enjoy, other than that, the city ambiance sounds fine. On a funny note though, when you commit a crime around civilians, everyone disperses, and you can hear an echoed scream throughout the city, which sounds pretty cool. (the sound itself, not the actual screaming).

Online:
I have not delved too deep into the multiplayer, but it is active as you play the game in single-player (you can disable it if you choose). Basically, the main features of multiplayer includes online hacking, tailing, decryption, racing, and free roam. The game introduces some of the online features to you in the game with bots, but when it comes to real people playing against you, all I can say is good luck. You can level up by successfully completing online contracts, thus gaining ""reputation"", but in turn (which is the one gripe I have), you lose reputation if you lose in the contract, and sometimes, players are unfair and make it very annoying to find them in Hacking. I've only been hacked twice, I plan to do more once I finish up with the main game. Apart from the online contracts, there are city hotspots you can visit and 'interact' with other players, and if you check in the most times in a week at a spot, you become mayor (which I do not know what it gives you). I find the whole hotspot feature unnecessary, and frankly, kind of dumb. Lastly, one of the side missions are called ""Fixer Contracts"", that are single player, but allow you to compete online for bragging rights of leaderboards for each fixer contract (I actually am in the top 5 for the interceptor contract called ""Rogue Data"" on the PS4, search for UA1gr3MMU5_K3Z).

Other:

-Controls:
Controls are pretty simple, but there are a few buttons I'd like to change around, as the reload button is R3, and some actions are mapped to the same button (given if you are driving or on foot), but the controls are not bad--they take some getting used to.
-World:
Chicago is very big, or at least when I began playing the game. I play Just Cause 2, and that world is insanely big. After playing for a while, it's not as gigantic as I thought, but still pretty vast.

If you are on the fence for this game, and don't really care for graphics, but care for a large game with a lot to do, I highly recommend this game. It's not the best sandbox I've played, but I love the concept, and I haven't gotten bored with it yet!

Gameplay: Sandbox game centered around hacking, and tons to do.

Story: Aiden Pearce learns about more CtOS and wants to find justice for things done to his family

Graphics: graphics are fine, stop complaining!

I like to get lost in the story, not simply mash buttons to rack up scores. Watch Dogs delivers just that -- a great plot and storyline with great voice acting.

Graphics: Great graphics, and lovely visuals, even though they were degraded since first previewed at E3 (and I believe this degradation included the PC version). Perhaps there were frame-rate issues that needed to be improved upon, and thus the graphics took a hit to compensate.

Gameplay & Controls: For the most part good and responsive, but there were some issues with the driving and even some of the crouching behind barriers. Overall good gameplay.

This game did have some holes and weak points, but one comparison for Watch Dogs would be the first Assassin's Creed game. The first Assassin's Creed game got mixed reviews but many said showed promise, which would need to be polished up. And Assassin's Creed ended up becoming a very popular franchise as the games did improve. That's somewhat the case for Watch Dogs -- a great game that has various faults, but it does show promise to be improved upon for sequels to come.

It's basically just Grand Theft Auto with elements of Splinter Cell. That being said, it seems to work when both are together. However, a lot of the missions are repetitive or redundant; doing the same sorts of things over and over, making the missions seem recycled just to make the game longer. It does require strategy and stealth though, so I'll give it that.

Overall, if you like Grand Theft Auto, open world games, action shooters or stealth, this is worth picking up. The hacking isn't as amazing as the hype made it seem, but it's interesting to say the least. I got it for $30.07 from GameFly and I think that's all it's worth, personally.

If you can clear your mind of all the hype leading up to its release.","After you and your buddy cause some trouble at a Chicago stadium, you get your first shot at hacking and cut the place's power so that you can sneak out amid the ruckus.  Admittedly, that first moment when you exit the stadium and get introduced to the open city feels big.  But the game - which for the past 2 years was hyped as THE next generation game - collapsed under it's own ambition.

Don't get me wrong - it's a good game.  I wouldn't give it 4 stars if it stunk.  But as I mention in the title, you really have to forget about what you hoped this game would be; otherwise, you'll find yourself disappointed.

I won't go into every detail of the game; you can easily find those details in any major online review.  But I do want to quickly touch on some of the good and not so good that mattered to me:

 The game is pretty.  Although it's not a jaw-dropping next-gen visual masterpiece (probably due at least partly to it's accommodation of previous-gen technologies), it undoubtedly is nice to look at.  It's important to note that the PS4 version enjoys a graphical advantage to the Xbox One version.

 The game is innovative.  Props to Ubisoft for taking a bold step toward doing something new - a rare feat these days.  A sandbox game centered around hacking is a cool idea that hasn't been done in a meaningful way until now.

 That being said, the hacking has really been diminished to holding a single button on the controller.  The novelty of it quickly wears off and the innovation is trumped by tediousness and repetitiveness.

 What makes up for the overly simplistic hacking mechanics is the extensive skill tree.  Dozens of upgrades are available across 4 categories: hacking, combat, crafting, and driving.  I always love a good skill tree.

 Driving.  I put a plus in front of this as more of a ""neutral"" because everyone seems to be knocking the driving mechanics.  Yes - it's not as good as grand theft auto.  But had I not seen every review complaining about driving mechanics, I probably wouldn't have  even given it a second thought.  It's really not that bad.

 The AI isn't best-in-class.  Two specific examples:  1) Cops are easily escapable by hiding in the park/water, and 2) You can get into a pedestrians face without a reaction.  The latter is especially annoying to me for some reason.  I keep thinking of GTAs decency of at least giving me a ""Get out of my face!""

Platform: PS4

Pros:

 Hacking anything and everything wherever you go never gets old.

 The combat and general gameplay  is amazingly fun.

 Crazy and eccentric characters keep the story interesting.

 The game looks and runs very well.

 There is a ton of diverse, and unique content aside from the main story to pursue.

 The voice actors do a fantastic job.

Cons:

 Aiden Pearce ultimately feels pretty generic as a protagonist.

 All vehicles behave as if they are being driven on a solid sheet of ice.

 The ""Stealth Car Missions"" may have sounded cool in theory, but ultimately they are just frustrating.

Conclusion:

  Watch_Dogs probably won't feel like the game you had been anticipating since the reveal at E3. It doesn't look quite as good as what was teased, the story isn't as epic as we thought it would be, and Aiden Pearce isn't a very interesting character overall.

  However, this is by no means a 'bad' game. In fact, the game is a blast! It's been described by many as a love child spawned from Assassin's Creed and GTA. But, if you're like most gamers, that should sound awesome to you. It's not what was promised admittedly, but it's still worth picking up in my opinion. I'd definitely recommend checking it out, and if you're really on the fence about it, give it a rent and decide for yourself if it's worth $59.99.

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,"Great game, be weary of the naysayers","Perhaps old age has tempered my expectations (I turned 40 last week), but I don't feel any sense of let down after 10+ hours of  roaming the streets of Chicago.  Given the enormous expectations gamers have expressed, it's easy to see why so man people have felt let down.  Expectation is the precursor to disappointment, sadly.  In that light, take these one and two star reviews with a grain of salt.  No, it's not perfect, but no game is.

There's been a lot of discussion about graphics.  To my eyes it's a gorgeous game, especially on the ps4.  It doesn't top InFamous Second Son, but it's still a beautiful rendition of Chicago.  A lot of the game mechanics appear to be borrowed from Ubisoft's stable of games:  hacking from Deus Ex, the cover system from Splinter Cell, etc., but they've all been integrated rather nicely.  I found the controls largely fluid, at least while on foot and during gun play. The voice acting was solid, the soundtrack acceptable, and there's simply a ton of stuff to do. 10 hours in and I haven't even completed a Act 1.

There are, however, plenty of mis-steps in my estimation.  Yes, the driving is atrocious.  Prepare to fishtail...everywhere.  The lack of customization is surprising, whether it be clothing, cars, or anything else.  I noticed little things, like the time not showing on your smart phone/profiler, which struck me as odd.  I had some major frame rate drops during the intro mission, too.  The missions can be very challenging, so prepare to die and fail a lot.

There's a great sense of paranoia running through Watch_Dogs, especially when other players can hack your game.  We live in a world where virtually no one appears to have any right to privacy:  the NSA, spying, hacking, data centers (I drive past the Bluffdale, UT data center everyday), wi-fi everywhere. There's no way to protect yourself.  Someone's always just a click away from digitally intruding on our lives.  In that regard, Watch_Dogs has plenty to say about modern society and the big, wide gray areas we all inhabit.

I've enjoyed this game a lot.  Give it a try.  Give in to the paranoia.",06-04-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,best game for new-gen,"SO FAR so good graphics are amazing gameplay and storyline is great  better then any other games of its kind such as GTA, Saints Row and etc",06-04-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,1,"Boring, Repetitive, and Excruciatingly Awful Singleplayer and Multiplayer","1. The storyline is boring.

It failed to spark my interest and keep me interested. I finished 15% of the storyline and couldn't force myself to keep going. I just don't care about avenging the death of Aiden's niece. I don't care about finding the mastermind who wants to hack Aiden. I've played the game for about 10 hours and I just can't handle it anymore. It will be collecting dust on my shelf. I've had more fun with Call of Duty Ghosts singleplayer and muiltiplayer even though that's a really craptastic game.

2. The game is extremely repetitive.

How about that annoying grunt (oomffff, ooomff, like they're choking on something hard and stiff) enemies make every time you get spotted? Annoying yet? Don't worry, it'll get there. Speaking of getting spotted, isn't Watch Dogs really just one big game of hide and seek? Fixer contracts, gang hideouts and stopping crimes are fun the first three times. Then it just gets boring and repetitive.

3. Multiplayer is disgustingly bad.

Multiplayer, as far as I'm concerned, doesn't exist. If I could grade it lower than 1 out of 10, I would. Truth is, this game is meant for single player only. If you think you will have fun with multiplayer, YOU ARE WRONG. Trust me. You are DEAD wrong. When you hack somebody, nothing happens. You hide like a little girl while they're running around like morons trying to find you. At first, you impishly giggle at the other player's stupidity since they've passed where you are about 10 times and still haven't found you. Then the meter reaches 100%, you've hacked them! Wohooo, congratulations. So what happens after you hack them? Oh yeah, you disappear, they disappear, you two lose connections, and you get some points. Whoop dee doo. You get hacked, you lose points. Whoop dee doo. Nothing happens. BORING. What else? Oh yeah, you can't kill other players in multiplayer no matter how many times you throw a bomb or shoot them in the face. Stupid. What is there to do in multiplayer? Online racing? Retarded. Online hacking? Don't get me started. Competing with other players? Doubly retarded. Oh, and it takes forever (1-5 minutes) to load and find a player to hack and to join a lobby. Ain't nobody got time for that, dawg.

4. Watch Dogs is a GTA Rip-off, and not nearly as good.

Whoever said Watch Dogs is not a GTA rip-off hasn't played Watch Dogs. Really dude? You think it's not a copy of GTA? It is, only with a fancy cell phone that can hack things. You hack cameras and spot enemies before they spot you. Wow, right? Sounds innovative! No, it's dumb, not innovative. Scenario time. Let's say I'm in a mission, a fenced enemy base. There are 20 enemies inside, cameras everywhere in the building. Cool. I jump the fence, hack the cameras, identify the enemies. Now I am expected to pick them off one by one, all 20 of them. Hack their gadgets, make their bombs go off, hack electrical panels, basically do anything that can stealthily kill them. Time spent beating the mission while in stealth mode: 15 minutes. Now how long do you think it will take me to beat the same mission if I hack their cell phones, disable their calling of reinforcements, and pull out my freaking Ak 47? Like 5 minutes. Now why the HELL should I spend 3x as much time trying to be a sneaky little bee when I can just finish the mission much faster Al Pacino style? Ain't nobody got time for that. I got dishes to wash clothes to dry. Mission complete either way. No extra rewards for killing the enemies in a stealthy fashion. The point to my little scenario is, I find my brain wanting to go GTA mode. I am programmed to go Arnold Schwarzenegger and just kill everything that moves as quickly and efficiently as possible, baby. I learned hacking sucks and I don't like it. The point is, Watch Dogs is just GTA minus a little GTA plus hacking. Same old same old.

5. The Graphics are terrible for a PS4 game. Some ps3 games have better graphics (think The Last of US). Watch Dogs does not run in 1080p as promised.

6. Exploring the world of Chicago is not as fun as it sounds.

It is boring. Boringly boring. Boringly boringly boring. Boringly boringly boringly boring, if you get my meaning. I find myself driving my fancy sports car hacking street lights and steam pipes, causing car accidents and being a total douche to the people of Chicago. And not one of them calls the police. Not one of them knows that I did it. Tee hee. Yet, when I pull out my gun and start run by shooting random civilians, only a few people call the police, and if I get to them in time by shooting them the phone hangs up and the police don't show up. I just get away with murder. Cool story, bro. And what about the effects on my reputation? I could care less. I found myself bored so many times with the missions and side-missions in this game, I pulled a Columbine massacre on a number of occasions. This game will do that to you. It will bore you to death and make you wonder what happens if you just start killing random civilians. Even that is boring. The police chase you, a fancy helicopter sniper pops by for dinner, and my AK 47 is invited. GTA Rip off, yet again. And MUCH MUCH WORSE.

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,Average. Ok game.,"This game is ok. The main character is very contrived and uninteresting. The story is about the same. Kinda feels like a cheap GTA. I enjoyed it but man, it did NOT deserve the pre-game hype it got. It's ok at best. Looks like a PS3 game. Nothing really next gen about it. Underwhelmed.",06-03-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Nextgen Started off right!,"This game had all the anticipation behind it with the makers of AC behind it. So much to do in city to keep you busy, and really brought nextgen graphics!",06-03-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Give it a chance- It grows on you,"I held off on doing a review on this game because I wasn't really sure if I would like it, and I didn't want to do like many and give a bad review because I didn't understand or get into it deep enough.

This game is awesome Plain and simple.

Its not perfect because like many games, when they get so complex and detailed, sometimes the control mechanics can be cumbersome and takes some adapting to use the controls. I have seen where people are saying its a combination of Grand Theft Auto and Assassins Creed.  I can see why this comparison is made, but this game is much BETTER than both for a few reasons. The first reason is that it is not a sequel series.
  I am a firm believer that game sequels have a tendency to go stale unless they are online multiplayer formats. The whole hacking genre of this game is pretty sick. Like I said, it took a few missions to really get into it, but I am getting addicted to it quickly.
  The free roam capability that is comparable to GTA is much more advanced. I think the next generation development has allowed the game to literally allow the player to go where they want. The interactive environments are really awesome. You knock trash cans over when you are running through alleys, you can drive through chain link fences when eluding police, etc. Thats another thing, The police pursuits are exciting! The cops aren't as easy to outrun like they are in GTA. The AI is far superior.  You have to rely on the expanding free roam environment and hacking into traffic systems to get away.  Which brings up the issue of controlling vehicles. The vehicle driving mechanics could be better, and I find myself losing perspective when hitting high speed turns because the camera angle puts you in blind spots. When you make vehicles crash behind you, the slow motion camera capture of the crash is cool to watch, but the down side when the perspective returns to you, you can sometimes crash yourself because the view returns you to a bad spot. But I can live with this because the game has so many strengths that outweigh this. My solution is to use the available motorcycles. They are smaller and more nimble and easier to get through traffic . Not to mention, its easier to ride a motorcycle between barriers that you trigger during police pursuits.

The hacking puzzles are top notch, and makes the hacking theme seem more realistic. And people need to realize that Watch Dogs is not some boring hacking puzzle game. It is packed with high paced shootouts which are reminiscent of Max Payne on PS3, but with next gen detail. The graphics are amazing. The roads and sidewalks have cracks and stains and the leaves on the trees, the rain drops and the appearance of the roads when they are wet.  You can definitely tell this is a game on a next gen console.

This is a game that grows on you the more that you play it.",06-03-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,1,I Can Not Recommend This Game,"The short version: Anyone saying that Ubisoft vastly under-delivered on what they promised is telling you the truth.

Everything else you need to know: The engine and the framework of the game is perfectly fun, but the entire experience is washed over by the insultingly bad writing and character development. By the end of the play through you start to realize that there are entire sections of game that you expected by watching all of the previews and yet never got to experience.

The Joseph DeMarco scene could specifically be called out as a prime example of what the Ubisoft team promised, however, that scene was almost entirely cut out and what was left was hastily re-used and written over for some completely left-field mouse character that holds zero relevance to the plot and serves only to distract and confuse the entire story.

A pure example of flimsy character development would be Aiden Pearce's original motivation, which is to pursue someone in anger after they made threats about a family member. Aiden Pearce's first move, then, is instantly to threaten that character's family members without ever caring that that was the very kind of action that had driven him to action in the first place.

The other characters are reduced to worn out stereotypes and tropes, and the Ubisoft team was apparently not afraid to seem racist or sexist in their characters. I can only count one female character who isn't brutalized by violence, and she is in the game for maybe 60 seconds. She's supposed to be a psychiatrist, but she's used only as a babysitter. There are zero non-white characters who aren't portrayed as uneducated violent thugs.

In the end this game boils down to the hardcore repressed teenage white male power fantasies that Hollywood has been shamelessly spitting out for ages. At the end of the game all of the heroes are white and all of the women and minorities are dead or forgotten.",06-03-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Watch Dogs,Watch Dogs for the playstation 4 is a great game and i can recommend it to anyone that have a playstation 4 with them or even if they are planning to get one in the future.,06-03-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,All honesty,Now lets me start off by saying this game if pretty great. It isn't perfect but for a start I do love the game. If I had to say what types of games Watch dogs is I would say it has elements of assassin creed and farcry. Now after the Ezio trilogy I had enough with assassins creed was stupid and it went to the point where each mission told you how to kill someone of complete the mission that's a poor decision for open world game. Now watch Dogs mission are a little repetitive but I have no problem with that after all every game has repetition that's to be expected but if you like a techy aspect this game is super fun. You can play this game anyway you want to and it really captures open world well. Even has a little infamous touch to it. you can basically be good or not give a crap about the people of Chicago. The more work you put into being good then the more people will understand your good and will do less to hinder you. now story time. the story is different after all its about the murder of his niece that was his fault but he wants retribution. My brother thought the story was dumb because it didn't atleast talk about his family and to that I say BS. the story the way it is totally more believable. The type of guy Aiden is he wouldn't be able to maintain a family I believe that more then if he actually had his own family and the love of his niece that loved him like a father touched my heart and Aidens mission quickly became my own and I really wanted to solve this mystery and get Aiden his revenge. Overall I would recommend this game some will hate it but that's because it isn't their type of play like hardcore RPG people,06-02-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,"Not GTA,  doesn't have to be.",Great game.  Fresh take on open world mayhem.  Online is fun but still a little slow to match make.  Tons of extra stuff to do and explore.,06-02-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,Good entry into the sandbox style genre,"This is a very unique entry into the sandbox style genre. Game play revolves around ""hacking"" into just about anything which makes combat very interesting as well as driving around the city. The story is engaging enough to continue through the campaign, but I actually find myself playing the side missions more than anything which focuses more on various game play mechanics (driving, shooting, hacking, etc.). One of the more interesting things the game takes advantage of is real world players hacking into your game or you hacking into theirs which consists of police chases (you or they control police) or various hide and go seek challenges. There are some driving mechanics that I'm not a fan of (easy loss of traction and difficulty steering) which GTA does much better, but overall the game is a lot of fun. The shootouts can be particularly awesome when bystanders and police get caught up in the gang warfare. I anticipate sequels which will keep the good and improve upon the bad. Pick this up and I think you'll enjoy!",06-02-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,Honest review after finishing the game,"I finished the game 2 days ago and spent some time with side missions & multiplayer, so now it's time to write what I think about this game.

Game Play: It's a fun game ! you get around 14-16 hours of gameplay by just playing the campaign. I really enjoyed the campaign. There are total of 5 acts, 6-15 missions in each act. Smooth movement and hacking gives this game a nice & refreshing feeling. 9/10

Driving: Not the strongest point of the game! 70% of the game is mainly focused on the hacking & stealth. Driving takes time to get use to, but after you learn how to drift cars, you can't stop driving. However, the damage to the cars are terrible. You go full speed to an incoming car, and just bounce back with little to no damage. Each car handles differently, and even sounds different, I like that! Biggest down side, there is no way to store cars or repair them, not even a simple color change :-( Big mistake 6/10

Voice acting/music/sounds/ characters: Perfect 10/10 voice acting of aiden pearce reminds me of Sam Fisher and Max Payne + jack bauer

Side missions: After I was done with the game, I kinda lost interest. Simply because there is nothing for you to explore. Every side mission and hidden things are shown on the map. You just choose one and the GPS will get you there. There are tons of side missions to do, but they get really boring and repetitive after a while. For example, Criminal Convoy missions are just simply following a car and taking it out, or Gang hideout is just taking bunch of gangs and taking down the main objective.... they all get really boring after the 10th time. Other hidden things that you can do involve hacking cameras and spying on people. 8/10

Multiplayer: It's fun and broken! So far I hacked 10-12 people/ got hacked 6-7 times and was able to find 1 Race and 3 decryption matches. Finding a game takes a long time, and when you find 1 it's really lagy. 1 Vs 1 hacking is fun & nicely done, but Race &  decryption are really lagy and messy. Modes: 1VS1 Hacking, 1VS1 Trailing, decryption( deathmach/Team deathmach ), Race. Again, they are fun, but I spent more time trying to find a game than actually playing one. Players are not from U.S. You go against players from China and U.K. so expect huge lag. 7/10

Stop comparing this game to GTA. it's not even close to GTA. I would say, Assassin's Creed + True Crime Or Splinter Cell + Sleeping dogs. Not GTA

Buy this game, you will enjoy it. Stop comparing it to other games. Campaign worth 60$ itself + other things you can do. Don't buy the season pass !

I'm taking one star off just because there is absolutely nothing to do in the game after you are done with the side missions. Only thing you can do is to take care of criminals. That's it... no more shooting. If you shoot one bullet, people call cops. It's not acceptable. I finished the main missions in 12 hours. Side missions gave me another 7-8 hours, now there is nothing I can do.

Update: June 23

Online Hacking: it's getting annoying so I have to mention this here. Some people disconnect their internet when you are about 90% hacking them, so you get zero points. Also, some people get bounty on themselves by hacking NPCs and wait for you in car to show up. They know you are coming; so they just shoot you before even starting the hack.

(Personal Opinion): Don't buy this game over PS-network because it gets really repetitive. I really want to trade this game, but I got it on Ps-store.",06-02-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,It's pretty good...,"At first I thought this game wasn't all that.  After putting some good hours into it I am glad to say that it's a good, fun and enjoyable game.  The city has a ton of detail, driving is fun, shooting and gun fights are cool.  The story and acting is fun to watch and keeps you interested.  It has a TON of side content that earns you trophies and is fun to complete.  I am about 50% through the campaign and so far I have enjoyed it.",06-01-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Absolutely Outstanding,"I definitely had my doubts about this game before I bought it due to the graphics controversy and the release date delay. However, it truly is a phenomenal game. Story, graphics, gameplay, and depth are all great. The water graphics are the best I've seen in a game. Basically, GTA V but just way better.",06-01-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Probably the best game right now for PS4,"I decided to get this for my ps4 since my last purchase was for the Xbox one, It's a great game, not quite as much to do as GTA, but a different and fun take on the open world environment. It's the kind of game you can beat and still play for hours.",06-01-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,Decently fun...,"And that's the problem.  The game is fun, but not amazingly so.  Which, I think is what needed to happen...considering the game is not particularly emotionally draining nor does it draw the player into its story as well as many other games.  So, lacking this depth, it would have to make up for it in fun-factor.  It doesn't accomplish this as thoroughly as would be required, then.

I hadn't really bought in to the hype.  But, that doesn't mean I hadn't followed the hype and news.  I felt like I knew exactly what I was getting myself into, and it was partly what I thought it would be; unfortunately, however, it was not nearly as an intelligent or thought-provoking game as I'd hoped or was partly led to believe.  I'm not ""minusing a star"" for things like this, I just feel that this game could have and should have been better, given the unique premise and open world.

It was difficult when choosing the number of stars I wanted to tack on to the game.  I feel like I'd like a 3.5, but I suppose it says something then that I would've rounded down if that was the case.

Obviously I have not gone in to gameplay specifics... but that is because so many others have already.  I am giving you an honest opinion after playing the game for about 12 hours.

EDIT: So, I played the game for another 3 hours today.  Well, I definitely stand by my previous rating.  One's mastery over traffic lights only gets one so far in life.",06-01-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,So AWESOME,"Take my honest advice and don't listen to all those haters, this is an amazing game! I have enjoyed every second of it, and immediately bought the season pass after my first night of gameplay. I highly recommend this to any fan of action/adventure, free roam, rpg, 3rd person shooter games.",05-31-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,Looks and plays great but not for everyone.,"I loved playing games like the last Tomb Raider and Infamous Second Son. I didn't like GTA IV, Saint's Row III, Assassin's Creed III, or IV. Game looks beautiful and sounds great. Play control is OK. The driving itself is OK. I was excited to pick this up at launch, Didn't enjoy it personally. Gave a few more nights and still didn't excite me. Just not my style of pace and type. My other 2 friends had the exact same opinion. All 3 of us sold it. Not that bad but just not my cup of tea. Looking forward to The Last of US remake now.",05-31-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Gotta give it a try,"The only downside about this game is graphics.  When I was playing Knack and Killzone Shadow fall, graphics blew my mind away though the game-play was just mediocre. When I was playing this game, for example, Aiden's sister Nicky's face was clearly last gen's graphics, with hair look so blurry. I guess that's what happens when the game is developed cross-gen. But the graphics alone is not enough for me to bring it down to a four star game.

Besides graphics, the gameplay is awesome. Shooting and driving are very smooth. I just want to finish the campaign as fast as possible so I didn't bother hacking other players, though I myself got hacked three time and I killed the hacker just once.  The puzzles are really simple; just look for the cameras and it will solve everything. I personally don't like complicated puzzles because when I play, I want to enjoy, not use my brain to work out something. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed.

For the purpose of better graphics, I really look forward to next gen only games, like Assassin's Creed Unity.",05-31-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,Underwhelming.... Okay Game,"So I have been playing now for about 3-4 hours and has reached the 4th main campaign mission of the story. So I expected far more from this game. The number complaint and issue of this game is the driving. It is not the best driving. Everytime you press R2 to accelerate it always set to max. It is kinda annoying. E brake does not work as expected. It is hard to drift in a motorbike even if it's the best vehicle to drive in the game. Once you finish with the intro mission the world is open to you right away and have access to all the mini games and side missions. That's a good thing because I immediately started doing other things besides the main missions. I find the overall game sorta boring and nothing new except for the hacking which basically is controlled by one button. You would think they can ""hacking"" would be more complicated than just hitting one button like an instant App you just downloaded from the Appstore but I am not the developer of this game and not a real hacker myself. The city is not that lively or organic, the peoples profile is sure full of perverts and weird sexual fantasies. Its kinda weird that the writers of this game can think of some of the ridiculous things that I have read so far. Most definitely an adult game.

Graphics are fine for a PS4, there is some texture pop in sometimes, I expect that already from a Ubisoft game. I am not feeling a connection or excitement from other games I played like Infamous Second Son, GTA 5 or The Last of Us that keeps me playing all night long trying to fight my sleepiness just for one more mission. This is all subjective and anecdotal ofcourse so feel free to ask me a question about this game.",05-30-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Loving the game so far. There are solutions to driving issues...,"Love the open world and graphics. there were two issues early on: police chases and driving. Found solutions to both:

--police chases: like AC4, go to water and swim. drive to a bridge, get out of your car, and jump into the river. swim till they go away. almost EXACTLY like being chased in Assasins Creed 4

--driving: I should say I hate driving in most games, GTA5 included. Solution: motorcycle. Its a blast, and you have none of the driving issues you may have with cars",05-30-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,Satisfied with purchase,"When I picked this up, I wanted to make sure I gave it a chance before I wrote a review.  Too often, people pick up a game (especially one as hyped as this) and render a verdict after five minutes of playing. I will admit, Watch Dogs didn't initially win me over.  First, I was slightly disappointed with the graphics.  Now, don't get me wrong, the graphics aren't bad, but after being spoiled by Infamous Second Son, the next-gen graphics bar has been set pretty high.  I realize a cross platform game won't be as optimized as an exclusive, so I won't judge Watch Dogs too harshly on that alone.  Besides, the open Chicago world environment in Watch Dogs is still amazing, just not better than Seattle in ISS.  It's a little drab and not as lush and colorful as Seattle, but it's my understanding that this was intentional.  My next complaint is the driving.  Yes, it's true, the vehicle control is horrible. Cars handle about as clumsy as a supermarket shopping cart.  Motorcycles handle much better but obviously can't take as much damage.  Despite the horrible handling, I managed to get just good enough at driving.  However, that horrible handling still rears its ugly head from time to time, usually when you're involved in a high-speed pursuit and trying to multitask by hacking gates, poles, and traffic signals while driving.

As for the rest of gameplay, the story gets started relatively fast.  The initial plot development happens pretty fast without an overly lengthy cut scene.  The hacking was a little confusing at first as you'll initially feel a little information overload when scanning for nearby devices to hack.  I guess I know how General Zod and Superman felt prior to training their senses in Man of Steel.  Eventually, I got the knack for scanning and found it very effective for finding nearby assets.  The other controls: running, shooting, crouching and looking around, are the usual fare if you've ever played an open world game.  I have no complaints with controls other than driving. The tutorial system is pretty straightforward and sticks around long enough for you to get accustomed to the controls. Most menus are easily accessed with one button and sub-menus are navigated with the analog sticks.  In addition to helping you defeat or escape foes, hacking is also quite comical at times as you see the deepest secrets of everyone around you revealed.  Some of the secrets are a little dark but that just adds to the realism.

As far as the missions, I don't find them boring or repetitive at all.  I actually enjoy side missions.  For $60, I don't want to hard charge through a game and complete it in a few days.  I want as much interaction as possible.  I'm the type who prefers to complete all the side-missions before clearing a primary mission. In that regard, Watch Dogs satisfies my thirst to explore and find different things to do before continuing along the primary arc.  There is more than enough to keep you busy for a while if you like exploring.

I had a tough decision.  It came down to buying this or Wolfenstein.  Ultimately, I decided on Watch Dogs after reading several reviews posted by people who completed Wolfenstein fairly quickly.  The general consensus was that it was an awesome game, just short.  That made the decision of deciding which game to buy now and which one to wait for a price drop a much easier one for me.  I really like Watch Dogs.  While I don't feel it quite lives up to the massive hype, and anything seldom does, it is very fun and, most importantly, I want to keep playing whenever I can.  For me, that is the true value of a game.  For instance, I bought Killzone two months ago, played a few hours the first week or so and had no urge to return.  I just didn't find the campaign very interesting or engaging enough. Multiplayer was much better but I prefer solo campaigns.  The solo campaign of Watch Dogs is very satisfying so far.",05-30-2014

You can do so many things in the city from looking at landmarks, which give you rewards if others left gifts there, outrunning cops (but can control traffic lights, jams, bridges). Turn out all the lights in a stadium, enter all cameras, steal money and information from anyone. Its like an in the future GTA and its incredible. There is even psychedelic drugs mini games were your in a neon alternate world jumping on pink flowers. Its briming with content that even reminds me a bit of Saints Row with that zany mission i just mentioned. This is the future of next gen.",05-30-2014

I like the bonus games within the environment. My only complaint is the game seems to loose its appeal after a straight hour of play. It seems like your doing the same thing over and over.

My favorite game of all time is Skyrim, even though I didn't think I would like it I was amazed at the vast open world and options to construct your own adventure. I expected this game to be similar as far as how you go about the story. I was wrong, but it is a great game. Very entertaining and there is loads of stuff to accomplish which keeps you busy. Each mission or event may make it feel as though you have completed it before.",05-30-2014

GTA4 was a bore to me, over production, horrible accents, too chore based; take Susie on a date, Susie forgot her purse at the restaurant, go out on a second date with Susie, mow your lawn, wash your car, tuck in your shirt, ENOUGH !  I sold GTA4 in a few days.

I expected the same here, even after I watched the live streams, this game doesn't look that great on stream, but the hacking, ominous way of the game still called to me. I cancelled my $54 preorder like a fool after watching the early pre release vids, couldn't stand the hype machine it called me back, I bought it for $65, flipping love it.

It's raw, it's more real than GTA4, it's subtle, it's ominous, the music is excellent, the instrumental drama comes on in a intense moments.  My second day playing was way better than my first day I'm more powerful, have more skills, know more of what I'm doing now.

Only knocks I could give would be car chases, it's hard for me to evade the cops on some portions of the map, cuz some are tighter than others.  I wish I could customize my character a little more, I'm not a hat guy.  I'm so weird there, I  wish I could at least put a ""fitted"" on Aiden.  They show small tutorials, but it would have be nice to have a small intro level that walked you thru the game more, but I'm less experienced with these open world games so maybe that's just me.  I just don't know exactly what I'm doing, I'm only 5% thru and my buddy already finished it, but he didn't do any side stuff, took him two days, hard to believe especially since I do a ton of story and my progression says 5%.  Again I'm not experienced with these open world games, slower, more cautious.

Anyway to the pessimist guy, which is definitely me, might be you, have no worries about this game, get this game.  Also don't know what people are talking about, graphics look really good, graphics 8/10, game is a 9/10 at least; the 82 Metacritic score to me is too low.

Note: I have not played the multiplayer, and haven't accepted any hackers request.  Don't use my advice on multiplayer I'm afraid to play it yet, cuz I'm just learning the game, but looks fun on stream, PS4 live feed.

Funny story:  I think a online hacker can steal your data even if you don't accept a hackers challenge, or maybe I hit accept by accident anyway I was on a CTOS tower freeing the map (like Far Cry 3's radio towers) I was up high and it said an online hacker is downloading your data.  I felt I didn't have time to hack the area, felt exposed, quickly tiered down the CTOS tower, jumped in the fastest car I could find close and took off out of the area, immediately saw a girl running, ran her over, and it was the hacker, dead in 30 seconds after I saw the download, how cool, and funny, and lucky is that ?!

Remember no games coming out unless you are a UFC fan until last week of April, which is Madden, second week of September, which is Destiny, too long to wait.

I endorse Knack, Killzone, NBA2K14, Resogun, Watchdogs, all excellent..  COD Ghost is good, but frustrates me, not magical like MW, MW2, full of speed merchants.  I didn't play Battlefield..",05-30-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,I had my doubts,"I really debated whether or not I should pre-order this game. There was a lot of concern about the fact that Ubisoft made game reviewers hold their reviews until release day. There was also rumor that Ubisoft was paying reviewers for favorable reviews. To be sure, I had reservations about Watch Dogs.

With so little to play on PS4 though I figured I'd take my chances. I'm glad I did.

Watch Dogs is tremendously entertaining. I love that you can tackle each encounter from multiple perspectives. You can run in guns blazing, and you'll probably do alright. Or you can use your hacking skills, and bounce from camera to camera, luring your victims (with car alarms, monitors, signs, forklifts) to a place in which you dispatch them with explosive environment pieces.

In one encounter I waited outside of a parking garage, hacked into a camera on the second floor. I spotted a car with a car alarm I could trigger, so I set it off. Three guards approached it. They looked at it, made comment about the buggy city, and then walked directly next to an electrical transformer on the wall that I hacked to blow. Three dead. No shot fired.

If I have a single complaint about this game it is that the driving doesn't feel good. I'm not a driving game fan, so I couldn't tell you if the cars are too 'floaty' or 'drifty' or if the steering is 'too loose' or 'too tight'. But I can tell you that if you get to a decent speed, that the stopping distance is tremendously long to the point of you almost need the handbrake for every turn. Since you spend a good most of your time on foot though, this isn't particularly problematic. At least while free-roaming. Some of those police chases are harrowing if only due to the fact that I drive like an alcoholic, in game; weaving everywhere just trying to stay on the road.

All things considered, it's still early in my game but I don't regret my purchase at all. I am really enjoying Watch Dogs and there's a good chance that you will too.

If you had your doubts due to Ubisoft's handling of reviews, fear not. Read a few of the reviews out now, and sprinkle them with your own discretion. I love the game. I can't wait to have more than an hour to play it.",05-30-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,great buy,The game is nice there is some draw backs but nothing to hold u from buying the game give it a 4 out 5,05-30-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,"Not the Best in Graphics, but Compelling","I have been looking forward to Watch Dogs for about a year now, and it's one of the reasons I wanted a next gen system to play at the best it could be (Amazon first posted Watch Dogs ONLY available for the PS4, it ultimately turned out to be a multi-platform game). However after a few hours of gameplay I realized this is not the Next-Gen game we expected and while it is a huge game and at times can be fun, I find it tedious and repetitive. It is very much like the gameplay style of a Grand Theft Auto game, which is good, however we've all been there done that many times in the past.

Last week I purchased Wolfenstein: The New Order and I have not been able to put it down. I am almost done with it and once I'm done I will play it again. It is fast paced, has action, violence and simply is a lot of FUN to play. Watch Dogs, while involving and vastly surpasses the complexity of Wolfenstein or other FPS, it simply is not fun. A game, should be fun, that's why we play it.

Watch Dogs is a close copy of a GTA game. It has the same basic idea and playability, however it has a touch of modern technology and hacking abilities. Don't get me wrong, Watch Dogs is a good game, however I feel like I've played it before in some capacity before. Watch Dogs graphics are good for an open world game, however if it was exclusively on the PS4 it would look like Infamous or even better! They were going more for style and atmosphere, which they pulled off fairly well.

+ Decent Graphics, good lighting effects and coloring.
+ Complicated and thought provoking gameplay.
+ Huge City! Good atmosphere and environment. A lot of time and effort went into the surroundings.
+ Hacking is a technique which can become entertaining once you get a handle on it. A lot to see and do, and depending on how you play, this game can be very time consuming.

- Control isn't the best, reminds me of Alan Wake, which was a great game bogged down by horrible controls. Very sluggish and slow-responsive.
- Not as fun as a game should be, almost seems more like work to play instead of a release of stress from the real world.
- Driving is boring, hard to control and frustrating at times when you must keep up with someone you're chasing.

Over-all it is worth a purchase and a play through, however when I am completely through the game I may sell it or push it to the side for a year or so. When I get off work and want to relax and play a game, I'll be grabbing something like Infamous or Wolfenstein before I reach for Watch Dogs. It is a grand game, however it did not meet my expectations of over-all gameplay and fun. If you are a fan of the GTA games you will love this as it is very similar, however you must be patient and take your time with your playing style, as just shooting people may not be your best option.

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,Tempered expectations create a wonderful gaming experience,"Let me start off by saying that I am writing this review from the perspective of someone that has not played any of the GTA games since the PS2 days.  Regardless, the entire concept of Watchdogs is what's most impressive.  The game is almost a social commentary on consumer privacy laws/protection/censorship that have taken center stage as of late.  Politics aside, this is truly one of those games where you find yourself immersed in the subject matter.  The beauty of the game are in it's endless options of manipulating anything around you that has the ability to be hacked, from a simple traffic light to being able to black out certain sections of the city.  All of this power (pun intended) right in the palm of your hand.  Taking down bad guys has never been so fun without ever having to lift a finger or pull a trigger on a weapon, which let's be honest, is a refreshing thing in an era where games like Call of Duty and Battlefield own the landscape.  Some may scoff at this, for good reason, but I think it's a breath of fresh air.  There is a little bit of everything for everybody in Watchdogs, I encourage you to experience it for yourself.",05-30-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Mind Blowing Concepts,"Watch Dawgs, aka Loading Dogs, plays as cinematic gaming experience... except for the awkward initial install (PSN DL). They start you out in a loadium where it's the bottom of the eighth. You've found the shooter and click. ""Damn it. Gimme my bullets Jordi."" ""Can't. Threw them away."" Run! Run! You're hackin', you're shootin' stuff! Then blam. Loading~86% (sunuvagun shoots right up like an iPhone battery then takes forever to finish). Leave your PS4 running... you've been warned.

But back to the cinema, the opening's beautiful. The digital cloud conceptualized. Data flows everywhere we go and Watch Dogs expresses that in their art. Which... peeps into our lives very deeply. You know that super server in Utah? You know, the one~you guessed it! That the NSA built? Yup, that's the one I'm talking about. Watch Dogs be watching the feds, because Ubisoft's put a miniature version of those computers all over Chicago (yes, the Chi-town-graphics are great... we will see better in the future though) and use it all over the god dang city. Biometric scanning. Security feeds. Hacking-ception.

Ubisoft crafted the 'masterpiece' series Assassino! Watch Dogs challenges the concepts that AC first presented to us with... moar Templars (the NSA). You're the lulzy group DedSec that challenges this global conspiracy. You shoot someone, a person will call the police. Then the cameras start automatically scanning the area for your face. Data taken in from these cameras are pretty much 3D (like the body scans at the airport, but more detailed).

Watching it all put together by Ubisoft Montreal excites me as a gamer. If you care about gaming, then support new intellectual properties. Don't buy used: Watch Game Stop crash and burn for committing the sin of ""buying back"" $60/like-new games for $5. Either way, get your hands on this game. If you've spent $XXX on a console, then you might as hit up Redbox for some DVDs/Blu-Rays/Games.

It's a new generation. Finally video games can be considered part of mainstream, along with movies.

Edit:

Some more examples of CTOS (cough, Kinect) scanning technologies I've seen in Watch Dawgs:

Trash scanning. Yes, f-ing trash scanning. As some of you may know, (public) trash is considered ""open property,"" meaning it has no 4th Amendment protections. So, in Watch Dawgs they installed cameras inside the trash cans to scan for drug/cash/etc. drop offs/exchanges. Some guy dropped a sack of drugs in the trash can, they scanned it, and blam, drug deal busted. How's that for a mind blowing concept?

Here another mind blowing concept: plant pattern scanning. A Chicago citizen was cultivating my state's legal herb. The camera scanned the pot leaf's outline and matched it to the illegal substance Cannabis Sativa. Feds Watchin'",05-30-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,"Great Intentions, But Is Rough Around The Edges (7 of 10 on point system)","To me, this is a perfect example of what the last generation saw with the rise of Assassins Creed. Assassins Creed started out the exact same way; the game was fun, was new, exciting, and different, yet quite flawed, but you couldn't be all that made when it messed up, for it nails the main aspects it strove for to be different from all else quite well. Assassins Creed pushed free running, an interesting storyline, and a time period and location that had not been explored previously. However, Assassins Creed also failed in many ways, such as many times getting stuck when free running, poor mission designs, not much beyond the main mission structure, and a lead that isn't entirely likable (Ezio was a much more likable character, as well as more interesting, leading to his string of three games).

Watch Dogs has the same general trend that Assassins Creed endured; the first had great ideas, but needed a sequel to take the mistakes that were made prior to make a game that was even greater than before, and one that is up there with my games of the generation (made me love the series). Watch Dogs has great intentions, and excels extremely well as what it promised most. However, Watch Dogs made mistakes along the way, neglecting major aspects to any open world game, as well as following AC's mistakes in some ways as well.

Lets get the bad out of the way now so I can leave this review on a good note. The graphics in this game, to me, were not as great as I had expected. True, the game looks nice, but there is a large difference between how this game was suppose to look when E3 occured a couple years ago in the first demo and how the game looks now. I usually am not that bugged by the graphics, however, so this was not a huge issue to me, but it was something that I had noticed when I started playing. The character models look great for the most part, and the details are there when they want to be, but when in open-roaming and not in cut scenes there is not much detail like the demo had (AC 4, to me, looked a little bit better).

On to my main gripes (the former being very minor, and really it is a wash because the night time is actually great looking versus the day, which is interesting). Lets start with vehicles and driving. Each vehicle behaves, essentially, the same way. Almost every car, from a super car to a sedan to a van to a SUV, all behave, sound, and are almost all the same save for different building models to make each car at least look a little different. Each car almost peals out immediately when trying to use the gas, almost acting as if the car can go 0-60 in a second and a half no matter what the car is. This can be annoying, for it is not really that realistic. And like much of what the internet has said, the driving itself is not good, to be blunt. Now, I am a fan of many racing franchises and I enjoy many different kind of open worlds games, so to be an open world game needs to make an enjoyable transport system. Watch Dogs did that with on-foot movement, however the driving can be irritating and takes quite a lot of time to get use to. I hate to make the comparison, but GTA is the marque series for open world games like this, and they each have (mostly) nailed the driving experience. GTA 5's driving was not perfect, sure, but the driving was not terrible (took time to adjust to, just like GTA 4's). But both of these made enjoyable experiences from driving; car chases, races, ect., and the driving was fun to do. It was much like how Red Dead Redemption nailed the horse back riding experience, and thus made the transport system much better for it and made riding around fun (even though the world was empty in many areas. Another example would be how AC 4 nailed ships and sailing. With all that said, Watch Dogs failed at the driving experience. I tend to avoid it if I can personally. The cars are cumbersome, the handling is extremely awful, the brakes act almost like the handbrake, all the cars feel and behave the same, the physics are subpar, with all this leading to a maddening situation since driving is such a major means for transport in any open world sandbox in the present or during the period of mass produced cars.

The AI in this game beyond the enemies are also a sour note. The AI in the NPCs, people who just wander and walk around, are just empty shells that are just there, for the player to do with as they please. The problem is, what if you are trying to be a good person? Trying to avoid hitting pedestrians when driving around a corner during a chase? Good luck with that. With the driving being terrible, things were not looking up. But the AI in the NPCs are pretty bad, with their reactions not being what you would expect nor would want to expect. I have had many pedestrians jump out in front of my car in fear because of a car chase, instead of trying to avoid the cars and get out of the way like normal people. I have had pedestrians walk in my line of fire during an assault of a convoy instead of running for the hills. This point might be nit picky, sure, but it is something I noticed, and something that did take away from my experience a bit.

Lastly, the characters. Personally, I found Aiden unlikable, meanwhile enjoying the story, character development, and what have you of the secondary characters and minor characters versus the lead. Aiden is just a blank slate, much like Altair from AC 1. Thankfully, the characters beyond Aiden are actually fun, interesting, and really push the story versus Aiden.

Now, onto the positives!

Sure, the driving sucks, but beyond that the game actually plays pretty smooth once the controls get mastered. Each gun feels unique, different, and realistic (almost feels like the designers put more time into the guns and clothes versus the cars). Firefights are interesting, fun, and can be chaotic when trying to get an advantage in the fight. The hacking works extremely well, and is both fun to play around with and steal money from people, and is also a tool to cause death and mayhem upon foes, and is something that I am looking forward to evolving and becoming even better. The side missions in the game are also quite awesome, varied, fun, and can be quite challenging, which really makes the player need to make good decisions for fear of death in a few bullets. And the online is very fun, chaotic, and terrifying at times as well, but there were many problems I ran into in terms of matchmaking and playing online at times (not very frequent, but I did run into it at times).

But really, what is most important in a game is the fun factor, and the fun is there. Sure, the game has problems, and sure they can sometimes cause irritation and anger and frustration. However, the game is still fun; the story is interesting, the characters are mostly fun, the gameplay is quite solid mostly, and the online components are very fun if not problematic at times. I enjoy this game mostly, but this is also a game that is not a must have in my opinion.

I do recommend playing this game to experience it yourself, however, and to make your own opinion like I did. Hope the read was helpful and leave comments if you have questions, qualms, or just want to talk about any sort of topic!",05-29-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,It's good.,"This is a lovely new game.  When Ubisoft devotes themselves to a project, they do big things.  I'm playing the game in spanish - I love the language options and learning language while i play a fun game.  I wanted to speak to the ""lack of personality"" of the main character.  I read an ign review (i think) that said the main character was a little dull and boring.  I agree, yes he is, and he is also a wild cowboy vigilante murderer.  Who wants a charming healthy nathan drake persona when you can have a dry, shows-little-emotion tough blue collar personality?  And specifically with this main character, it is clear to me (even though i'm far from finishing the game) that Ubi designed Aiden Pierce to be urban-cowboy-esque.  The most obvious giveaway is that his default costume is a cowboy duster.  He wears a hat like a cowboy, but the city version of a cowboy hat - the hat is cheap and gimmicky beyond the shady ""hiding"" vibe, so I decided they chose this to be his urban cowboy hat.  If you play the game yourself, and you have any familiarity with some good western movies, you will notice that Ubis main character Aiden is very specific to what they wanted, and it's all meant to be disarming and go down easy, similar to the western movie approach - you don't panic when john wayne, charles bronson, or clint eastwood, cowboy-clad, guns somebody down, and for the same reason, you won't panic playing aiden pierce and accidentally hitting a pedestrian while driving.  It's all very realistic, but still theatrical.  The way Rockstar tried to make that same difference possible in GTA5 was to make the main characters already kinda insane and street-thugish from the start.  I think I much prefer the approach of Ubisoft here, more subtle.",05-29-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,"Worth the purchase for its hack effects alone, I think...","...but not as strong as other sandbox games.

While Watch_Dogs manages to deliver its progression and area missions better than Assassin's Creed 1-3 and has better tricks and gimmicks than GTAV, its story and replayablity suffer in comparison to both series.

Set in a near future Chicago where the populace is helped/hindered by an omnipresent Big Brother situation and only hackers, vigilantes, and criminals seem to be doing anything about it, Watch_Dogs runs the standard David v Goliath plot line with story missions that are a bit light on the drama but often serve to introduce you to open world mechanics.

Take, for instance, an early mission I tried to start for Jeordi (who is a nifty sendup to Oldboy's Dae-Su in design) where, instead, an outside player hacked me right as I was about to get going. The mission I was going to do was put on hold so the game could fluidly introduce me to the online component, leading me directly to the scripted intro area and having me briefly wait for a real life opponent to try and steal my data. After that, invasions can happen just about any time you earn a bounty by hacking a Blume NPC (the evil corp of the game) or invites can come that you can acknowledge. Either way, just the sheer ease of being INTRODUCED to online play this way was terrific.

A lot of the game's novelty comes from the hack mechanics that Aiden can perform (and unlock through skill trees).

I've spent hours already just wandering Chicago, people watching. While the majority of info you can glean concerning professions and lifestyles are mundane, a good ten to fifteen percent of the secrets you can learn from your average pedestrian are hilarious and fun. It's also one of the ways I chose whose bank accounts I would hack. For instance... if the Profiler data on someone told me they had been diagnosed with lymphoma, I won't hack them... end of story. But, if say, they had child pr0n on their servers, their bank account (or the paltry amount you can actually take from them) was mine.

Unfortunately, the fun hacks can wear a bit thin when you get into areas that don't have many hackable devices. Raising bridges and blowing steampipes are great in certain zones for curtailing police pursuit, but get into the suburbs where you mostly have only the occasional streetlights and barely any traffic at 3AM, and you're sunk. There are other mechanics (like a button press to turn off your car and hide unless cops are in close proximity), but there's a learning curve. Heck, I'm still trying to master my timing when it comes to Blockers.

I think I should also mention the tablet app minigame that allows friends to set up adversarial races from the comfort of their iOS or Android tablets. It's kind of a one-trick pony where you're trying to outrace whatever cops and obstacles they can put in your way, but it's a nifty cross-platform bit of connectivity and made for plenty of fun moments for both me and my best friend sitting beside me tapping away as his tablet furiously sending vehicles my way or setting up gas mains to blow.

Overall, I am very satisfied with Watch_Dogs and am no doubt going to get dozens, if not hundreds, of hours of fun out of it. Maybe that's the glow of freshness making me feel a bit generous, as there are a few notable flaws, but I'm enjoying the heck out of myself right now and think it's worth the money.

So far this game is really fun and addictive.  I was a little annoyed with the fact that you can't just punch people in the face and things like that.  It doesn't really make sense that you can't get in fights with people on the street.  I quickly got past that because of the various fun things to do while walking around.  I have only done a couple pieces of the campaign so far because I keep getting distracted by everything.

Many people have complained about the driving.  I think that the driving is a little hard, but definitely doesn't keep me from enjoying the game.  I have actually gotten used to it and if you figure it out, it really isn't that difficult to control.  Most of the fun things to do are done on foot anyway.

Hacking is fun and I keep stumbling upon random crimes and crazy stuff by listening in and reading people's text messages.  There are a lot of situations where you are able to create your own strategy, and this is a lot of fun.

It's hard to go into all the random things you can do, but this game is definitely worth 60 bucks.  If you have any specific questions about the game, feel free to ask.

Overall:  In the future I would like to see even more interaction with the city.  I would like to be able to go into even more buildings, be able to sit down, talk to people, and just interact with more objects everywhere.  This is a great start though, and I feel like it is well worth the price tag and I will be getting a lot of play time out of it.  This game is pushing things in the right direction.",05-29-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,"Looking to the Future, Stuck in the Past","As a critic, divorcing a product from the hype surrounding said product is exceedingly difficult, especially when it comes to video games. Giant publishers hype up their games to ridiculous amounts, rewarding preorders with extra content in order to generate more publicity, making grandiose claims about the features of their game, and showing off beautiful footage that isn't indicative of the final product. Some may argue, of course, that a game should be respected and admired for its own qualities, and not the qualities initially promised by the promotional materials. While I'm liable to agree, I feel that if a publisher promises certain things with their big titles, there's a certain obligation to deliver those things to the audience who is going to gamble sixty dollars (more if they purchase expensive collector's editions) to get a taste of those promised features. If the game is released and doesn't deliver the things promised, it should get called out for it, as publisher hubris in this industry needs to be kept in check.

That's why ""Watch Dogs"" is, for all intents and purposes, a middle-of-the-road affair in my book. It shows initial promise, but the more one plays, the more one begins to feel like they are playing the same game they were six years ago when ""Grand Theft Auto IV"" hit the scene, albeit stripped of some integral features and with some neat twists thrown on top of it. This is not a revolutionary game by any stretch of the imagination, and reminds me of a time when the market was positively flooded with games attempting to ape Rockstar's success. The problem, then, is that several other open-world games have come along since then and improved the formula in drastic ways, making this game's fight an uphill battle as it tries and only partially succeeds to distinguish itself from the rest of the pack.

The story doesn't do this struggle for identity any favors, as it is one of the most by-the-numbers and generic plots out there. It follows Aiden Pearce, who is a stereotypical stoic white dude out for revenge for his murdered niece. He's shunned by his sister for his efforts to protect herself and her son, but the game makes it pretty clear that we're supposed to support his endeavors and not question them too much. Even when, y'know, he associates with people who break into apartments and tie up the occupants just to use their living space as a temporary base, or feels no qualms about stealing invading people's personal privacy yet lectures other people about the evils of doing the exact same thing. Allegedly, the game is about finding out who ordered the hit on your family, and getting even with old allies who are now enemies, yet it meanders so much and changes in tone so often that it's hard to keep track of what you're doing, why you're doing it, and why you should even care.

Further compounding this narrative problem is the extraordinarily boring cast. Aiden is essentially an unmasked Batman with less combat prowess and more gruff angst that's hard to really care much about. Clara is a walking, talking ripoff of Lisbeth Salander from ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,"" but stripped of any personality beyond ""punk rocker wet dream."" The rest of the cast, what little there is, consists of unremarkable stereotypes and archetypes that don't do much to elevate the narrative beyond the uneven revenge yarn. And while it might not be the ""cool"" thing to talk about in a game review, I really hate the portrayal of black characters in this game, as they tend to be portrayed as thugs who speak in painfully stereotyped slang, a problem that spreads even to the NPCs. It's 2014, and such a lack of diversity in a cast feels dated at this point. Overall, this is a story that lacks consistency, bite, and a diverse cast of characters for people to connect to, and is downright embarrassing when looking at its contemporaries.

Saving the day, then, is the gameplay, in some respects anyway. Sadly, the missions are mostly the same old song and dance we've seen in sandbox games time and time again. The first few hours of the game feel fresh and fun, sure, with a small arsenal of hacking tools at your disposal and a big world to explore. As things wear on after that, though, there starts to be a familiar feeling that's hard to shake. That is to say, the missions start slowly deteriorating into ""chase this guy,"" ""kill this guy,"" ""tail this guy,"" or ""take out this base,"" the same generic guff we've been slogging through since the earliest of GTA clones. This is hurt by a patently annoying checkpoint system that feels particularly unforgivable considering what else is available on the marketplace today. There were points where I actually uttered, ""I don't care,"" to myself repeatedly, then quit the game for a while to go play something else. The missions are generic, and generally speaking, there's very little proper explanation as to why you're doing them.

Fortunately, the game is actually fun to control, and certain missions can be played differently depending on how you want to approach them. You can stealth through an enemy compound, killing no one and getting the information you need, then getting out. Or you can hack cameras, blow up steam valves, and take control of machinery to take out whole squads from afar. Of course, you can also just run in guns blazing and kill everything in sight. In more than a few missions, it's entirely up to you how you play the game, which is always a big plus in my book. That's why it hurts when the game forces obligatory shootouts or stealth sections, as it feels incredibly out of place with the rest of the game. While the controls are generally solid, especially the excellent driving mechanics, I can't help but feel gypped at not having more options when it comes to tackling them.

The central gimmick, which is hacking, is a bit of mixed bag. While it's fun to raise bridges for quick getaways and to blow up grenades in enemy's pockets, these features are incredibly limited and generally useless when it comes to most missions. Yeah, you can make some cars chasing you crash, or take out two enemies sometimes with a well-timed explosion, but that doesn't mean more cars won't randomly appear beside you, or that you won't have to finish up that fight with an assault rifle. It doesn't help that the rest of the hacking is relegated to minigames that feel like a low-rent mixture of the hacking mechanics from ""Deus Ex: Human Revolution"" and ""Bioshock."" For a game based around hacking, there's a real lack of substantial usage of that feature, and for the most part, it feels ancillary.

""Watch Dogs"" has gameplay that works, but that's just it. It only works. It doesn't do anything special, or bring many new things outside of hacking to the table. It simply works, which is more than I can say for a lot of games, but a far cry from innovative. Also, it should be noted that the shooting mechanics are really barebones and obnoxious. Aiming your weapon feels sluggish and lacks any sort of real weight. Furthermore, there are no options for blindfiring or shooting from the hip, or drive-by shooting for that matter, which is pretty inexcusable for a game made in 2014 with an emphasis on cover-based shooting. So, yes, this gameplay works, but only just.

This whole review sounds like I'm ragging on ""Watch Dogs,"" and in some aspects, I really am. For something is purporting to be the next big thing, it sure feels like a lot of other ""big things"" that have been executed in a far superior fashion. Yet this isn't to say that Ubisoft's GTA-like is bad. There's a lot of fun to be had here if the flaws can be overlooked, thanks to a large, varied world and some really great vehicle controls, not to mention a healthy amount of side-activities and some decent multiplayer. And the story, for all of its tropes and lame characterization, is made entertaining by snappy dialogue, pretty cinematics and a frankly amazing original score that helps offset the embarrassingly paltry soundtrack. As far as GTA clones go, this is one of the least offensive ones, and while it doesn't approach the heights set by competitors, it's still a good deal of fun. Unoriginal fun, sure, but fun nonetheless. It's a polished, slick game that sets out what it's trying to accomplish. Problem is, what it's trying to accomplish has been done before and done better.

So, to the chagrin of eager GameStop employees who have tried to convince me that this will be the be all, end-all ""next gen"" game, I have to say ""Watch Dogs"" is pretty ordinary by most accounts. I've played this game when it was called ""Grand Theft Auto,"" ""Saints Row,"" and ""Sleeping Dogs,"" and I enjoyed it those times, because each entry offered something different and unique. But what ""Watch_Dogs"" brings to the table isn't very special, in my opinion. It makes up for this lack of originality with a wealth of content, though, and a world that feels very much alive and populated, especially with the funny NPC dialogue and ability to read anybody's identity at any time. Maybe the graphics aren't the best, and maybe the gameplay is derivative, but at least ""Watch Dogs"" is a fun, inoffensive game with plenty to do that should tide you over until some of the bigger releases of the year hit in the coming months.

If your the type of person on the pc hacking into programs and such like me, this is a defendant must buy.
Hack the city in the palm of your hand.

A lot of similarities of GTA but better graphics & quality. Get to do a lot more stuff than what you could do in GTA.
Besides the fact this game makes GTA look bad plus with a twist.

Reminds me a lot of Infamous Second Son. But here your a hacker going after a guy that put a hit on you that killed your niece.
In Infamous Second Son, you go after the bitch that hurts your tribe to gain her powers by killing her or expose her after what she did to Reggie & the Tribe, what she is really doing by keeping her kind safe in cages, either that or they probably would've killed her.
In a way its like Dumbledore treating Harry like a pet up to the proper point to die when Snape is the good guy the whole time in secrecy that cared about Harry since he was born since he cared so much to Lillian.

Driving 9/10
Really like the driving in this game except for some of the hard turns you gotta pull off by pressing circle but to me its easy, just got to time it when to do it and how much, to much or to less with to early or to late will impact your speed and get away.

Wreckage 6/10
While driving, getting into a mess by damaging the car should have a little more realistic type of damage depending what car you use and what you hit impacts to the car. Besides the fact you are the hacker and you have better driving skills but doesn't include what car you drive thou.

-Havent bought my own car since gianing a lot of cash, at 5mill now, I wonder if we could upgrade our parts too to make it a bad ass with some paint spray, fast speeds after take off from 0 with less amount of friction. if so, tats a straight 10/10. if not but somewhat to it, then i give it about a 7-8/10

-Do love the add-ons by upgrading the wheels but that can be different from car to car that you don't own plus without going to a shop with it so that's a disadvantaged in it as well.

Graphics 8/10
are astounding but could be better with along of 4k-8k, hopefully there be an update for it plus the visual effects to it.

Police 8/10
Can be hard at first comparing to from playing gta for 1st timers of watchdogs but after getting used to what to do on how to get away comes easier.

NPC 8/10
Really realistic, just a little more it be really great.

If you don't wanna get it now, get it later in about 2-3 months from now, a lot of games from PS4's to XBOXONE's are coming cheaper, not as cheaper than Xboxone thou. Go look at the prices between xboxone, ps4 to xbox360 to ps3 new games and used games. get more money through ps4 than xboxone. ghost xboxone used is est. $10 while ps4 is est. $20",05-29-2014

There are a lot of things that could use a lot more polishing like driving, but if some areas are suffering because they focused all their efforts in creating this experience then I'm ok with it.

There is so much to do in this game and the gameplay and mechanics are so fun that I don't care if the lighting is flat sometimes or if the car physics are a little off. The truth is Watch Dogs is a new IP and it delivers a next gen experience if you can realize that next gen is not all about the graphics.

Infamous Second Son is still by far the most beautiful game I've seen on any Next Gen (current gen) console, but you still do basically the same things you did on Infamous 1. Watch Dogs on the other hand delivers a new gameplay both on single player and online multiplayer that is nothing I've experienced before. From hacking into cameras to tailing people online or playing on your phone against people playing the game, Watch Dogs is an exciting new IP that takes advantage of what this new generation brings to the table.

I can't wait for Watch Dogs 2.",05-29-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Great game,"I've played the game between 6 and 8 hours, and I'm really enjoying it. Some people would say it's like Grand Theft Auto (GTA) but more hacking centric. And it kinda is. There's car jacking, hiding from cops, chase chases, and stealing.  But, unlike GTA, there's a big puzzle/problem solving aspect to the game.  For example, there's one mission that require you to find a person with security clearance, and use that clearance to get into the servers.  You can do it the old fashion way and run in there with a machine gun, kill everyone, take the clearance, and hack the server....then outrun the cops.  OR you can use you surroundings, such as security cameras, forklifts, car alarms, etc.., to distract the security team so you can hack the person's clearance and gain access without even setting foot in the compound.  The former way is much fast, but risky.  The latter require lots of time but safer.

If you must compare it to the latest GTA, GTA5, then I think this game is way better.  Immediately, the dialogue, the voice acting, and the character development is better. I found GTA 5 dialogue weak and pointless/senseless, the characters are annoying and whiney.

After all that time invested in the game, I'm still only on the 5th mission of the first act. There are so many side missions/tasks you can partake in. Stopping crime, playing weird VR side games, gambling, hacking people's phone, checking into places to gain mayorship (yes, just like in foursquare), or just driving around Chicago for fun.

There is one thing I found to be annoying. Because you can hack/see everyone's phone on the screen, sometimes pointing you cursor to the desired target becomes a task as you will need to move around or get closer, but this sometimes alert the target.  There's nothing wrong with the design, it's just sometimes, there are way too much activity on the screen as once and it's tough to get to the target you want.

Overall, it's a great game. Worth a try even if you don't normally play this type of game.",05-29-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Outstanding Game,"This game exceeded my expectations.  Boring?  Hardly.  There are hundreds of side missions, items to collect, people to hack.

One of the first missions is to enter a building full of armed guards in order to hack into a computer system.  My first try was to shoot my way to my destination.  Big mistake.  A traditional stealth approach also failed.  After studying the hacking option in and around the building, I learned where the game truly shines.  Hacking.  I was able to complete my object without firing one shot.

Hack a camera.  From the first camera I hacked the next camera, etc, etc.  From the camera view I was able to hack various devices, machinery, and other items.  Hacking a crane allowed me to release its payload on two guards.  Very cool.  Other hacks allowed me to disable half of the guards before I entered the compound.  Take downs were used to disable the remaining guards.

Hacking is a blast...much more fun then shooting your foes.

I feel like the free roam trailers were a bit to rehearsed, the actual amount of flexibility in missions is very little. Now the problem is that most people compare this to gta 5. Its not as free as gta, more on rails. But its still a good game, its a bit like scarface the game as far as the feel. The game is just a bit off but maybe im still not used to it. Overall its pretty fun, great time killer, but am i going to play this obsessively for the next month? Probably not. Still worth the money.",05-28-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,2,"Just as the 3 star rating states the game so far is ""just okay"" that lag tho...","The game is NOT BAD However the game is no essentially good either. I don't know what it is about it but the game just seems a little ""off.""  Everything in the game is smooth except for the driving, which makes the cars feel like weighed tanks except when you go around a corner and spin out of control.  Theirs a decent amount of cars/bikes/boats in the game.  Story is good  Ton's of stuff to do.

Ubisoft severs are either always down or no one is in multiplayer because the game can never find other players.  Would be fun if Ubisoft worked on it a little.

Finally I noticed multiple times lag within gameplay.  When you finish a mission and you start to run or drive the game lags.  When your in the cut scenes and a character grabs an arm of another the hand goes right through the arm.  This is what I am irritated the most with. Ubisoft delayed the game to polish it, which is absolutely fine but if you delayed a game for this long please make sure simply lags and cut scenes are on point.  I will get use to the horrible driving but that lag needs to be fixed.

UPDATE:

So after playing some more, I noticed that the game is completely laggy and is full of glitches.  I was standing right by enemies and they didn't advanced because of the ""glitch"" that must have been going on.  I noticed this with each activity, side quest, etc.  I already mentioned this but I still don't understand why Ubisoft delayed the game to polish it yet theres still a lot of errors/bugs/glitches that need to be worked out.  I understand no game is perfect.  This is a same to i normally really enjoy Ubisoft games. For this reason I am giving it a 2 star review.",05-28-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Great game and premise with only minor bugs chipping off the shine,"Watch Dogs is what you get when you combine GTA open-world style violence and gameplay with The Matrix, and is probably the only game where your character spends more time standing on a corner staring at a smartphone screen than driving or shooting.

The story is well put together and introduced in near psychedelic style dreams and flashbacks, and follows a master hacker trying to track down his families murderers after a massive hacking score.

Gameplay is tight, and is a combination of Assassins creed parkour, splinter cell style distraction mechanics and close combat, and GTA third person shooting. Driving is the only part thats not well handled, as breathing on my PS4 controller causes even my beat up van to go to maximum acceleration, and the roads are apparently always wet as even a gentle turn can cause you to slide out.

Side missions make this worthwhile, and you can spend an hour oing nothing but wandering around playing with the profiler app and collecting bank account data. Some of the click points are frustrating, as you might hack the wrong person or alert the wrong target, but theres such a wealth of side and back story that its contantly an adventure. Hacking will be your bread and butter obviously, but its just so much simple fun that even the nerdy ARG games they loaded in are worth dumping a few hours on.

Audio is top notch, though the propensity to make your hero constantly sound like he's gargling marbles is getting out of hand. The graphics are simply sublime. While they couldn't do the whole loop to exacting scale, I could easily recognize certain streets and buildings and the feeling of scale and distance were nearly perfect. The only fault I've found is some of the smash cuts during the hacking between cameras can be almost nauseating on a large high end screen, and you can easily get turned around.

Theres only a handful of nits. The cops are nigh unstoppable Terminator like automata, and I died about 4 times on the opening mission doing nothing but trying to escape a police search zone and running headlong into a roadblock that you always cant see until its too late. Driving is too hocky pucky most of the time, and the amount of time you have to intervene in certain crime side missions is way too short.

Overall, this is great. Tight storyline, entertaining gameplay, gorgeous audio and graphics, and engaging characters. Literally the only reasons its not 5 stars is the difficulty of evading police in even low level pursuits, the handling of vehicles, and the graphical overlay during some of the hacknig mechanics. A definite buy and a 4.5 stars edging so close to 5.

Update: After some more play I ahd to bump this up to 5 stars. There's some more mechanics of combat that I hadnt really uncovered, and they add not only a layer of realism but also keep the game from being near impossible. It takes a moment for a enemy to spot you, and doing so doesnt mean they instantly alert every other guard. You're still limited to mostly luring and dropping enemies one at a time, but just because you're a master hacker doesnt mean you're Batman.",05-28-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,"Fantastic game with one big flaw, or: How not to do driving in a video game","I haven't finished the game yet, but so far it's proving itself to be every bit as fun and engrossing as I'd hoped it would be ever since they unveiled it two years ago. This game's take on Chicago is up there with the last two GTAs' doppelgangers of NYC and Los Angeles. The city is usually teeming with life and things to do. I'm finding it quite difficult to make progress through the story line, because there is a constant stream of side activities popping up at all times, and generally speaking it's all fun. There was a lot of fear that this game would be a ""typical Ubisoft game"" i.e. the same handful of mini-missions and mini-games being repeated over and over and over. To some degree that's true, but there's a lot more than a handful so it takes a very long time for any sense of repetition to set in. Personally I'm not interested in the ""multiplayer"" aspect of other players randomly invading my game to ""hack"" me, but it's only happened a few times and I don't mind it so much. I believe the more you opt to invade other players' games, the more often you will be selected to be a target for other players. I think I've gotten myself on the ""no fly"" list.

I was disappointed last March when the ""Story Trailer"" was released and made it very clear that the game wouldn't be living up to the graphical splendor of the first demo footage shown at E3 2012. I'm happy to find that the finished product comes reasonably close. Digital Foundry's analysis has shown that, at least for now, the PS4 version is superior to the PC version in some ways, which is incredibly surprising. That's very good to know as someone who basically had to turn in their ""PC gamer"" membership card years ago (the last time I upgraded my machine was to get ready for Doom 3 and Half Life 2, yipes.) This game generally looks great. I haven't seen anything as wonky as was indicated by the trailer in March.

Now that the game is out, it's no secret that a lot of people think the driving is terrible. I tried to be optimistic about it- one of the biggest and most common complaints about GTA 4 was its ""horrible driving,"" which I eventually found to be the most sublime driving in any video game in history (including GTA 5)- but no, unfortunately the driving in Watch Dogs is just plain bad. Sloppy. Stiff and unresponsive. Worse than the driving in any Saints Row or Sleeping Dogs. It only took me a couple of hours to go from ""My god, this is virtually unplayable"" to ""Eh, I can work with this I suppose,"" and I'm sure I'll be pretty comfortable with it by the time I finish the game. The development team leader has said publicly something like ""We worked very hard on the driving, we took all of the time and effort necessary to make it as good as it could be. We think we really nailed it."" Puh-lease. Ubisoft, you really need to do your homework for the inevitable sequel... which I'm sure is already in development. Back to the drawing board, s'il vous plait.

EDIT a few days later: Another note on the driving issue- As you progress through the game, you gradually gain access to more and more cars. There's a wide variety in how they handle, with the sports and ""performance"" cars naturally being better than the others. Paired with getting better with practice, the lousy driving does become a bit of a non-issue after a while. Still would like to see a lot of improvement in future WD games. What I really came to appreciate in this game is the stealth and combat. Top shelf stuff.",05-28-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,Eccentric Next Gen Game,"One word keeps running through my mind playing this game and that is Eccentric. So we're perfectly clear this means: ""irregular; erratic; peculiar; odd."" This doesn't mean the game isn't fun. It doesn't mean that it doesn't bring some new and interesting things to the gaming world. But it does it in such an odd way, and combines such disparate game features and design that I cannot help but feel that despite some visionary game play design, they tried to do too much and totally lost focus in the process.
Personal preference will dictate if you find these oddities annoying, fun, or not even noticeable.

When considering buying this: does consistency and/or details matter to you? The unique game play, hacking focus, great graphics, and general novelty keep it interesting, but it is utterly lacking the cohesive structure and design that marks the difference between good games and great games.

Strange Morality:
The main character can hack into people's phones to listen to their conversations - their personalities and discussions are wide ranging, funny, strange, and serious, which gives some needed reality and meaning to the game world. Between spying on citizens, you can hack their accounts and steal money - higher earners are better targets but you can still hack laundry store owners and sign holders. So now that you're done spying on these people, stealing their money, manipulating the city infrastructure causing deadly accidents and explosions, you turn into a vigilante, and set out on missions to save individuals from harm. A minor case of psychosis perhaps?

Vehicles - you're so special, they turn special when you get in
Vehicles have decent though very race car simulation like driving. There are several different views, including interior with steering wheel which is rather fun and a nice change from say GTA series where you do not get this perspective. Vehicle damage is extensive and accurate, and they explode rather easily in accidents. They can also be magically and immediately delivered around the block with a phone call.
Whatever vehicle you happen to be in turns into a monster-car wrecking-ball. You can easily push under and through other vehicles that are stopped or driving against you, and your car suffers far less damage than anything else on the road. The screen shakes and rumbles as you press the accelerator from a dead stop. Any car, reverse or forward, it's a jarring and strange mechanic.

Side games and activities:
Take a break from exploding city infrastructure - water pipes, explosive grates, gates, and bridges and play some chess games in a caffe.

Feel insane yet? Take a nap and get into a demonic car mini game where an unknown speaker alternately taunts and congratulates you for running people over. It's not just a simple game, there are skill trees, progression, and leader boards to check! A couple other games of a similar trippy nature await.

Buy one of two outfits in numerous different color styles. The clothing material/textures are visually stunning. Too bad you're a weirdo who wears the same outfit every day of your life, regardless of the occasion.

Constantly interrupted with side missions, you either mark the waypoint or wait a while for your screen to de-clutter. Screen space is in short supply in this game, and is used to terrible effect.

Absurdities of the game world:
The world is deeply detailed with a massive amount of breakable objects. Trash cans go flying, fences smash apart, and telephone poles are knocked down, and shatter, as most large logs do, into numerous pieces when driven through.

They call Chicago the windy city, perhaps that's why the trees are in an massive epileptic fit, constantly, regardless of the slow moving dust particles and leaves lazily floating through the air to showing off next-gen graphics. Your character's face mask is to protect from massive dust particles, not to conceal identity.

Boats in the water have no wake - perhaps they hacked that basic and obvious aspect of water travel it into oblivion.

Music is controlled through an app on your phone - it's not very clear how to set it up and seems to constantly reset. Also, you have to hack the songs from people, so getting the playlist you want may be difficult. Keeping that playlist playing seems just as difficult.

Online Always
The final piece is the online always, even in single player feature. A wonderful advancement in the gaming industry that should really be supported by buying any game that ensures constant server connectivity for the game experience.
Thankfully, the game tells you, in a huge message box on your screen (that cannot be acknowledged and closed) when you have lost contact with Ubisoft. The game reconnects in the background, doesn't tell you when it has done so, and then drops you again. Expect to see the loss of server connection window a lot! Thankfully it lasts quite a while, so you can definitely read the lengthy message. You'll probably have time to read this review in the time that window takes to go away and let you play the game with your full screen space again.",05-28-2014

It looks stunning and it plays very smooth. my only complain is the driving seems a little hard to maneuver but maybe is my sensitivity on the control.,05-28-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,Watchdogs Review.,"First while it will be compared to GTA it is not. They are similar only because they are open world, and anytime someone has a sandbox game they want to to do these comparisions.

Now while this game isn't groundbreaking, it does take concepts from other games and meshes them quite well. Seriously, this game should be looked at as an open world stealth game. You can approach the game guns blazing, but it will not be forgiving. I find myself not trying to rush through missions. It makes it real enjoyable looking for ways beat a mission while shooting as little a possible.

Visually the game looks great, when it first began and transitioned from the cut scene to gameplay I actually didn't know for a second.

Controls are good, however they do take a bit of getting used to. I suggest before doing any real missions, stay in your hideout and get used to the controls. People will call the police if you have the gun out too long. This is especially true for driving. Driving will take a bit to get used to. Some people have complained about it, but I think it brings balance. You can hack the freakin city, it would be pretty cheap if you could handle a car with nascar precision. After a bit of driving around the city driving won't be that bad.

Where this game excels is the AI. I'm playing on normal and am suprised at how smart they are. If you start messing with too much stuff them jokers will be on alert.

Content: There is so much to do its insane. I am really amazed. Unless you are the type to want to hurry up and beat the story, you will find yourself lost in the city just doing random stuff. Heck I'll sit for about 20 minutes hacking peoples bank accounts and just reading the info about folks.

My biggest gripe so far is the time it is taking to find online hacking sessions. But when you do find them or someone finds you, it brings another added element to this game that is very, very interesting. Another gripe I have are the mission failures because you kill someone. I would rather them do something else like mess up your rep. Some of those takedown missions are no joke.

As long as they keep content updated, this game should do well for quite a while. I give this a 8.5 out of 10.

----------------------------------------------------------------Slight Update 29 May 2014-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok. Real quick follow up on watchdogs. I have honestly never played a game to where I didn't even care about doing the main part of the story. Last night while hacking a few ctos bldgs, I went from Sam Fisher (splinter cell) to Rambo. The more and more I play I find this aspect to be the best part. This is the first console game that they actually followed through on letting you approach each objective differently. Heck you can even change tactics mid objective, unless you went in guns blazin to start.

If you don't have this game I would most def say get it. It is jammed packed with things to do.",05-28-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,I guess it's fun...,"As there are many reviews ahead of mine, I'll write this review from the point of view of a casual gamer who does not live and die by press conferences and video game websites. The game is enormous and I'm sure there are many side games that I haven't even begun to touch; this really is just about first impressions.

First of all the mutch hyped graphics/resolution...whatever. The game looks good. I find the A+ titles on PS3 and X360 titles to be very close to PS4 graphics. Infamous SS looked better in my opinion, but both are still very good. BF4's single player smokes this, but it has a lot less going on, so maybe not apples to apples. I certainly wouldn't purchase a PS4 for the visuals in Watch Dogs, but it still looks very good, espcially for a an open world game. I would say it seems to my eyes, very similiar to Assassin's Creed on PS4.

WD is also very playable. The controls in these games are getting to be consistantly smooth. Again, like Infamous, you typically aren't fighting the controls to make the cars, character or guns do what you would like. I still struggle in Assassin's Creed with random wall jumping or character steering issues. The cover mechanic and gunplay seems very polished and there doesn't seem to be any inout lag. I prefer the weighted cars to twitchy cars in GTA, a plus in my book. Overall, very fun to control.

The story is where this game, and many other open world games lose me. Our guy is not likeable. Aiden is souless and boring bent on revenge. Perhaps stealing money that didn't belong to you would have been a better route and not cost you your niece. Virutally every character I've encountered so far is also a villian. Very limited redeeming qualities. I'm just not a huge fan of anti hero stories anymore. I still think there is some merit to a principled character fighting for his values...but I digress.

Ultimately WD does cool things with the hacking. Fans of open world games should find a lot to do with minigames that range from chess to poker to mechanical spider terrorizing, racing or whatever. If you were expecting this to be the first big next-gen title to really blow your mind...well prepare for some dissapointment. Watch Dogs is fun of not revolutionary.",05-28-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Hated it at first then learned to appreciate it.,"I am a casual gamer and bought this game due to the lack of games on the PS4.  I played about 4 hours last night, and I was rather disappointed and ready to sell the game today.

First, this is definitely not a GTA type game which really ruined it for me.  Yes there are side missions, but it's a really not as fun.  When there is a crime in progress, you follow the arrows to the area.  Sneak around to profile the people in the area, but if the criminal spots you, the crime doesn't get committed and you just spent 10 minutes for nothing.  What a waste of time!

Poor soundtrack, I had to turn the music off every time I am in a car because the music sucks in my opinion.  Instead of having multiple genres, you're stuck listening to whatever is on and the only option is to skip or stop.  I chose STOP!

Driving.  My goodness I spent about an hour just to do one fixer job. The driving mechanics are really hard as I crash and hit every single thing in front of me trying to escape the police.  I hid in a secluded area, but the cops still hover around the area.  Then when you do evade them, you have a certain amount of time to get to the drop zone.  Frustrations!

 Story line is weak as I had no clue what the main point was in just the first few missions.  Niece was killed?

Yes it was fun to profile people, hack trains to stop/go, car alarms, traffic lights, vending machines, etc.. however after a couple hours, this got extremely boring and repetitive.

Bottom line, the driving aspects of this game to elude the cops was so frustrating that I had to turn off the game.

EDIT:  So two weeks later, and I absolutely am addicted and LOVE this game.

1. I am now pretty good at driving after learning you can't just hold down the accelerator all the way and expect to have full control of your vehicle. Different vehicles perform differently.  The way you can easily order a car to be dropped off is a blessing!

2. The story line could be better but for the most part it's a great story.

3.  Learning to use your hacks greatly helps in missions.

4.  The conversations these NPCs have is ridiculously funny and intriguing.

5. Graphics look great.  Seeing a car burning, explosions, rain, buildings.  WOW. So many times I just walk down the block and marvel at how life like everything is.

Probably the only downside is the lack of music selection.

Overall the game is awesome and I take back everything I said previously.",05-28-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,"""One Sentence Review"" Of Watchdogs","I've spent some time with Watch Dogs, completed several missions and roamed the city, dipped my toes in Watch Dogs pool.  I feel that I've experienced enough to give an honest one sentence review.

One Sentence Review:
Terrible car handling and overall driving experience mixed with unimpressive ""last-gen"" graphics, nearly crumbles what is otherwise a smart stealth and techno driven dystopian revenge tale.

-1 star for the abhorrent driving and graphical inconsistencies.",05-28-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Open-world urban action game for those tired of Grand Theft Auto.,"Does it look as good as the 2012 E3 reveal? No.

Is it a revolution in the game industry? No.

Does it have enough new features to keep you interested after the ceaseless tirade of open-world games? Yes.

Watch Dogs is a bit of a dichotomy as it seems like they were going for a very near-future take on urban crime and hacking with a dark tone and a hint of cyberpunk themes. This is evident in the aesthetic, the mood at times, the music, and in a few of the missions. It feels incredible in its shining moments where you're chasing down a criminal on foot in the rainy streets of Chicago by nightfall, only to pull out your gun and take a few shots, hurdle over a fence, then trigger a transformer to blow remotely with your cellphone.

In moments like these I feel like the game has a feel unique to its own and is incredibly satisfying to play. Unfortunately it seems like some executives got the memo on how immensely popular (and lucrative) Grand Theft Auto V was and you can see the GTA influence creep up in the free roam gameplay (outside of main missions). This I feel is the weakest part of the game, and although you still have your hacker tricks and cellphone profiling intact, it feels like an imitation rather than an innovation.

I for one, having played Grand Theft Auto games since the 90s have grown tired of their formula of sandbox drive-and-shoot gameplay in a lifeless closed-door city. Watch Dogs threatens to change all of that with randomly-generated personalities and background details in Chicago's denizens. Sometimes with superficial details like ""Has an expired gym membership"", to more pertinent details like ""Painkiller addict"". Follow that suspicious person around and he might try to mug or attack someone, giving way to a confrontation or chase. This sort of techno-vigilante feel is amazing, and it's too bad the tropes of the genre seem to water it down. Perhaps the hacker aesthetic is dulled when you're simply walking the streets in daylight and nothing is happening, nevertheless there is fun to be had here - in many, many places, missions and collectibles.

The online play is equally exciting, with the 1 vs. 1 hide-and-seek hacker encounters stealing the show. At almost any time you may be invaded by another player trying to tail you or hack your phone for data/reputation. If you're the victim, you have to scan the crowds and utilize cameras and other methods to spot the intruder. If you're the attacker, you have to blend in, sticking to the shadows or being inconspicuous while the timer ticks to completion. These can be intense moments and when you spot your man and take him down or get away with your digital heist, it can be incredibly rewarding.

Overall, I am slightly disappointed with the final direction of on the game, but after a two-year wait and delays, graphical downgrades and bad press, I have to say: This is a good game and with a unique playstyle that is enough to keep even an oversaturated open-world game player like me interested.",05-28-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Worth the wait.  Will blow your mind,"I don't know where to begin with talking about all of the good things about this game.  It's extremely fun and realistic.  Probably my favorite part so far(I'm only about an hour into it)is all of the hacking you can do.  Basically anything that is electronic can be hacked.  The first mission requires you hack through cameras to cause a blackout.  After completing this part, I also noticed that you can listen to some people's phone conversations is interesting and some of them can be very disturbing.  The driving is fun but I haven't gotten used to the controls yet.  I heard this is a very long game, so I am sure I have a LONG ways to go at the time of writing this review.",05-28-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,If only hacking were really this easy.,"It's a leap into the 21st century for open-world games.  I spent about six hours with this game so far, and I have to say, I am hooked.  I work in IT, so the fact that this game is built around hacking was something I found interesting.  Everyone and everything connecting to ctOS is a potential target, even city infrastructure!  Manipulating city infrastructure already came in handy for me on several occasions.  If only it were that easy, though.  Anyway, I love open-world games.  I don't like being pigeonholed into one specific path to follow in a game.  WATCH_DOGS lets you do what you want, when you want, without being overwhelming.  There are some limits, though, like character progression, and there aren't ctOS connections in every district immediately.  You can't put all your ""level-up points"" into one branch or hack civilians bank accounts in every district right off the bat.  Progressing campaign unlocks new things.

I find the game to be fun so far.  I am not a ""hardcore"" gamer, but I do like to play them pretty much daily if time allows.  Games are meant to be entertaining; therefore, I base my ratings of a game on one factor - is it fun to play?  The answer in this case is yes, WATCH_DOGS is fun and very entertaining.  For example, on missions you can either go in guns blazing and kill everything in sight, or you can be crafty and hack security cameras, distract enemies, and even kill them by sabotaging the environment while staying hidden to accomplish the objective (all with your smartphone to boot).  Considering that good Samaritans have the ability to call 911, the second option is usually wiser, as I've found it fairly difficult to evade the police at this point.  The 5-0 come out of the woodwork in full force, and they are pretty smart for AI by cutting off exits and surrounding you.  However, there are some ways to stop them from calling 911.  There are apps for that smartphone - like the Jam Coms app - and, of course, you could always do it the old fashioned way and rip that phone out of their hands, too.

Perhaps my review would be longer if I had spent more time with the game (I've only just unlocked the ctOs connection for The Loop, and I've yet to try it online).  I may update the review in the future if it's relevant and not buried.",05-28-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,4,"Engaging, Unique, and I will be Playing a LOT More","The premise of Watch Dogs is simple: vengeance. You are an elite hacker who reached out too far one day and paid a hefty price. Now you are out to find those who wronged you. Along the way you have at your arsenal a cell phone that gives you a one-button ability to access a database of information about the NPCs in the game, as well as standard RPG/sandbox fare of a gun and other items.

Music & Sound

The soundtrack for this game is varied, both in terms of musical styles and subtlety. What gives Watch Dogs its strength is using the environment as its soundboard. That is not to say that you do not hear music at all, rather you experience it in a vibrant world in a manner that a person normally would; walking past bars or in cars, for example. The sound effects are where the subtlety comes in.  From the footsteps across gravel and the radios of the police, to Aiden Pierce's labored breathing and heartbeats when he is wounded, everything fits together to create the vibrant city that is Chicago.

Graphics

I won't say too much here, but the game has a gritty feel to it. I don't know too much about Chicago, so I cannot compare map-to-map, but the detailing in the city and the nooks & crannies really give you a lot of places to run and explore.  In short, the game is beautiful and has a lot of amazing scenery.

Gameplay

In your quest to find out who wronged you, you earn experience and skill points that can be used to gain access to new abilities and to expand upon existing ones. In many ways, it felt like ""Last of Us"" when it came to picking up items like ""electronics pieces"" and ""unstable chemical""; both of which (as I am sure that you can surmise) can potentially be used for nefarious and/or distraction purposes). Also like ""LoU"" you will be spending a lot of time sneaking around, but where ""LoU"" leaves you at the mercy of the movements of the bad guys, Watch Dogs gives you a fun toy in your ""hacker/cell phone"".

Are you running from the police and need a quick distraction? Pull out your cell phone and hone in on that stoplight. Hold down a button for a moment, and suddenly the light changes from red to green, and there is an accident, slowing the cops down and buying you time. If you are a bit more evil, your phone will pick up on shorts in transistors: you can blow them up, but you could risk killing someone, and that will keep the heat on you. And just like in other games like ""GTA"", if your Heat level is too high, you will find yourself locked out of the game's All-Knowing version of HAL, ctOS, and suddenly information about NPCs... your fellow citizens, will be cut off to you. All that you will be able to do is minor chaos.

So sure, you can run around and drive like an idiot (boy does handling ANY vehicle suck, even with some skill points added), but you will pay for your chaos by losing some of your access at first. As the story progresses and you become more powerful and gain access to more useful ""hacker"" abilities, you will become more resourceful for those times when you can't get to ctOS, but losing ctOS truly leaves you feeling lost...

Controls

If there is anything about this game that left me a bit frustrated, it was the controls. While you use the right analog stick to alternate between hacking targets, it isn't a ""snap to"" situation. In many ways this function acts like a mouse, creating an annoying little cursor that you having to move around to find a ""hack spot"", like when you are learning to use a distraction device. A second complaint involves the lack of a pure ""jump"" button, rather than having to get close to something and hope that you can jump on it. Oh, and if you hit the wrong button when you are sneaking around, you'd better pray that you don't reveal yourself. An early example is in the stadium; I was trying to get past the guard and was sneaking from cover-to-cover (""X"") button. I got to the end and rather than having a nice, easy way to jump up to the goal I had to move around until I got the prompt (""O"" button) saying that I could jump there. Way to handhold us kiddies, Ubisoft.

In The End

With the frustrations with the controls aside, Watch Dogs is a fun title that has some nice abilities for the player to use in an urban environment that has consequences. With a smattering of GTA, a bit of Last of Us, some Metal Gear Solid for posterity, and a with healthy dose of its own originality, Watch Dogs brings a lot to the table and doesn't disappoint.

This is a unique title that has a lot of different playing styles thrown in. There are objectives that you must accomplish as you play Aiden Pierce, but as long as the heat (read: police) isn't onto you, there is a beautifully detailed city that you can explore. Do you want to hack random people and steal their money? Or will you have some morals and leave the targets alone? It really is up to you, and those decisions will affect your ""Notoriety"" later on. All-in-all I have found myself drawn into the story of Mr. Pierce, enjoying the difficulty curve and exploring Chicago while experimenting with the ""powers"" that he has, and I cannot wait to see more.",05-28-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Next gen,"I hate when people say "" i hate when this game is compared to gta5 "".. ofcourse it's going to be compared even though its different games. Now on to the comparison first off let me say i'm not a huge fan of GTA cause i think it had uninteresting characters and game EASILY made me lost interest, and like 10 more flaws which i won't waste time with but what i can tell you is watch dogs is the complete opposite.

This games characters so far are actually interesting and im invested in the story and i also care about what happens to aiden and i wanna know what happens every next mission like it's fun and interesting. Unlike Gta where you do stupid yoga missions with michaels wife or play as trevor who's a idiot imo. Sorry for the hate towards gta5 but this game is just 50x better. I'm also saying all this because i READ SO MANY COMMENTS ""gta5 is better not buying"" like really?

Now the game isn't perfect ill say the plusses but first let me point out a minor flaw and that is the driving which isn't as bad as other people say but like it feels naturally wierd. The control of it a little hard and that isn't a bad thing but physics of cars is kind of like.. hard to explain i guess but don't expect it to be super realistic.

The good:

+Graphics look completly next gen and beautiful even on ps4's resolution 900p
+The crowd in the game is so realistic and real, city feels full alive (good example is when u hack street lights and cause accidents) like it's so realistic and its not copy paste stuff
+you randomly see ambulances and firetrucks and police cars, crowd reacts to all in a realistic way
+The story is interesting and keeps you engaged and there's so many hours you will spend without getting bored
+The game favors some puzzling/thinking instead of the usual run n gun WHICH I LOVE (thank god they didn't favor cod audience and make this game mindless run n gun)
+You can hack so many things which i won't list but you unlock more as you go and i love the skill point system
+The soundtrack is 10/10 (so far) it's perfect for the situations im in
+Stealth is biggest plus imo, you have to really think your every move
+Gameplay is great i don't have any complaints, but the controls you will need to get use to
+huge map (i don't see why people say game is small?)

Overall great game and highly recommended seeing as besides destiny theres nothing out on ps4 till like october i would not wait on this and just get it.

Edit: Oh man i have to edit and say this games city feels SO ALIVE i really cannot put it into words. IT'S FULL ALIVE. You will see people jogging sneezing coughing and doing phone conversations and you barely see same person twice. There's no load lag where see you people randomly appear and disappear. The reactions they give and the natural feel of them not being robotic and not just walking straight like every other game. There's people sitting in restaurant tables outdoors, sitting in grass, playing guitars, running, arguing after a accident traffic light hack, standing together and pointing at stuff. Like seriously gone are the days of robots just appearing and walking straight. I've never experienced a games city be more alive. It's way too realistic",05-28-2014

The driving isn't great at first but you will get use to it after a well.",05-28-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,3,Not quite the leap we were looking for but still not a bad game either,"Lets come right out of the gate and say it. If you have never been a fan of GTA, or open world sandbox gaming, then this may not be the game for you. To be brutally honest, I almost feel like the extra months needed to polish this game was also used to give enough breathing time between the latest GTA V and this game but this is just my opinion. So, on to the bigger question, was Watch Dogs worth the wait? You get a resounding maybe.

Story:  The story itself is pretty much a very bland revenge story of Aiden Pierce who is looking for the people responsible for the death of his niece after a hacking heist gone wrong. He has a broken relationship with his sister and his nephew that he is trying to fix but of course its finding a balance between doing whats right vs whats necessary in order fix that relationship that comes into question. But doing so means that Aiden has to dip into his bag of hacker tricks to find the people responsible and that means hacking into Chicagos top notch OS system to get what he wants.

Gameplay: This is where things tend to get a bit sticky. It is very hard not to compare this game to the GTA series but you almost have to in order to see the difference and similarities of the two. The biggest difference of course is while this game has its own moral compass that players will have to hurdle, its not as seedy as GTA in the sheer and raw crimes against humanity that you can commitbut you can still commit some seriously raw crime on here. Of course most of that comes through the hacking opportunities that Aiden can do throughout the game. To a degree, you have almost too much freedom to hack because at any given moment you can listen in on any conversation, hack any gate and steal as much money as possible in a short amount of time and this is even before you really open up a lot of the skill trees that you are given. One thing that GTA was at least good for is that it slowly gave you items to work toward where Watch Dogs almost forces it down your throat and its easy to get distracted with side jobs which are more than plentiful and sometimes proves to be too much of a distraction. The one big plus that I did like was your approach to missions and this is where this game shines and thus differentiates itself from GTA. It makes you remember that first and foremost that Aiden is not a gun blazing thug. Many missions can be completed with zero to a minimal amount of lives lost if you know how to use the CCTV system to hack your way into vital systems in the game. You can do things such as shut down gates, cause plates to explode, open doors when needed and so on. Occasionally some objectives will eventually have you manually go in to open certain systems but the element of stealth sometimes works better than a straight shootout. This gives the game a flexibility that isn't often seen in the GTA series but reflects more in Ubisofts other franchise Assassins Creed.

Some of the quirks in the gameplay: As with all open world games there are bound to be some issues and Watch Dogs is no exception. While the hacking and side mission options are too plentiful at times there are other things that can be brought up.

-  Car radio: other games have had this issue solved right out of the gate but for some reason, Ubisoft didn't bother to differentiate on music genre when driving in the game. All the music is lumped together and you just have to right click through until you get to the song that you want. Its annoying as hell so usually I turn the music off.

-  Voice acting: one of the few games you can hear anything from a surfer boy accent as well as a faux Irish accent in the same game and most of them are not done well.

-  Consistent radiant AI: This one is actually a good and bad thing and one I hope gets fixed in future games on these new platforms. I do like the fact that in some cases NPCs will take it upon themselves to call the cops when they see you draw a weapon or steal a vehicle but the issue is its not consistent throughout the game. I would like to see at times when an accident is caused or sheer amounts of mayhem is happening, that the cops are called as well.

-  Access: While you can theoretically open up large sections of the game early on, unless you have certain skills, you can access some buildings right away and some you cant. This gets confusing at times because I feel like some places you shouldnt have access to so early on and others you should but some reason, you just do.

-  Cover system: Its a bit clunky at times especially during shootouts. Its easy to get stuck in the wrong place because its times like these is when the controller gets a bit unresponsive when you need to get out of cover

-  Weapons: I alluded to how some items are forced down the moment you start playing. One of the biggest imbalances in this game is that if you hack long enough and it doesnt take long, you can have all the guns you need and never have to worry about buying a better one or running out of ammo so while for some, its one less worry, for others, it takes away the challenge and the feelings of being mortal because you never have to worry about not finding crucial items when needed because its one hack away.

Graphics:  So the question on everybodys mind is, how does it look on next gen systems? I have it on the PS4 and while I can say that it looks good, Infamous looks better. I am also still looking at the fact that this game was supposed to have been a launch title. There are things that graphically the game does well such as lighting and particle effects even some of the water effects are done well, but its still not quite screaming next gen as of yet. More of this is seen when you see some of the other character models that are around the main character and they low-res in comparison.

Sound: One thing about games like these is that the sound is important. From the rumblings of the trains to the voices broadcasting the news to the public, Watch Dogs sound stage does indeed shine but its not hard to do on most games like these.

Overall: Watch Dogs is a game you would like if you want a slightly different pace from the GTA series. Its not as ratchet or depressingly violent as GTA can be although the elements are in place for it. It is the big game that we have hoped and dreamed for? No, not quite but there is promise for this new IP that Ubisoft has put out. Its interesting to a point but not quite as fresh as many of us were hoping. To be honest, this may be the game that has many of us questioning do we have to many open world games just like we have too many FPSes and would this be the game that makes creators reconsider their approach to sandbox gaming. Some games don't give enough and some too much. Watch Dogs gives just a bit much but some of it is just enough to keep players around to get through the campaign with more than enough distractions to keep one busy long after its completed.",05-28-2014

First off this is hardly ""Chicago"". Im from Chicago and that was a huge selling point for me. I thought how cool to be able roam Chicago in a game. Its not Chicago. There are a few landmarks like Sears Tower , Water Tower , Hancock Building and the parking garages by House of Blues are all featured but nothing around them is remotely like Chicago. Its an open world environment similar to a GTA game. You use a smart phone to hack into different things. Graphics are good but im still on the fence . Instead of shooting being the focus using your hacking abilities is the focus. Not sure what else to include in my review. The whole Chicago thing really disappointed me. So maybe its a 4 star game but I feel deceived so 3 stars.",05-27-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,Watch Dogs PS4 First Impressions,"So I wasn't supposed to get this game until like 8 o'clock tonight, but it got to my house at 12:30! 2 hours before I had to go to work! So what did I do? I did what any normal person would do.. cram as much of the game into that 2 hours as possible :D That being said, I will be updating this review as I progress further into the game, this is really just a first impressions. As the title states. Without further ado, on to the meat!

Anyone who calls themselves a gamer has heard of Watch Dogs. Even if it's not your type of game, you've heard of it. And while I agree with the point that it wasn't as great as Ubisoft promised us, it's still an absolutely fantastic game that merits respect. It's not quite what I was expecting, but I am still very pleased with it and have loved every second I've played so far. I'll divide it up into sections of the game, and just kind of review the different parts.

Graphics: Oh, the graphics controversy. This has to be one of the biggest controversies in a game I've ever heard or witnessed. E3 2012... it was basically unreal. Then, as the years went by, the graphics degraded. How dare they feed us lies?! I'm ashamed to admit that it got into my head, and I started to doubt the game.. what if it didn't look that great? Only 30 frames a second at 900p? How could they give us such crap? Well, not to worry, from the first level that loaded up, the game looks gorgeous. Is it truly next gen looking? Well of course not, because it's cross gen. But it looks awesome.

Gameplay and Control: The controls are different from really any game that I have played before, but once you get used to them they really work. The biggest complaint I have seen so far with the game was the driving, which I can agree with, to a point. Driving is hard. My first time in the car and I ran over like 7 people while completely trashing the car. The hardest part is the turning, like the cars don't turn. At all. lol. But where driving is such an integral part of the game, if they made the driving super easy, then what's the point? Rather than it being a challenge, you're doing it just to do it. A lot of people have become lazy nowadays in that they play games just to play them, and not actually work for the end. Remember when we were little, and we had to play that one level over and over and over again to beat it, and once we did it was the greatest feeling in the world? That's kind of how driving feels to me. Yeah it's hard, but I don't think it was meant to be easy. Personally, I like the challenge it adds, so you can't just get in the car and all of a sudden be a master behind the wheel. And as for all of the people that are comparing this to GTA, stop. They're two completely different games that have some similarities.
  And of course, there's the hacking. I like the hacking because it adds puzzles to the game. It's not just a shoot 'em up, run and gun type of a game. You have to stop and think, and plan your escape route. I think it was beautifully executed.

Sound: So far I like the soundtrack. It plays music at appropriate times to get you pumped for whatever you're doing, and the radio in the car is really cool too. So far the voice acting has been top notch as well. That was the other big complaint I was hearing about the game, that the story didn't make any sense and that it was poorly written. I haven't made it far enough to confirm or deny that, but as of what has happened to far I've enjoyed it.

Multiplayer: I haven't had a chance to play the multiplayer, as Ubisoft's servers have been going crazy. But I will update this as soon as I get the chance to.

A lot of people compare the map to GTA five and say how small it is, but size isn't everything. It's smaller, but is in no way small by itself. And even though it is smaller, there is SOOOO much stuff to do. I'm not even kidding. The few hours I played I almost got overwhelmed with just all of the stuff that you could do, there's a ton. So don't think that just because the map is smaller than another game that it's small, or not good. It's a huge map, especially for all the content that's in it.

I think I covered all of the bases.. now for the things I don't like:
  - It does take forever to load into the game. Once you're in there are no loading screens at all, but when you first start the game up it probably takes between 20 and 30 seconds to load in. That's kind of annoying.
  - The destruction physics are good, but not amazing. Particularly if you get into a car fight and are crashing back and forth, the gouges and dents just kind of... appear. Like you'll get bashed on the car door a few times and nothing happens, and then a car will tap it and all of a sudden there's a huge dent in the door. It's like what? So I mean that's kind of obnoxious, but nothing I can't deal with.

That's all I can think of at the moment.. I'll definitely update the review the farther I progess in the game. Don't listen to all of the trolls and the GTA fanboys, this game is incredible, and easily worth $60.

**Edit**
  One other thing that I forgot to mention that I found incredible was the weather. Play this game in the middle of the night when it's raining, and it looks absolutely incredible. The night and day cycle is really well done, and one of my favorite things is the wind. Not only do clothes flap in the wind as you walk down the street, but I was walking and like a cup and pieces of paper were being blown across my path. How cool is that?! To see the cup go rolling down the street because of wind. Absolutely incredible. I thought it was awesome. :D

**Update 5/28**
  After spending some more time with the game last night, there were a few more things that I liked and didn't like. First off, I tried more multiplayer, and of the times that it worked I had a blast. I hacked a few people, and although it usually takes a while to get into someone else's game, once you do it's fun. I tried the multiplayer free roam, and although it has potential, it gets boring fast. All you can really do is run around, blow stuff up and get the cops to chase you. If they update it to where you can actually do missions and stuff, that would be amazing. So it has potential :) I couldn't load up into Data Decryption, Tailing, or Racing at all, and Hacking was really only like 20% of the time I tried that it worked. So once the servers aren't so flooded and they get more regulated, that will be better.

  Some of the things that I think really make this game awesome were the little things. When it rains, you can actually see the gutters fill up with water, or people will actually pull out umbrellas or shiver and hold their arms around themselves and try to warm themselves up. When it rains not only does your coat get wet, but your hair does too! Like that's awesome. I played a poker game and you can actually see the cards shuffle, and then the dealer throws out two to each guy and it's just cool to actually see him throw the cards out through the air. It's awesome to see all these little details to make the game so great.

**Update 5/30**
  So just a quick update, the online ques have gotten much better. Whatever your estimated time is, generally that's about how long you have to wait, 1 to 2 minutes depending on how many people are playing. I have been able to play all of the game modes, and they are all a blast. Especially Data Decryption and Hacking. Neither mode takes very long, but it just has that addictive quality that you want to go back and do it again and again. I find tailing really interesting. It's not exactly fun.. just because it's so easy. But what it does is really get you thinking: Anyone could be in your game at any time(Minus story missions, of course), watching you do anything. And you would have no idea. Like that completely blows my mind. It's crazy :)

  One thing that I hope that they fix is playing game modes with friends. Take Data Decryption for example. You can either join a public session, and get paired with random strangers, or do a private session. In the private session you need at least 3 people to start a match. What if just me and one other friend want to get in and play? You can't do that. That or I just don't know how. So that's something that I hope they fix, because the online is great and that would just make it even better.

  Oh, one more thing I've forgotten to add is the digital trips. Man, digital trips are just about the funnest thing to do in the world!! And I don't even know what makes them so fun. They're just little minigames, but they are extremely addicting. I've only played the infamous Spider Tank, and the one where Chicago turns to hell and I forgot what it's called.. but both are IMMENSELY fun, I really like that part of the game. It's also cool because when you wake up from the digital trip you'll be in a completely random place in Chicago. After the first one I woke up in somebody's pool :D I just think that's kind of cool.

**Update 6/12**
  I have finally (among a ton of the side content, holy crap there is so much to do) beaten the main story. I honestly don't understand what all of the gripe was about. I thought it was great. It wasn't absolutely incredible, it wasn't like The Last of Us level awesome, but it was pretty good. I even teared up at the end. For me it was a little slow moving until about halfway through, and after that it started picking up and I started getting really sucked into it. I thought it was awesome and I still stand by my review of this game, easily worth $60.
  One final word will be just some odd quirks I've found in the gameplay that were a minor annoyance:
  - When doing fixer contracts, which are basically timed races, you have to be at a complete stop to win, and your cars do not stop. Like holding both brakes, they don't stop forever. So that was annoying xD
  - The cops are relentless. They don't stop chasing you, and when they catch up to you, no matter what car you are in, their car will always be stronger, so they can sit there and run you off the road, no matter what. It's incredibly frustrating when you have like 3 of them chasing you and they can basically form an impenetrable wall that you can't get through.

I'm pretty sure that's everything.. It's a super solid game. I'm hoping that it's like Assassin's Creed 1 and 2, where 1 was good, but 2 just improved on absolutely everything and made for an amazing game. I still hold AC2 as my favorite out of all of them. But that's getting off topic. What are you still doing reading my review?! Go out and buy the game, ya bums ;)",05-27-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Watch-Dogs-PlayStation-4/dp/B00BI83EVU,6,Video Games,Watch Dogs - PlayStation 4,4,5,NOT just a GTA remix. (NO SPOILERS REVIEW),"I have played this game for a little over 2 hours so far. That being said I am not disappointed one bit. This game brings a lot of original content to the table. The hacking is really cool. When you are on a high speed chase with the cops or criminals you can use the street lights and tons of other street objects to stop your pursuers. The gun fights are much more smoother than GTA in my personal opinion. The story is more fascinating than any GTA game I have played(especially 5). The graphics are true next gen graphics. On top of that there is always something going on, Main story, Side quests, Mini Games, and the online content is vast as well. So if you are on the fence about getting this game, I would recommend doing so. The majority of the negative reviews on Amazon of this game seem to me are about people comparing the similarities to GTA. Its true, the driving sequence is similar and of course the free roam is in both games. However while free roaming in Watch Dogs, it is more than just going from point A to point B. My personal favorite is raiding Gang territory and taking down the required targets. Anyway, if you are not convinced from reading reviews, please go watch gameplay videos on YouTube. There are great videos that will give you a true idea of the Gameplay.",05-27-2014

First thing is first, Many people have very strong opinions on video games, not just this one. Reviews, comments, and statements about this game so far have been negative and harsh, but don't let that stop you from picking this game up! There are some aspects of this game that may let you down, but it is still a game I consider worth buying. A lot of people reviewing or commenting on this game are focusing on the bad aspects but there are tons of great things about this game!

- Driving-
By far the most complained about portion of this game. Physics are unreal, and driving is less enjoyable than expected. Nothing like our favorite open world game from Rockstar. There are a lot of cars in this game, (65 they say) but you might not want to be spending a ton of time in them. 7/10

-NPCs-
Great and rather realistic, a new bar has been set for conversations and actions of NPCs.
You can listen in on conversations and arguments that these characters have and it is rather believable. 9.5/10 (some physics make this not perfect)

-Graphics-
Looks very good, when it gets dark the city looks awesome. Walking looks smooth, running is a little weird, but nothing to get worked up over. Animations are fluid and for the most part natural. 8/10

-Overall-
Great game, lots of playability, side missions and extras all over. Graphics are good, but not the best we have seen from the ps4 so far. Biggest issue is driving. 9/10

In the end if you like the idea of playing a game where hacking is a big part of it, along with roaming a large city, and picking up plenty of side tasks get this game. There are a ton of negative reviews, but those will come with any game no matter how good.

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,5,The EYES Have It,"I can't get the name Eye Toy out of my head.  The familiar camera for the PS2 now has a very new and classy look on the PS3.  Say hello to the mature Playstation Eye.  If you had a Playstation Eye for the Playstation 2 you are probably aware of the interactivity that was available.  Now with the newest edition Eye that is taken up one level to a whole new dimension.

Getting my hands on this has been a few weeks in coming.  Deciding on whether I wanted to purchase it with a game is what kept me.  In reality I didn't need a card game so I purchased this for the measely sum of $40 and now I have this beautiful contraption.  Once you open the package there is not much to it.  Connect the 6 foot usb cord to the PS3 and go to device settings and make sure your PS3 is aware it has a camera.  No installation here which makes life that much easier.

If you have access to the Playstation Network you can download the Eye Create software for free.  A rather small and unassuming file packed with punch.  I really didn't expect much from a free program but I was in for a big surprise.  The program is actually an editing program and a very simple but very good one at that.  The program allows for capturing video, sound, and pics.  You can then edit your masterpiece to create a decent home movie.  I am still unaware as to whether I can upload the videos onto Youtube or mail them to others on my friend list.  This is a great little bonus program to owning the Eye.

As of now there are a couple mini games available at a low price on the PSN.  And of course they are interactive with the Eye.  The first game is actually an aquarium.  I don't know as much for a game as an interactive screen saver that would be nice when your entertaining.  The camera captures movement and gives your slight reflection as if looking into aquarium glass.  You can move your arms around to spook the fish and then you can act like your dropping your hand in the water to see the slight ripple.  Pretty cool little trick.

The other game is kind of silly but the kids will love it.  The object is to save these little mindless creatures.  By using your hands to move them to safety.  The game starts off rather easy and gets more complex.  Most adults may get bored but I can see how a child would have a lot of fun with the interaction.

Of course this is just the beginning of numerous interactive games that will be available for many months on the PSN.  No word as to whether they will offer these games in a collection on the disc.  The first major game to utilize the Eye will be Sing Star.  It will allow you to show off your singing skills to others.

Now I have just mentioned a few of the advantages of the Eye and of course there is the Eye of Judgement game many people have raved about.  But I enjoy this camera for the ability to have video chats.  I had a video chat and the picture looked great.  Very clear and able to handle low light.  What was also impressive was it moved at normal speed thanks to the cameras ability to move 120 frames per second.  Having a conversation with someone looks normal and not like they are moving in slow motion.  The microphone picks up sound extremely well and the voice conversation comes out great.  The PS3 allows for video confrencing with 4 people.  For the quality it is one of the best and cheapest video confrencing programs available.

I would have to say the Playstation Eye is a shining feature on the PS3.  If you are looking for something that will continue to reward you over the coming months with new games and the ability to actually see the people you talk to the Playstation Eye is where it's at.  Great for kids or adults it's a great value.",11-24-2007

The EyeToy comes bundled with the game, a deck of cards, a playing mat, a stand for the camera & a pack of booster cards, all for about $20 more than the EyeToy costs solo, sounds like a great deal to me, & you'll have something to play until all the other stuff gets released on the PSN !",11-12-2007

All the commands are being met and it is good quality. The reason I didn't give it 5 out of 5 is because, 1. The item came with nothing at all. No instructions (although it was simple to use) no installation discs. Nothing. 2. It came in a box that made the whole thing look used, as if I bought a second hand product. I have to say though, that this thing didn't look used. But the box it came it made the whole thing look used. and 3. It was advertised as being Sony, and it isn't.

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,4,The best price ever for a first-party accessory,"The best price ever for a first-party accessory. I don't use the camera function of this device much, but it's picture quality is not terrible: grainy, yet bright. Granted, my living room isn't the best lit, so while I say the camera picture is grainy, you could interpret that to mean that it's excellent in low-light environments. Like I said, though, I don't use the camera functions.
I bought this camera because I am sick and tired of wearing a bluetooth headset just to yell at foo's on the Internet. I solely use this camera for the microphone functions. I can speak, people can hear me, I can hear them (out of my TV speakers). There doesn't seem to be much feedback or echoing, but that will depend on how far away you are from the TV, the acoustic properties of the room you're in, and how far away your speakers are from the camera.
My only complaint has to lie with Sony, who, through a past firmware update, limited the microphone volume of their first-party devices (camera and bluetooth mic) to level 3 rather than the maximum level 5. They purportedly did this to cut down on the number of people who were simply too loud when playing their video games. This limitation is apparently not present on third-party devices.",08-06-2014

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,5,Works as its supposed to,"I bought this used. Here are my pros and cons.
Pros
1. It's cheap.
2. It works.
3. The cable is very long meaning I can put this anywhere.

Cons
1. None yet. Unless it breaks, it'll remain none.

I bought this for 2 things. As a PS-Eye but I also plan on using this for some 3D modeling applications. Should be fun and if you're going that route, it can't hurt to pick up one of these. It's like $15, what can you possibly lose? (aside from, yknow, $15 lol). Anyway. This worked as intended. Would recommend.",02-17-2014
https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,3,Ok,"I have the kinect and wondered how good this was so I purchased it with sports champions and one move controller. After many sessions to me it's almost the same as kinect they both aren't that accurate but it was an okay experience. My only complaint about this is the requirement of the silly looking move controller (love the light up colors!).

For some games you will find you need more than one move controller (like archery, volleyball, etc) it's optional but in the long run will benefit you better ($$$). It's simple to setup just plug in the usb to your PS3 and that's it no power cord/usb combo like kinect. In my opinion the catalog of games for playstation move is weak resistance, house of the dead, time crisis, little big planet franchise, and sports champions (1&2) stand out the most.

Seems like with most games like sports champion you don't really have to be as active like kinect. I guess that's a plus if you don't want to move around a lot? I feel this is where the accuracy gets hurt because in situations where you have to dodge or jump you don't really have to as you would with a kinect. Feels like a rip off but whatever.

In my opinion kinect is better no extra accessories are needed (playing a shooting game is understandable) but as I stated earlier even kinect is not that accurate either. Sadly the ps eye doesn't take commands like kinect that would of been nice addition but oh well. My final thought on this product is it's definitely not something you really really need but is okay to have personally I would play kinect more.",02-06-2014

The Playstation Eye is the ideal chatting device. It's a 2 in one device that is perfect if you plan to chat with someone. It's a Cam and a microphone at the same time. Because the cam is from Sony, it works perfectly with the PS3. The cam takes really good video as well as the microphone has pretty good sound and can pick up your voice very well, so long as you are in good range. Ever since the cam game out, there have been applications to let you video record, sound record, and take pictures for whatever the reason.

The graphics quality is significantly better than other webcams in the sub-twenty-dollar range (I've looked at many for a robotics project), and audio is also exceptional (the audio I had to confirm with a PC at work, as I'm not using that aspect with the Pi yet).

Note that this will not work with a Mac, at least without a fair bit of finagling. However, it works fine with the Pi. For the price, I really could not ask for more.

Also, if you're interested in Raspberry Pi video input, the OEM Raspberry Pi camera provides better video due to the built-in connector, but it is extremely delicate (I've already damaged one with a very minor drop - something I'd never have expected to cause a problem), and you're limited by the short ribbon cable (which can be extended but which is still not very flexible).

I can record a lift and then walk over and watch it immediately.  With kinovea you can watch in slow motion and draw on it.  You can also track your bar path.

The Move system seems to be more particular and sometimes harder to sync than the Wii we have used (thus, I believe an adult is often needed to set up the system for kids--I don't believe that is the case with the Wii).  We just got our Move system last week and already have ~5 games and are really enjoying it-- a very nice family option that gets you off the couch.  That being said, part of me thinks I should have just purchased a Wii (even though it doesn't have some of the Move features).",01-14-2012
https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,4,"A review from non-gamer, just video chat perspective","I got this so that we can use it for chatting with family. There is something about just firing up the TV and watching the family on the other side of the.... highway.

Quick summary: I don't think it is a good alternative to Skype.

Issues:

1. You have to turn on TV, PS3, if camera is not plugged in then plug it in.
2. Start the chat app.
3. If the party you want to chat is not available, then either call them or turn off everything. Or the worse, call them and they are busy.
4. Picture quality is ok. In dim light, it is very hard to see facial expressions.
5. Sound can lag or distort. Tested it with 6Mbps & 25Mbps. Both speeds have sound lag and sometimes distorted sound.
6. Cannot do anything else, like watching TV or movie... duh! Makes it awkward when there is nothing else to talk about. Cannot send links or photos.

Basically, I was thinking that it would be easier than using Skype on laptop.

I still gave it four stars b/c it seems very solid piece of hardware. I got Michael Jackson Move game and it seems to work very well. I suppose it works well for it's primary purposes which is gaming. Also it is pretty exciting to see your family on huge TV. Just needed right expectations to avoid any disappointments.",12-12-2011
https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,3,Where are the games?,"So I bought the Playstation Move assuming Sony was planning on releasing some games for it.  It's been quite awhile since any games have come out.  Seeing that the prices have dropped quite a bit over the past few months, maybe Sony is planning on getting the Move in more people's homes so that game maker's will actually want to make games for it.  As it is now, I wouldn't but it but if you do, there are two or three games that I'd highly recommend.

I had to call Playstation customer service and asked them to email me the instructions they also said that their items always come in official Playstation packaging no matter who they sell to. By buying this from Worldwide Distributors I did not get original packaging, instructions,and the manufacturers warranty which is typically 1 year which gives me peace of mine for 1 year. My advice to you is to make sure it's shipped and sold by  amazon if not get it from the store for around 3-4 dollars more u get the warranty, instructions and packaging which is a must for gifting.

Reasons for lower stars, It doesn't want to stay upright because the cord (the way the packaged it made it have lots of bends) keeps pulling it/weighing it down. The camera is so light it can't really hold itself up. Easily fixed by duct taping it to the surface.

Wait wait, with Sony eye you will go back to tradition :) where 3D and FHD or HD is not important, your going back to the 4:3 aspect ratio, and the lovely poor colors :)

I thought for the first time I've seen my self on this camera that I'm the hulk since I turned in green color thanks to Sony great Technology.

This camera has a good concept but:

1- image quality is SD don't expect anything, it has the DOOM resolution :)
2- colors are terrible, however you might enjoy it thinking that your turned into the HULK or batman. Believe me when I took it back to the store they asked to check it before refunding me the money and the store manager immediately refunded back the money to me, guys were in the end of 2010 and this is the lowest ever image quality I have seen since 5 years.
Audio Quality: I was astonished by the idea that 4 built in microphones, thinking that I will have a great sound, it appeared that my voice was turned into E.T. Voice some how, my voice is chopped and it was more like robot then human, it's not at all a good microphones, tested on windows and PS3

Good:

1- it has an optical zoom
2- it looks good only.

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,4,Nice fun games for the family,"The camera is great with some of the family games out for it now. It seems to run lag free and very smooth. I tested this with a friend in video chat and we could see and hear each other without any problems. I do have to say this and trust me I am no fanboy but this camera with some games have kinect aspects. I was playing a game with an aquarium and could run my hand throw the water and touch the fish so I thought that was cool. As for the future of this I am excited to see what Move has in store.

Main review:

Concept design: It is a bit bulky and weird in shape but it works. I have dropped this a couple times but it works perfect still, take in the fact that I didn't drop this like 15 ft in the air, a good 5ft onto tile. It also has a nice tilt function so if you place the camera high up you can still aim the camera down.

Visual: For a simple camera it really does well at Hi-Res without any lag what so ever. But then again it does matter how much movement and how many objects are in the camera to pick up. As just one person playing casually it gets the job done. It is not that hard to focus you just need someone else to focus for you while you stay in the one spot, or just set an object in the desired aiming location and focus from there.

Audio: I have noticed that sometimes the noise cancelling technology doesn't work to well, but this is only minor. It does however pick up me sitting from 15ft away just fine without having to yell which is very nice.

Games: As of now there aren't a ton but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eye-of-Judgment/dp/B000R3BLAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eye of Judgment</a>&nbsp;this is a fun game if you like magic the gathering card game or just collecting cards. There are also some nice family games on the PSN to buy.

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,4,Good Little Moderately Priced Web Cam,"I had the PS2 Eye Toy, which worked with the PS3 (For anyone considering a low cost alternative these sell used for about $5 and are readily available).

I decided to ""Upgrade"" for the zoom, better low light performance, built in microphones and for the downloadable software which will only work with the ""new"" Eye.

The video quality is definitely better. I run a projector so the light I have is minimal. The chat feature on PS3 sets a white background and this (on a 100"" screen) is more than adequate to illuminate me on my old sofa. Unfortunately most of the other stuff (Fish tank and Editing Software) need more light to work properly).

As far as the microphone - you would be far better served with a Bluetooth headset. The 4 microphone configuration works decent, but the (output) volume seems low, it should be very close to you if you don't want to annoy the person on the other end whom you are communicating with.

For what this thing sells for I do believe it to be well worth the money, just don't expect it to do magic. The PS3 video of this little device makes it seem better than it is - but that could be said for basically all advertising.

On a side note your internet connection speed and the Sony servers are of more importance for a decent video chat session than the camera and microphone themselves.

Additionally ""Home"" currently has no web cam support and has limited (audio) chat capabilities. It's still in Beta though...

But even then, there are rumors of allowing you to import your photos from memory cards. So you may not need it down the road.

I downloaded the free Eye Create software from the Playstation Network. (This accessory is useless if you don't have access to the free Plaaystation Network since it doesn't come with a software disc).

So this product should be evaluated in conjunction with the Eye Create software since that's what you need to record photos and video. I found the software to have very awkward controls. And you don't even capture photos/video at full screen, it's only part of the screen. Plus the editing features such as effects filters are nothing that you really haven't seen before. If you have a Macbook or iMac with a built-in iSight camera, then you will not be impressed at all by this software since it is much more limited. I was also hoping to record some time lapse of my living room. The video seems to stop recording after an hour of recorded content. If you're recording non-time lapse video, you can record up to 45 minutes worth. This is true even  your PS3 harddrive is empty since there is a size cap within this software.

If you were to compare the Eye Create software to shareware that you can download for your webcam, then this would be shareware that you would not want to pay for. It's that bad.",12-13-2008

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,5,We didn't know we wanted it until...,"We have&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LittleBigPlanet/dp/B001IVXI7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LittleBigPlanet</a>&nbsp;on order and my expectation is that we will be able to use the Eye to create our own levels.

We didn't know we wanted it until we bought a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eye-of-Judgment/dp/B000R3BLAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eye of Judgment</a>&nbsp;which had the Eye included (I believe that this is no longer the case today). It's been almost a year since an Eye was attached to our PS3 and... it stayed attached and the PS3 is a better, more interesting console because of it.

Those were the early PS3 days and applications were scarce but, slowly, the PSN store began to offer little, free or inexpensive but fun 'Eye' games that were relying on the Eye as an input device - interpreting hands or body movements. For $2 or $3 the kids were able to play with the fish in an aquarium, help little cute creatures escape little but evil creatures by waving the bad ones away or bouncing the cute ones out of danger, navigate fantastic landscapes. Other, more 'serious' apps followed and the kids can now make and edit their own videos and experiment with special effects.

Overall, the quality of the picture is decent. Our 'media room' is not the brightest place in the world and yet the kids can make videos and have fun without additional bright lights. A stereo microphone is part of the camera body and, by simply having the Eye attached to the PS3 via a USB wire we are using it to chat with whomever happens to be at the other side of an online game.

The Eye (with proper software) allows the following on a PS3:
- made and edit videos
- chat/video chat
- interpret/recognize patterns (Eye of Judgement)
- interpret and recognize gestures or body movements
- capture 'real world' objects and then insert them into your own game

If you are buying this for video conferencing or video chats, please check other reviews because I haven't tried it for anything 'serious' yet.",10-29-2008

The camera works nicely with several free-mini apps that can be downloaded from the PS store, like Aquarium and (some artsy thing) that reads the kids interactions. For example, in the aquarium, you can feed the fish by wiggling your hands 'above' the tank.",10-27-2008

I wud like to have 2 more ones for my PC and my xbox 360 but they are incompatable? is this a flaw or design stratagy?

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,5,Great item!!,"First of I want to say this camera is very well-built. It has fallen off the top of my TV about 14 times and still works 100% efficiently.

I bought my PS Eye in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eye-of-Judgment/dp/B000R3BLAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eye of Judgment</a>&nbsp;pack but I feel qualified that I can review the single product as this is just the PS Eye without the game or cards.

This device has both a camera and microphone. The camera part has its uses as a web-cam, and a motion-capture device while the microphone acts as a microphone should except this contains 4 mics and noise cancellation technology so you can speak to people in game without having your entire family in the conversation.

The camera has it's uses in the game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burnout-Paradise/dp/B000MUW98O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burnout Paradise</a>&nbsp;in which while playing online the loser of a race gets their picture taken with whatever expression they have on their face at the time if they are sitting in front of it.

As for the motion capture there are currently about 4 PSN downloadable titles that cost $2 and the Eye of Judgment game listed above that use the feature. Typically these games are mainly interacting with moving colors or flying around but there is one game, forget title at the moment, that allows you to push a ball around an optical course on top of a castle. Its quite fun.

Overall the fact Sony is actually supporting the PS Eye as well as they are is definitely a good sign to what is there to come.",01-23-2008

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,5,The EYES Have It,"I can't get the name Eye Toy out of my head.  The familiar camera for the PS2 now has a very new and classy look on the PS3.  Say hello to the mature Playstation Eye.  If you had a Playstation Eye for the Playstation 2 you are probably aware of the interactivity that was available.  Now with the newest edition Eye that is taken up one level to a whole new dimension.

Getting my hands on this has been a few weeks in coming.  Deciding on whether I wanted to purchase it with a game is what kept me.  In reality I didn't need a card game so I purchased this for the measely sum of $40 and now I have this beautiful contraption.  Once you open the package there is not much to it.  Connect the 6 foot usb cord to the PS3 and go to device settings and make sure your PS3 is aware it has a camera.  No installation here which makes life that much easier.

If you have access to the Playstation Network you can download the Eye Create software for free.  A rather small and unassuming file packed with punch.  I really didn't expect much from a free program but I was in for a big surprise.  The program is actually an editing program and a very simple but very good one at that.  The program allows for capturing video, sound, and pics.  You can then edit your masterpiece to create a decent home movie.  I am still unaware as to whether I can upload the videos onto Youtube or mail them to others on my friend list.  This is a great little bonus program to owning the Eye.

As of now there are a couple mini games available at a low price on the PSN.  And of course they are interactive with the Eye.  The first game is actually an aquarium.  I don't know as much for a game as an interactive screen saver that would be nice when your entertaining.  The camera captures movement and gives your slight reflection as if looking into aquarium glass.  You can move your arms around to spook the fish and then you can act like your dropping your hand in the water to see the slight ripple.  Pretty cool little trick.

The other game is kind of silly but the kids will love it.  The object is to save these little mindless creatures.  By using your hands to move them to safety.  The game starts off rather easy and gets more complex.  Most adults may get bored but I can see how a child would have a lot of fun with the interaction.

Of course this is just the beginning of numerous interactive games that will be available for many months on the PSN.  No word as to whether they will offer these games in a collection on the disc.  The first major game to utilize the Eye will be Sing Star.  It will allow you to show off your singing skills to others.

Now I have just mentioned a few of the advantages of the Eye and of course there is the Eye of Judgement game many people have raved about.  But I enjoy this camera for the ability to have video chats.  I had a video chat and the picture looked great.  Very clear and able to handle low light.  What was also impressive was it moved at normal speed thanks to the cameras ability to move 120 frames per second.  Having a conversation with someone looks normal and not like they are moving in slow motion.  The microphone picks up sound extremely well and the voice conversation comes out great.  The PS3 allows for video confrencing with 4 people.  For the quality it is one of the best and cheapest video confrencing programs available.

I would have to say the Playstation Eye is a shining feature on the PS3.  If you are looking for something that will continue to reward you over the coming months with new games and the ability to actually see the people you talk to the Playstation Eye is where it's at.  Great for kids or adults it's a great value.",11-24-2007

The EyeToy comes bundled with the game, a deck of cards, a playing mat, a stand for the camera & a pack of booster cards, all for about $20 more than the EyeToy costs solo, sounds like a great deal to me, & you'll have something to play until all the other stuff gets released on the PSN !",11-12-2007

It does not have Sony's name on it as described. BUT it does work perfectly well. It is my very first camera. I bought it so that I can play the Just Dance games. It seems to work fine. All the commands are being met and it is good quality. The reason I didn't give it 5 out of 5 is because, 1. The item came with nothing at all. No instructions (although it was simple to use) no installation discs. Nothing. 2. It came in a box that made the whole thing look used, as if I bought a second hand product. I have to say though, that this thing didn't look used. But the box it came it made the whole thing look used. and 3. It was advertised as being Sony, and it isn't.
I do not plan on returning it because it is serving its purpose and I am having a great time using it.",03-02-2016

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,4,The best price ever for a first-party accessory,"The best price ever for a first-party accessory. I don't use the camera function of this device much, but it's picture quality is not terrible: grainy, yet bright. Granted, my living room isn't the best lit, so while I say the camera picture is grainy, you could interpret that to mean that it's excellent in low-light environments. Like I said, though, I don't use the camera functions.
I bought this camera because I am sick and tired of wearing a bluetooth headset just to yell at foo's on the Internet. I solely use this camera for the microphone functions. I can speak, people can hear me, I can hear them (out of my TV speakers). There doesn't seem to be much feedback or echoing, but that will depend on how far away you are from the TV, the acoustic properties of the room you're in, and how far away your speakers are from the camera.
My only complaint has to lie with Sony, who, through a past firmware update, limited the microphone volume of their first-party devices (camera and bluetooth mic) to level 3 rather than the maximum level 5. They purportedly did this to cut down on the number of people who were simply too loud when playing their video games. This limitation is apparently not present on third-party devices.",08-06-2014

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,5,Works as its supposed to,"I bought this used. Here are my pros and cons.
Pros
1. It's cheap.
2. It works.
3. The cable is very long meaning I can put this anywhere.

Cons
1. None yet. Unless it breaks, it'll remain none.

I bought this for 2 things. As a PS-Eye but I also plan on using this for some 3D modeling applications. Should be fun and if you're going that route, it can't hurt to pick up one of these. It's like $15, what can you possibly lose? (aside from, yknow, $15 lol). Anyway. This worked as intended. Would recommend.",02-17-2014
https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,3,Ok,"I have the kinect and wondered how good this was so I purchased it with sports champions and one move controller. After many sessions to me it's almost the same as kinect they both aren't that accurate but it was an okay experience. My only complaint about this is the requirement of the silly looking move controller (love the light up colors!).

For some games you will find you need more than one move controller (like archery, volleyball, etc) it's optional but in the long run will benefit you better ($$$). It's simple to setup just plug in the usb to your PS3 and that's it no power cord/usb combo like kinect. In my opinion the catalog of games for playstation move is weak resistance, house of the dead, time crisis, little big planet franchise, and sports champions (1&2) stand out the most.

Seems like with most games like sports champion you don't really have to be as active like kinect. I guess that's a plus if you don't want to move around a lot? I feel this is where the accuracy gets hurt because in situations where you have to dodge or jump you don't really have to as you would with a kinect. Feels like a rip off but whatever.

In my opinion kinect is better no extra accessories are needed (playing a shooting game is understandable) but as I stated earlier even kinect is not that accurate either. Sadly the ps eye doesn't take commands like kinect that would of been nice addition but oh well. My final thought on this product is it's definitely not something you really really need but is okay to have personally I would play kinect more.",02-06-2014

Applications to watch movies and shows, applications to view the web, applications to buy new games for either your PS3, PSP, or PS Vita, and even applications that let you connect with other people so you can chat with them.

The Playstation Eye is the ideal chatting device. It's a 2 in one device that is perfect if you plan to chat with someone. It's a Cam and a microphone at the same time. Because the cam is from Sony, it works perfectly with the PS3. The cam takes really good video as well as the microphone has pretty good sound and can pick up your voice very well, so long as you are in good range. Ever since the cam game out, there have been applications to let you video record, sound record, and take pictures for whatever the reason.

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,5,Perfect for Raspberry Pi,"This has come down in price considerably over the years, and I bought one recently for use with my Raspberry Pi. The graphics quality is significantly better than other webcams in the sub-twenty-dollar range (I've looked at many for a robotics project), and audio is also exceptional (the audio I had to confirm with a PC at work, as I'm not using that aspect with the Pi yet).

Note that this will not work with a Mac, at least without a fair bit of finagling. However, it works fine with the Pi. For the price, I really could not ask for more.

Also, if you're interested in Raspberry Pi video input, the OEM Raspberry Pi camera provides better video due to the built-in connector, but it is extremely delicate (I've already damaged one with a very minor drop - something I'd never have expected to cause a problem), and you're limited by the short ribbon cable (which can be extended but which is still not very flexible). This provides much of the capability for less money and with more durability.",08-19-2013

When hooked up to my laptop it's able to capture in 640x480 at 45fps.  It could probably work a little better on a more powerful computer but even at that rate it works.  I can record a lift and then walk over and watch it immediately.  With kinovea you can watch in slow motion and draw on it.  You can also track your bar path.

The Move system seems to be more particular and sometimes harder to sync than the Wii we have used (thus, I believe an adult is often needed to set up the system for kids--I don't believe that is the case with the Wii).  We just got our Move system last week and already have ~5 games and are really enjoying it-- a very nice family option that gets you off the couch.  That being said, part of me thinks I should have just purchased a Wii (even though it doesn't have some of the Move features).",01-14-2012
https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,4,"A review from non-gamer, just video chat perspective","I got this so that we can use it for chatting with family. There is something about just firing up the TV and watching the family on the other side of the.... highway.

Quick summary: I don't think it is a good alternative to Skype.

Issues:

1. You have to turn on TV, PS3, if camera is not plugged in then plug it in.
2. Start the chat app.
3. If the party you want to chat is not available, then either call them or turn off everything. Or the worse, call them and they are busy.
4. Picture quality is ok. In dim light, it is very hard to see facial expressions.
5. Sound can lag or distort. Tested it with 6Mbps & 25Mbps. Both speeds have sound lag and sometimes distorted sound.
6. Cannot do anything else, like watching TV or movie... duh! Makes it awkward when there is nothing else to talk about. Cannot send links or photos.

Basically, I was thinking that it would be easier than using Skype on laptop.

I still gave it four stars b/c it seems very solid piece of hardware. I got Michael Jackson Move game and it seems to work very well. I suppose it works well for it's primary purposes which is gaming. Also it is pretty exciting to see your family on huge TV. Just needed right expectations to avoid any disappointments.",12-12-2011
https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,3,Where are the games?,"So I bought the Playstation Move assuming Sony was planning on releasing some games for it.  It's been quite awhile since any games have come out.  Seeing that the prices have dropped quite a bit over the past few months, maybe Sony is planning on getting the Move in more people's homes so that game maker's will actually want to make games for it.  As it is now, I wouldn't but it but if you do, there are two or three games that I'd highly recommend.

I had to call Playstation customer service and asked them to email me the instructions they also said that their items always come in official Playstation packaging no matter who they sell to. By buying this from Worldwide Distributors I did not get original packaging, instructions,and the manufacturers warranty which is typically 1 year which gives me peace of mine for 1 year. My advice to you is to make sure it's shipped and sold by  amazon if not get it from the store for around 3-4 dollars more u get the warranty, instructions and packaging which is a must for gifting.

Reasons for lower stars, It doesn't want to stay upright because the cord (the way the packaged it made it have lots of bends) keeps pulling it/weighing it down. The camera is so light it can't really hold itself up. Easily fixed by duct taping it to the surface.

Wait wait, with Sony eye you will go back to tradition :) where 3D and FHD or HD is not important, your going back to the 4:3 aspect ratio, and the lovely poor colors :)

I thought for the first time I've seen my self on this camera that I'm the hulk since I turned in green color thanks to Sony great Technology.

This camera has a good concept but:

1- image quality is SD don't expect anything, it has the DOOM resolution :)
2- colors are terrible, however you might enjoy it thinking that your turned into the HULK or batman. Believe me when I took it back to the store they asked to check it before refunding me the money and the store manager immediately refunded back the money to me, guys were in the end of 2010 and this is the lowest ever image quality I have seen since 5 years.
Audio Quality: I was astonished by the idea that 4 built in microphones, thinking that I will have a great sound, it appeared that my voice was turned into E.T. Voice some how, my voice is chopped and it was more like robot then human, it's not at all a good microphones, tested on windows and PS3

Good:

1- it has an optical zoom
2- it looks good only.

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,4,Nice fun games for the family,"The camera is great with some of the family games out for it now. It seems to run lag free and very smooth. I tested this with a friend in video chat and we could see and hear each other without any problems. I do have to say this and trust me I am no fanboy but this camera with some games have kinect aspects. I was playing a game with an aquarium and could run my hand throw the water and touch the fish so I thought that was cool. As for the future of this I am excited to see what Move has in store.

Main review:

Concept design: It is a bit bulky and weird in shape but it works. I have dropped this a couple times but it works perfect still, take in the fact that I didn't drop this like 15 ft in the air, a good 5ft onto tile. It also has a nice tilt function so if you place the camera high up you can still aim the camera down.

Visual: For a simple camera it really does well at Hi-Res without any lag what so ever. But then again it does matter how much movement and how many objects are in the camera to pick up. As just one person playing casually it gets the job done. It is not that hard to focus you just need someone else to focus for you while you stay in the one spot, or just set an object in the desired aiming location and focus from there.

Audio: I have noticed that sometimes the noise cancelling technology doesn't work to well, but this is only minor. It does however pick up me sitting from 15ft away just fine without having to yell which is very nice.

Games: As of now there aren't a ton but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eye-of-Judgment/dp/B000R3BLAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eye of Judgment</a>&nbsp;this is a fun game if you like magic the gathering card game or just collecting cards. There are also some nice family games on the PSN to buy.

Overall: It is nice to have if you are looking to the future of gaming or just looking to chat and take pictures. It is sometimes better to buy the camera in a bundle pack though, if you like the game it comes with.",07-27-2010

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,4,Good Little Moderately Priced Web Cam,"I had the PS2 Eye Toy, which worked with the PS3 (For anyone considering a low cost alternative these sell used for about $5 and are readily available).

I decided to ""Upgrade"" for the zoom, better low light performance, built in microphones and for the downloadable software which will only work with the ""new"" Eye.

The video quality is definitely better. I run a projector so the light I have is minimal. The chat feature on PS3 sets a white background and this (on a 100"" screen) is more than adequate to illuminate me on my old sofa. Unfortunately most of the other stuff (Fish tank and Editing Software) need more light to work properly).

As far as the microphone - you would be far better served with a Bluetooth headset. The 4 microphone configuration works decent, but the (output) volume seems low, it should be very close to you if you don't want to annoy the person on the other end whom you are communicating with.

For what this thing sells for I do believe it to be well worth the money, just don't expect it to do magic. The PS3 video of this little device makes it seem better than it is - but that could be said for basically all advertising.

On a side note your internet connection speed and the Sony servers are of more importance for a decent video chat session than the camera and microphone themselves.

Additionally ""Home"" currently has no web cam support and has limited (audio) chat capabilities. It's still in Beta though...

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,2,"If you don't have Little Big Planet, Don't Buy This","The main reason for getting the PS3 Eye is to use for capturing photos to use in Little Big Planet. But even then, there are rumors of allowing you to import your photos from memory cards. So you may not need it down the road.

I downloaded the free Eye Create software from the Playstation Network. (This accessory is useless if you don't have access to the free Plaaystation Network since it doesn't come with a software disc).

So this product should be evaluated in conjunction with the Eye Create software since that's what you need to record photos and video. I found the software to have very awkward controls. And you don't even capture photos/video at full screen, it's only part of the screen. Plus the editing features such as effects filters are nothing that you really haven't seen before. If you have a Macbook or iMac with a built-in iSight camera, then you will not be impressed at all by this software since it is much more limited. I was also hoping to record some time lapse of my living room. The video seems to stop recording after an hour of recorded content. If you're recording non-time lapse video, you can record up to 45 minutes worth. This is true even  your PS3 harddrive is empty since there is a size cap within this software.

If you were to compare the Eye Create software to shareware that you can download for your webcam, then this would be shareware that you would not want to pay for. It's that bad.",12-13-2008

It's been almost a year since an Eye was attached to our PS3 and... it stayed attached and the PS3 is a better, more interesting console because of it.

Those were the early PS3 days and applications were scarce but, slowly, the PSN store began to offer little, free or inexpensive but fun 'Eye' games that were relying on the Eye as an input device - interpreting hands or body movements. For $2 or $3 the kids were able to play with the fish in an aquarium, help little cute creatures escape little but evil creatures by waving the bad ones away or bouncing the cute ones out of danger, navigate fantastic landscapes. Other, more 'serious' apps followed and the kids can now make and edit their own videos and experiment with special effects.

Overall, the quality of the picture is decent. Our 'media room' is not the brightest place in the world and yet the kids can make videos and have fun without additional bright lights. A stereo microphone is part of the camera body and, by simply having the Eye attached to the PS3 via a USB wire we are using it to chat with whomever happens to be at the other side of an online game.

The Eye (with proper software) allows the following on a PS3:
- made and edit videos
- chat/video chat
- interpret/recognize patterns (Eye of Judgement)
- interpret and recognize gestures or body movements
- capture 'real world' objects and then insert them into your own game

I purchased it for $37 total with shipping from Amazon and I see it locally for $39.99 With the downloaded games Aquatopia and Mesmerize and a few others Plus the video and snapshot record features will keep me and my kids having fun.",02-05-2008

The mic blew me away, though. I was sitting 10 ft back and it picked me up great.  The software comes from the PSN store.  So, make sure you have internet access.

https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Eye-3/dp/B000VTQ3LU,7,Video Games,PlayStation Eye,4.4,5,Great item!!,"First of I want to say this camera is very well-built. It has fallen off the top of my TV about 14 times and still works 100% efficiently.

I bought my PS Eye in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eye-of-Judgment/dp/B000R3BLAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eye of Judgment</a>&nbsp;pack but I feel qualified that I can review the single product as this is just the PS Eye without the game or cards.

This device has both a camera and microphone. The camera part has its uses as a web-cam, and a motion-capture device while the microphone acts as a microphone should except this contains 4 mics and noise cancellation technology so you can speak to people in game without having your entire family in the conversation.

The camera has it's uses in the game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burnout-Paradise/dp/B000MUW98O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burnout Paradise</a>&nbsp;in which while playing online the loser of a race gets their picture taken with whatever expression they have on their face at the time if they are sitting in front of it.

As for the motion capture there are currently about 4 PSN downloadable titles that cost $2 and the Eye of Judgment game listed above that use the feature. Typically these games are mainly interacting with moving colors or flying around but there is one game, forget title at the moment, that allows you to push a ball around an optical course on top of a castle. Its quite fun.

Overall the fact Sony is actually supporting the PS Eye as well as they are is definitely a good sign to what is there to come.",01-23-2008

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,4,"Beautiful game world, fun to play","This review is for the PS4 version.

After recently finishing DA: Inquisition and dealing with some of the frustrations of the gameplay in terms of the environment and character movement, the smoothness of the game world and character movement felt refreshing with this game.  HZD feels in a lot of ways similar to the Far Cry games with a bit of FC Primal and Witcher mixed in.  I am a fan of that series, recently completing Primal.  So if you like FC, especially Primal, you will most likely like HZD.

The graphics are some of the best I have seen on the PS4, with beautiful scenery, water features that look nearly real, and detailed environments and creatures.  The gameplay feels so smooth and easy to use as compared to my recent experience with DA.  In a lot of respects, the gameplay style is similar to my experience in the FC series, in terms of how you play the game.

The game world is a large open world with a lot of different things to explore and experience.  I was not a bit fan of the method of fast travel that the game has as well as the save point locations, but those complaints are really minor.

Probably my biggest complaint of the game is that the menus feel a bit cluttered and could have been better organized to make it easier to find the things you are looking to do.  The game also doesnt always explain well how to do certain things as well, which was a bit of an annoyance to me at times.

The story is a decent one, although could have been executed a bit better.  I think the game tends to rely on finding information on audio and documents a bit too much and leaves conversations a bit sparse among some of the characters in the game.

As it is with these games, some of the side and collecting quests get old pretty quickly.

Even with some of its shortcomings, the pros far outweigh the cons and I am enjoying this game.

In all honesty this game shares many gameplay mechanics with those previous open world games mentioned, its loaded with collectables, towers and challenges a la Ubisoft, so unsurprisingly those activities tended to get monotonous after a short while. But, in spite of those hindrances this game is the most beautiful open world I've seen and in the end fighting robot dinosaurs is indeed as fun as it sounds. Most importantly the game has an intriguing and mysterious plot that keeps you compelled throughout and ends pretty nicely. 9/10.

  IGN: review on (Horizon Zero Dawn) an if you know (IGN) you know that a review like this must mean its a truly remarkable game
Theres something about being dropped into a brand new game world and finding it to be dense with deeply considered lore, terrifyingly aggressive creatures, and tantalizing questions that leaves an indelible mark on the memory. Horizon
Zero Dawn is one of those games, and it carves out a unique identity within the popular action-roleplaying genre. Coupled with wonderfully flexible combat and a story that touches on unexpectedly profound themes, I found it hard to tear myself away from Horizon even after Id finished its main campaign some 40 odd hours later.

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Not your typical Post Apocalyptic RPG (no zombies),"Received Horizon Zero Dawn as a birthday gift. HZD quickly took over my focus in gaming. If you are a reader of sci-fi and fantasy, the story will grab your attention and certainly hold it. Of course if this isn't your cup of tea and feel that all RPGs must have zombie/mutant hordes to be amazing an amazing story, then this isn't for you (friggin troglodyte).

The world of HZD is so easy to navigate but even easier to get lost in. The visuals on all versions of PS4 are stunning, the characters are highly detailed - what other game actually renders chest hair at the same level as clothing...or actually has body hair- and just has a nice asthetic. You can spend hours exploring the world, completing side missions, or just hunting machines for parts which is highly recommended early on in the game since it will definitely help when you start focusing on the main story line.

What is really lovely about this game is that while I am sure teens will enjoy the game, as an adult, the deeper more adult aspects of the game are thought provoking and not out of place.  Plus, it is nice to play a main character that has a sharp tongue, lightning wit, and adult acting without resorting to vulgarities (no against swearing, it just doesn't fit with the game).

I was sent a foreign disc and it says right on it to not be sold separately.  I'm sure DLC won't work with this version and it's already downloading different than other games so we will see how it goes I guess.

Very clear it's not what is being advertised. Not right and I wish there was a simple way to return it without a whole process and me having to make the trip to the store to probably end up paying more. I'll just see how it goes.

10 more min for a application to download without me even selecting anything. And it says copying application. Makes me almost feel like it's a copied version or something. Really weird.

Graphics: You've probably at least seen video gameplay of this title. If you have, you know the graphics are awesome. I can only imagine how they might look on a PS4 Pro with HDR. They look great on a 1080p tv though. Some of the best looking environments and characters I've seen.

Gameplay: The game plays beautifully. There is something here for everyone, I think. There's so much exploration, combat, upgrades, different weapon types and enemies. If you like action/adventure, you'll love it. If you like RPGs, there are elements of that in here too. If you like exploring big beautiful worlds, you'll love this game. There's just so much here to do. You are able to override the mechanical beasts and ride them. The map is HUGE! The combat is very smooth and fairly easy to learn. Using stealth to kill beasts and humans is fun. You can adjust the difficulty in the game, which is good for me, because I suck at games, haha.

Fun Factor: I am having a great time with this game. I'm not sure how long it is, but there are so many side quests, that I imagine you could easily put over 100 hours into it. It's some of the most fun I have had with a game in a while and I still have so much to do. I cannot recommend it enough. Go buy it!",01-08-2018

Honestly one of the best I've played, but more so for it's gorgeous world and fun gameplay and less for it's somewhat predictable plot. But as much as I love it, there was something that I couldn't avoid noticing.

After completing the game, I found it strange that I could not recall a single bad/evil female character except for some of the faceless bandits that you fight and one of the three matriarchs that rule Aloy's tribe. You come across countless despicable individuals throughout the main and side quests and most if not all of them are males. The men who aren't bad are usually weak in some way, often by being timid, drunken good-for-nothings or psychotic. The female characters however are practically flawless.

There is a particular moment where the Sun King (possibly the most powerful man in the game) offers Aloy a position by his side, one that was held by another strong female. For some reason she takes offense to this to such a degree that the Sun King has to apologize immediately and then later beg her forgiveness at the end of the game.

(Spoiler)There are also several scenes that take place in the past where men are exclusively shown in a bad way. One is shown to be responsible for humanity's near extinction (and is berated by a woman for it...understandably), one is responsible for destroying a large collection of knowledge (created by a woman coincidently), one basically convinces all of humanity to kill themselves believing in a false hope and another who is responsible for creating an evil AI happens to like torture porn. All admittedly interesting character flaws, but none shared by any of the females. Even the evil Hades AI is male while the good and pure Gaea AI is female. (/spoiler)

Despite these eye brow raisers, I absolutely loved the game and would recommend it to anyone. I do however hope that the sequel is more open to the idea of flawed women, perhaps even a female villain?",01-07-2018

I won't argue that Horizon Zero Dawn isn't absolutely gorgeous. I won't argue that it isn't the most polished game I've ever played. Because it is. And it is. But it is also the most frustratingly up and down in quality game I have ever played, and that makes it interesting. And on a certain level, I really, REALLY enjoy analyzing things that are interesting.

Skyrim: Mass Effect OR Arkham City: Primal

A lot of people don't see the connections between this game and Skyrim, Mass Effect, Arkham City, and Farcry:Primal, but to me they are clear to see. It's got the focus which mimics ""Detective Vision"" and ""Hunter Vision"" with it's alternate HUD overlay that highlights certain things. It's got the Mass Effect Conversation Wheel, and silent ""takedowns"" which can be upgraded (slightly). And yes, there's the endless icons cluttering up the map for all the locations and sidequests that you can travel to, a ""fast-travel"" system, and even dungeons (excuse me, CAULDRONS) that feature switches to flip and over-powered bosses to slay. So yes, this game wears it's inspirations on it's sleeve. My first impression: this is the game that Mass Effect:Andromeda SHOULD have been. It's a new world, set in the distant future, that blends science fiction and primitive survival. What a great idea!

Do You Enjoy Fighting For Your Life?

Whether or not you enjoy this game is really going to come down to one question. Do you enjoy the combat? Because if you don't, you aren't going to like this game in all likelihood. Most people seem to be over the moon for the combat for some reason. They love notching arrows, shooting weak points, sneaking up on enemies, performing stealth kills, and thwacking robot dinosaurs over the noggin with a spear. In truth, the combat is deeply flawed and uneven, but some people (or most, apparently) ENJOY the unevenness, and for them, this game is a little piece of heaven.

The Good, The Bad, And the Ugly

The good points of this game are VERY good. The graphics are AMAZING. To the point where I spent a whole lot of time just taking pictures using the photo mode, trying to achieve different framed shots. The combat is nothing if not exciting, and at times, downright awesome. When the game is scripted, it's one of the best scripted adventures I've ever seen, with Prince of Persia style climbing (only better), Arkham City style takedowns from behind, and scripted boss fights and cinematics that are every bit as soon as a summer blockbuster. The problem is...the best parts of this game are few and far between, and poorly implemented, despite the layers and layers and LAYERS of polish (seriously, there are fewer glitches in this game than any I have ever seen). For example:

The story beats for this game are all over the place. There's a deep mystery over Aloy's origin, and deep drama over her status as an outcast at the start of the game. I was REALLY looking forward to a thirty-plus hour adventure to resolve these things. Unfortunately they are both resolved in the first five hours. WHAT?????? I've heard that some people quit this game after the first few hours after resolving these story elements, I can completely understand why. 90% of the impetus to keep playing is immediately removed. There's a mystery about WHY exactly Aloy was born how she was, and what it means, and there's a mystery about a mysterious evil group, but if you've played Mass Effect or Knights of the Old Republic you're probably already groaning when you discover you have to hunt down and take down the Black Suns, I mean Blue Suns, I mean Shadow Carja, I mean Eclipse (whew! I'm tired just thinking about how many times I've taken down the same thugs!). And since I've already discovered I'm a Sith Lord, and the Hero who can unite a Galaxy, and a clone of Sephiroth, I really don't care how or why I was born, especially when I've lived my entire life as an outcast and been raised by an awesome man who exits the story right after it starts. So yeah, the story isn't exactly new. Yes, there is a heavy-handed ridiculous story about the world that's so far fetched I struggled to suspend my disbelief (somehow transforming a planet is easier than hacking a SHUTDOWN CODE??????), but other than a few blockbuster cinematics, this story is told through audio logs and text documents so boring I recommend skipping them all.

It's great that there's a Mass Effect Weapon Wheel. Crafting on the fly is unrealistic but appreciated. But there is so much wrong with this game in terms of management systems of all kinds. For starters, you need to buy or craft fast-travel packs until you purchase an unlimited one. This is a design decision that's beyond stupid. There's camp sites where you can save just about everywhere, but they clutter up the map and frequently spawn you right next to enemies that immediately kill you. Worse yet they are a terrible wasted opportunity. In Panzer Dragoon Saga when you visit a campfire you can save, yes. But you also get to listen to an old man tell you the history of the world and build a bond with your dragon. Those campfire lore minutes were my single favorite part of that game, and I weep for the lost opportunity here.

The need to constantly pick up resources so you can craft ammo and healing items is absolutely ridiculous and tedious. Your health doesn't auto-regenerate, so it's completely possible to be stranded in the middle of nowhere with no healing items, no fast-travel packs, no medicinal herbs, almost no health, and be surrounded by hostile robot dinosaurs. Not my idea of fun.

Then there's the highly un-customizable outfits which somehow manage to be boring, and provide such a limited number of effects that you are constantly switching which one you are wearing to combat just one type of enemy (as opposed to the armors in Mass Effects where you just swap upgrades into your best armor which features all kinds of bonuses, AND looks awesome). Again, crafting ammo on the fly is cool, but why on Earth do you have to craft it at all? It pretty much just ensures that when you need it most, you run out of the one type of ammo you really need and have absolutely no way of getting more.

Then there's the inventory system which seems to have been borrowed straight out of Skyrim. You have hundreds of items which are pretty much useless except to change into money, constantly cluttering up your inventory and forcing you to either discard items or visit merchants to sell huge amounts, either way a huge waste of time and effort. Yuck! All of this could have easily been solved by simply giving you regenerating health! And then there's the quest system...

I never would have climbed a single tallneck or gone through a single cauldron if my wife had not told me to. After I went through two of each, I failed to see why on Earth I did it. Neither was fun, and both were time-consuming. Even worse, the game at no time made it clear that it was important that I do these things. After the prologue, and talking to several people in the village there should have been QUESTS to go the cauldron and the tallneck, and some story-driven REASON for doing so. I found the same with all the other side-quests. Whether or not I found quests (and apparently I missed most of them when I finished the game) was purely random. The game told me at completion I had accomplished less than 50% of the game. This is just plain bad design. I've played the Mass Effect Trilogy countless times, and quests are brought to your attention frequently, allowing you to encounter them and complete them naturally. In HZD it seemed like every time I encountered a quest it wanted me to go in the opposite direction of the main story, and it seems to have absolutely no bearing on said main story. Is it any wonder I only completed a few of the quests?

And then there's the combat. Oh boy. This game had a great opportunity to allow you to craft a warrior who is fast and maneuverable equipping light armor that grants greater speed. But it doens't. Light armor is simply WORSE than heavy armor. Again, yuck! NO increased agility or dodge, just more resistance to the stupid elements. Likewise, if you aren't fond of stealth (I am generally not), you can't craft Aloy into a burly tank of destruction because close-range attacks are almost completely broken, and getting hit close range can so easily kill you. Its worth mentioning that at close range dodge/roll is useless. Seemingly just being CLOSE to attacks takes a bite out of your health. I dodged and dodged and dodged...and died. This is not Nier:Automata where a perfectly timed dodge kicks off combos. In fact, there ARE no close range attack combos. :( This is even sadder because your spear attacks are so bland and awkward, and CANNOT be used defensively. You should be able to lock spear to jaw with the robots and hold them at bay. You should be able to stab at them with your spear to ward them off and get space or escape. Instead you frequently get cornered into a nook and can't see where you are or the beast is, blinding thwacking with your spear like how you wield a sword like a club in Skyrim. This is straight-up TERRIBLE combat.

Add in a run command you use by clicking down on the left stick (instead of simply running when you pressing the left stick all the way in a direction), and you have a recipe for repeated deaths due to bad controls (Aloy should be able to run while crouched, and while in combat should NEVER walk).

The Focus Vision deserves special mention here as a feature that is EXTREMELY poorly implemented. Unlike Hunter Vision or Detective Vision, this ""feature"" does not make HUD elements unnecessary (it doesn't show you where critical plot people are, or important plants are), and it slows you to a CRAWL while you have it enabled. I turned it on all the time only to find it showed me nothing. In combat it's almost useless as I'm standing there like a log while the beasts rip me to shreds, because I""m trying to ""focus"" on them to see their weak point. Ugh! What a pain in the neck!

And last but not least, there are WAY too many dinosaur encounters, and far too many that are ridiculously overpowered, to the point where they become extremely annoying, and the override ability is just about useless. Frequently I was on my way to a story mission, and got ambushed by robot dinos I had no intention of fighting, and suddenly I was fighting for my life, wondering why on Earth I had to KILL the poor beasties just to get where I was going. This usually led to multiple frustrating deaths and/or fast-traveling straight to my mission, which was incredibly frustrating because I ENJOY traveling across the world of HZD when robot dinos aren't constantly trying to kill me! Speaking of which, while I appreciate the lack of blood and gore, why are there no no-lethal methods of dealing with dinos and bandits? I felt like a monster killing hordes of both that were minding their own business, just so I could get a save point and craft items that I desperately needed.

I loved riding on dinos, but I almost never got to do it in the game and that is really really sad. I stopped doing cauldrons after two because I was almost never able to override dinos. 99% of the time when I encountered them they already saw me and so it was too late to attempt override, and they were the wrong kind of beasts to ride anyway. When I COULD override an enemy and ride them, I almost always had to quickly dismount after a short time because the game forced me to.

The Awesome

If I have so many things I don't like about this game, why do I give it four stars? Because despite all the low points, mediocre points, and abundant frustrations, despite all the flaws and examples of bad design, this game does some things REALLY well.

Aloy is one of the greatest video game characters ever created. Despite her rather thin backstory and cheesy dialog, Ashly Burch brings the character to life so completely that everyone and anyone will fall in love with her. While you are running across the game world, Aloy keeps a constant running commentary on everything happening (a trick stolen from the awesome Tomb Raider:Legend) which keeps you from feeling depressed, lonely, and desolate. Everything about this character is amazing. The voice acting, yes. But the facial animation (which is the best I've ever seen for EVERY character in the game) is the absolute pinnacle for Aloy. Her young, earnest, perfectly expressive, courageous, idealistic, hopeful face commands your attention and brings the character to life (I suspect some extremely high quality motion capture). But more than that. When she walks, she walks like a young woman (her hips sway as she confidently strides), she stalks like a Native American (hunched down powerfully to spring into action, stealthily sneaking through the underbrush), and her HAIR is a character unto itself. I wish she got dirt or mud on her face and washed it off in the mountain streams (or took a drink of water). I wish she slept in inns to restore her health and laughed and sang around the campfire. I wish she shouted out across the mountains to other braves, and I wih more than anything she rode a strider alongside other warriors to hunt machines (because she spends far too much time alone), but what she is in this game is still incredible and deserving of all the praise I can muster.

When the story in this game is good it's AMAZING. I hated going through most of the old purple-hued buildings searching for who know's what in auto-logs and such, but I loved the the late game cinematics and story-based climbing missions. The prologue of the game has thrilling platforming, rousing music, and heart-wrenching emotion (not enough to make me cry, but still). I just wish there was more of it, instead of all the open-world machine killing frustration which felt so empty and pointless. Likewise the musical score for this game is excellent. I wish more of it was slow-paced and melancholy instead of so much action music, but it's still a fine score.

And while I had many, many serious issues with the combat (that swapping out weapons in your slot is necessary, and the icons and usage of support items is so incredibly counter-intuitive, and pretty much no one uses the tedious and mostly useless traps), when it worked, it REALLY worked. The first time I encountered a Stormbird (after trying to hide from it for 10 minutes) was a battle I'll never forget. Likewise when I was riding a Strider and firing arrows into beasts I was attacking (it never even occured to me for half the game to do this), and when I was running up the hills side-by-side with a beast as we simultaneously stalked each other. These moments were AWESOME. I just wish that there were far more of them instead of so few. I longed to side straight down a mountain ala The Man From Snowy River as part of a story mission. I wanted to RIDE those majestic flying beasts. I wanted to be the one who brought down a giant dragon with an arrow to it's weak point like the warrior in The Hobbit to save a city. In other words, I just wish the game were MORE scripted.

So there you have it. This game is a one-trick pony, but it does it's trick very, VERY well. It's not the best game of the year (that's the future legend Nier:Automata), but it is definitely the new poster child for the Playstation 4, and certainly the most popular game for the console at this time. I think if you can forgive that it does not reinvent as much as polish many popular elements of game design (except for the areas I pointed out), and especially if you have not played all the games that it's stealing design elements from (especially those that did it better), you will find a lot to love about this game. As for me, I'll play this game when I get the urge to play a game like Skyrim, but want a beautiful, colorful world and strong, beautiful female protagonist (with a running commentary) instead of a dark, grey, depressing world that reminds me of winters at home...",01-02-2018

...But this game is one of the very few that I will rave about, and I have literally spent hours, hours playing this in one sitting, and said sittings have happened A LOT with this game.

I won't go into all of the features of this game, there's enough about that already in other reviews and other places on the Internet.

I feel this game really struck an excellent balance.  The game's story covers a lot, yet leaves enough questions unanswered that you keep playing and muse about what you discover in the game.  You learn about the game's characters, but the story never wanders off on a tangent.  The game's story also explores some unique situations.  Why humans worship, or hate and loathe, things that they don't understand, why some cultures empower one gender and don't seek equality, and other cultures pursue equality so much they become blind to issues surrounding that.

That's just a few examples. But, and this is a big ""but"" for me, the game never pushes past boundaries, at least to me they didn't.  Yeah, I have my own religious, philosophical, and political views, but in a modern world so open I don't like discussing such matters, and I get weary when the media brings such matters to me.  But with this game, it presented the issues in a way that made me think, yet didn't make me feel like the game's developers were trying to push their views.  Again, given today's open minded world, I think what the developers have done in this game is a fine line that very few can walk.  Also, I like that this game doesn't zero in on any of the issues.  Since the main character, Aloy, is an attractive young woman, you'll find some of the people around her will try to interact with her in a certain way.  But since Aloy is very goal driven, there's no excessive innuendo or ""mature"" tensions.  Violence is also scaled down;  You will have to fight other humans and even in many cases, act as a detective and investigate crime scenes.  There's signs and displays of blood and bloodshed, but there's no gore or sharp displays of violence.  I for one appreciate that.

Graphics are top notch.  The only immediate quibble I have is Aloy has long, flowing red hair.  Her hair is just too lively, it flutters and swings majestically, even if you're in a building where there wouldn't be any air pressure to move hair like that.  Descending downward makes her hair dance about wildly, enough to where it might distract you.  Honestly though, given how amazing everything, and everyone looks in this game, this is a small complaint.

Controls and game mechanics are tight, save for a few situations.  The one situation that comes to mind is steep, rocky terrain.  Sometimes Aloy will nimbly scale up said terrain, sometimes you have to keep mashing the jump button until she jumps high enough to land up where you want her to, and sometimes she flat out won't interact with the terrain no matter what control inputs you give.  It's frustrating occasionally, but it's a reminder that although the game is open world, that doesn't mean you can literally go wherever you want.  There are some areas where you do have to follow a linear path.  But if you're a thorough and stalwart explorer, there's PLENTY of items to find if you explore said paths.

Weapon usage is a sheer joy.  Melee attacks with the spear look and execute awkwardly a good part of the time, but they work well.  All of the ranged weapons work great, and there's enough variety in ranged weapons for a myriad of strategies to implement in hunting machines, but not so many weapons that it gets overwhelming.

Now, hunting.... What. a. BLAST!!  Hunting machines is such a wild THRILL that I constantly sidetrack from quests to hunt.  A sidequest that would take 20 minutes to complete, or less than 10 minutes if you can fast travel to needed points, will take me an hour or longer just because I always end up facing off against machines that I come across.

The AI in the machines has been executed well, in my opinion.  Some machines will borderline act like training dummies, letting you hit them as you please until they drop.  Others will fight as a primitive animal would, throwing all their might at you then retreating if they can't take you down in short order.  While others still, especially end game machines, will use everything in their arsenal, primitive or advanced, to wipe you out.  There have been times where I've been injured in the game, ran away to hide, only to be finished off in hiding by either the same machine I was fleeing from or another machine who detected my presence and went for an easy kill.  Learning how to interact with components on machines is almost a necessity.  Two examples:

1. You could just hail arrows on the deer-like machine you're hunting and hope the herd it's in doesn't stampede over you as you're firing arrows.  OR, you could scan the machine, realize it has a canister of flammable material on it's back, shoot that canister with a fire arrow and stay quiet.  The canister will eventually explode, destroying the machine you shot at, and damaging/destroying machines near it.

2.  You could try to go head-to-head with the large wolf-like machine that has a large gun on it's back and a radar to find you even if you try to hide.  Or you can equip a weapon whose ammo can rip components off, target the radar component and rip it off, then hide.  Once the machine stops looking for you or you distract it away from you by throwing a rock, you can fire at the gun on it's back, ripping it off.  Then you can pick up that gun and use it to cut down the machine.

So while some of the machines in this game are very tough and smart, being tough and smart yourself will help you stay alive and victorious.

Again, I feel like this game just nailed it on balance.  It's challenging, but not boring or too hard (there' multiple difficulty levels too), it presents unique human issues in the story, but doesn't cross boundaries.  The graphics look awesome, but aren't so perfect that the PS4 isn't taxed heavily.  The controls and game mechanics are solid, but not too tight or fine, but they certainly aren't sloppy.",12-30-2017

I knew that it was about a girl and some robots and had an open world. I talked myself out of buying it several times because of the robot thing. I gave in when I kept seeing all the rave reviews.

When I first stared playing it, I thought, ""Oh my gosh, they have created a game like the Witcher!!!"" It's not. It kind of reminds me Assassins Creed gameplay.

I'm going to give you a list of pros and cons from my perspective.

Pros
1. The graphics and design... just beautiful
2. The female character is great. She's pretty but not beautiful. She tough and stubborn but  compassionate. I like her voice.
3. Combat is good
4. Ability to override the machines.
5. Has a unique story
6. Controls are easy to learn and map is easy to navigate. (Do yourself a favor and buy the ""forever travel bag""

Cons
1. I wish there were relationships in this story. Not necessarily romance, but something. Rost is the only one I felt any emotion towards. I feel like I need to care about someone in a game like this one. Most of the characters you meet in the game are forgettable. They feel more like robots than the actual robots.
2. Most of the side quests are just as forgettable as the people you will have to do them for. I wish they connected to the story line and not just there to get boost xp or to get supplies.

If I had to compare this to ""The Witcher"", I would give it 4 stars. There isn't a game that can top that game, in my opinion. However, I'm giving it 5 stars because it is it's own game, and it's a good one if you can get past its flaws.",12-20-2017

The weapons and areas are unique, the characters have life but I just don't think it is as good as others say. It feels like Grand Theft Auto meets post-apocalypse robots mixed with mechanics from The Witcher, Watchdogs, Uncharted, God of War, Tomb Raider, Zelda, Monster Hunter. Sounds good on paper but if you already played those games you played this and its not nearly as good. The story is plain but moves you between areas decently.

I had my doubts when buying it because of all the hype surrounding it, but it's one of those rare games that not only met my expectations, but exceeded them in every way.
  Graphically, there is no other open world game that can touch Horizon. It's insanely beautiful and extremely detailed throughout. I've taken hundreds of in game screenshots using the photo mode because I constantly come across amazing vistas and jaw-dropping landscapes. The machines are also beautiful but terrifying at the same time. They behave like ravenous wildlife and they are very intelligent as well.
  The open world is varied and I never became bored with it thanks to the constant shift between environments. The world is massive and a challenge to fully explore. You will constantly battle your way to each bonfire and new location.
 The combat system is flawless. The best in any game I've played. While not in the same category, it reminds me of Dark Souls 3, because of its responsiveness and flexibility. At times this game can be as difficult as a Souls game, especially on harder difficulty levels.

1) amazing, immersive experience - enough said
2) beautifully told story, excellent voice acting and animation
3) gameplay is stunningly elegant and wonderfully deliberate; there's little-to-no button mashing here, and this is quite a rare thing nowadays.  Every action you take is deliberate (if you plan to survive); I love the strategy of sitting in tall grass, watching your foes, and planning your strategy, trying it out, and seeing if it worked.  There's very few ""cheap"" deaths, and if you got killed, it was your own fault.  That being said, this game always challenges you, but even when you're not prepared, you can find a way to win.  It doesn't require you to google how to get past a certain boss, find out you needed to hit his left eyebrow, and then do that and kill him in 2 seconds - enemies like this are lame, and require you to constantly restart.  Horizon enemies are really well designed and thought out.  Amazing.  Unlike any other game I've played in this respect.
4) everything else - amazing

So I really liked the game, and now my life is a meaningless wallow through drudgery now that the game's completed.

You HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME, if you are at all into gaming.",11-30-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,GREAT Concept With Some Minor Flaws,"Concept 10/10
When you first her about a girl hunting giant robot dinosaurs with a bow, it sounds ridiculous.  But Horizon Zero Dawn successfully combines the combat and tactics of Far Cry, the Parkour and Stealth of Assassin's Creed, and the Narrative and Exploration of the Witcher!  It does this extremely well in a new and unique environment.  If you like any of these games, you should pick this up.

Story 10/10
In the past, mankind relied on robots, but some genius got the idea to all them to self-replicate and feed on bio-mass... or meat.  So the obvious thing happened.  The robots spread like a virus and ate and killed almost all life on Earth.  Centuries later, humans live in primitive tribes and have religious superstitions.  HZD is an origin story for Aloy, a girl who was born without a mother and lived as an outcast.  But it may be her destiny to save the world.

Combat 9/10
With only a light and heavy melee attack and an unlockable dodge, this is primarily a shooter.  Aloy has an arsenal of primitive / sci-fi weapons at her disposal.  Her primary weapon is her bow.  You can equip it with arrows that do elemental damage like fire, ice, shock, and corruption which drives the machines crazy.  In addition to her bows, Aloy can set exploding tripwire traps, proximity bombs, and mines.  There are also primitive heavy weapons in the game that launch projectiles like a machine gun or rocket launcher, but they suffer in accuracy.  The arsenal of weapons gives the player a variety of tactics.  You can rush a group of enemies and take them head on with heavy weapons.  You can use stealth to set traps all over the battlefield before you engage.  You can sneak up on enemies and stealth kill them to thin their numbers.  The variety of tactics when attacking enemy humans or robots gives this game a deep combat system.

When attacking robots, you can use precision shots to blast parts off of the robot.  So, if one of them is shooting at you, you can knock off its weapon, pick it up, and use it to shoot the robot.  Destroying the components on the creature, debuff it and limit its abilities.  So, there is some strategy here, too.

All of the robots and Aloy have resistances to damage types.  Some enemies are weak against fire or ice or shock, and you can buy different types of armor for Aloy and modify it to resist the various damage types in the game.  You can switch armor with the press of a button, even during combat.  So, if you're fighting a creature that uses fire, equip your resist fire armor and its fire will do 30-70 less damage, depending on how you modified it.

Graphics 10/10 The world is beautiful and the animations are smooth.  Killing robot monsters is more visually appealing than killing giant monsters.  Monsters bleed, but robots spark, fall apart, explode, etc...  It makes the battles really satisfying and visually stunning.

Although HZD is a great game and offers hours of open ended adventure, it does have its flaws.
No Health Regen on camping, level up, or visiting a town.  The only way to regain health in the game is to craft or buy potions.  To craft them, you need to hunt animals like foxes, fish, and boars.  The animals give you types of meat and you can combine them to make light, full, or max health boost potions.
Aloy also carries an herbal medicine bag and to fill it, you pick medicinal flowers.  1 flower gives you 10-20 health for your bag.  You can carry 400% of your health bar.  To activate this, just press UP on the D-pad and you will heal.  But you do spend about 15% of the entire game running through the woods picking flowers.
Inconsistent Healing.  You can heal in combat, but not while you are getting hit, dodging, or attacking.  So, there are times when you have to evade, stand still, and then heal.  There is no Dark Souls Potion Drink animation, so this doesn't make sense.  Aloy should be able to heal at any time.  The times you can heal in combat are not obvious to the player.
Skill Tree - About half of the skills in this game are worthless.  The best skills are shoot 2 arrows and 3 arrows at a time.  This is double and triple damage.  Aloy can also slow time while in combat to better aim her shots.  This meter can be boosted.  There are also a few boosts to your melee attacks and a skill that increases your medicine bag from 200 to 400% of your health bar.  The rest (half) of the skills in this game are worthless.
Inconsistent World - This is the cleanest primitive world that I have ever seen and it seriously lacks grit.  Everybody in the world feels like some fresh faced silicon valley employee or liberal arts major, which doesn't really fit a primitive world where robot monsters lurk everywhere.  The guys are pretty wimpy and the old ladies are drill sergeants, which feels really odd.

Maturity:  This is a good game for all ages.  It's like a PG movie with no swearing, just violence against machines and human bad guys.  There isn't any gore either.

Overall 9/10:  The game is fun and will take you 20-30 hours to beat.  After that, there is a New Game+ and some DLC you can enjoy.

If you loved this game, the gameplay of Far Cry is similar, but lacks fantasy.
If you loved this game for the stealth and open world, check out Assassin's Creed.
If you want an R-Rated game like this with gore, sex, swearing, and horror, check out the Witcher 3!",11-30-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,3,More Fun to Look at than to Play,"Well, I'm sorry to be the one who says the emperor's wearing no clothes, but IMO -- shared by a fellow veteran gamer who's a close friend -- this game isn't as fun to play as it is awesome to look at.

The problem is: the battles here are VERY difficult at the normal setting.  It's you and your bow and arrow versus hordes of bad guys and robot animals, the latter in some cases sporting fire and ray blasts of various kinds.

Bows and arrows of course take time to load, draw, and aim.  The melee controls also seem to have an agonizing lag time between the moment you press the button and your character reacts.

So while you're messing with your quiver or trying to reload your health meter or craft more arrows, robot monsters are busy unleashing a mess of hurting on you, including fire, energy blasts, and the ever-effective jump-in-the-air-and-land-on-your-sorry-butt move.

I tried the game's easy setting, and that was still too hard.  So I tried the ""story"" setting -- and that was probably too easy.

So this game seems to lack a difficulty setting that feels just right.  Though I'm a senior, I have been playing video games for decades and know a game ""that plays like butter"" when I find it.  HZD ain't that game!

Otherwise the heroine here is kind of a snooze, there are untold but uninteresting intricacies of plot and place, and occasional attempts at humor that fall flat with a thud.

This game does triumph in the look of this post-apocalyptic world, the costumes of the various tribes, and the multiple varieties of machine animals.

But ultimately, is this game fun to play?  IMO no -- not like the Uncharted games, the Just Cause series, Ratchet & Clank, or others I could name.

It's a shame because obviously a lot of very talented people have worked very hard to make this world come to life.

UPDATE: after playing this game for many more hours, I might also add that the cut scenes need -- cutting.  Many of them go on WAY too long, like five minutes or more.  Blah blah blah.  Yak yak yak.  Geez, when do I get back to playing this game already???

Let me say it again: the first and foremost criterion for evaluating a game remains ""is it fun to play?""  With its daunting difficulty settings, balky controls, and interminable cut scenes, HZD falls short on this paramount fun factor.",11-26-2017

The environment is absolutely gorgeous, the voice acting is okay, but it doesnt take away from the game at all.  The combat is amazing and i kinda like the crafting system.  The skill trees offer a lot of options to enhance your gameplay.  Most RPGs offer a significant amount of side quests to allow you to level up before tackling the next main story quest, but HZD is actually pretty slim on the side quests, but they're not needed anyways.

I stopped and just looked around for probably an aggregate of 5-6 hours while playing I'm sure.  The controls are fluid and the game never gets boring or grindy - well balanced and fun through to the end.  The voice actress performing the main character does a great job (she's Chloe from Life is strange if you played that game)",10-21-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,3,... game was definitely hyped up and these reviews of perfect 10's are completely incorrect,"This game was definitely hyped up and these reviews of perfect 10's are completely incorrect. The game itself, like most people have mentioned, plays out like far cry/tomb raider/ whatever else open world game. HZD does not really differentiate itself from others, instead using recycled open world gameplay formula.
  I honestly believe people are just saying it's perfect cause the graphics and the fact it looks like a how a game made in 2017 should be. The graphics are really great with HDR and 4k, assuming you have the ps4 pro and hdr tv. The lighting looks fantastic and the detail is quit amazing. I really don't see any flaws with the graphics at all to be honest.
  Just because the graphics are great doesn't make it the best however. The open world itself is big enough, however, it's just so empty. Besides the map pointing out where any ""hidden"" collectable may be, there is absolutely no reason to explore. It's too bad considering how good the environment looks. Many times you will want to wonder off thinking theres something there only to find nothing at all, maybe just some dino robots. There is no sense of reward for exploration, just nice looking scenery.
  The combat was decent; not terrible and not thrilling. You're given many options of combat, however, arrows are really the only thing you may need. Theres traps, tripwires, ropecaster (good for flying things) but arrows were the only thing i really even needed. Theres many differnt types of those too but I only needed the ""damage"" arrows"". Once i discovered that you can freeze them with ice arrows, the damage arrows make it much pretty easy to take down the most intimidating robots. So ice/damage was all i needed. Even the armor had 3 classes: common, rare, very rare. I only needed one type of armor to survive, that being the last of each tier. Stealth wasn't needed very often, maybe for sneak attack, but you could easily go up to humans or some robots and start slashing away with your spear.
  The story was also just decent i found. You really are left wondering until kind of towards the end. Until then, you're just assuming it's an apolyctic world in which it's back to the ""Stone Age/ Tribe"" setting but with robotic dinosaurs? theres a war going on the first half so i find it didn't catch my attention at all until you explore the ""metal world"" or the old labs of humanity. There you find out what really happens and the story begins to pull you in. However, at the end (no spoilers), it gets pretty confusing and unbelievable. There are some nice twists though (especially the ending) and it does pull you in for a little while.
  The missions are not very fun though. The main missions are typical go here, kill that, learn piece of story. Nothing great. The side missions are just plain terrible. There's no reason to even follow the story of them as it's not exciting. You usually use your sense thing to follow a trial and look for someone or kill something. That is it. No reason to care just go here and come back. I really can't think of a single mission that was cool or rememberable. That's about it for missions.
  Lastly are the characters. Aloy is a decent character and nicely voiced by whomever. The other tribes can have nice voice acting but you really have little to care for these characters. The main characters in the story itself are pretty bland and really have no reason to care for most of them. You will meet a few who tie in the story altogether but serve little purpose to really care for them. You see them for a little while on screen and get introduced to another and tie in at the end. Not too much back story to really care and could care who lives or die in these tribes. The side missions, again, are even worse. There is no reason to give a shit about them or whatever they want. Looking for someone, piece of equipment, no reason at all to care. In fact, the real shame is the lifeless towns and the people who inhabit it. Theres a merchant, maybe a boring side quest or two, and that's it. Nothing else. People walk around and there's no interaction so may as well all be ghost towns. That really pulls away from the immersion. The holograms you see of the human world in the past, however, is pretty interesting towards the ends.
  All in all, i would give the game a 7/10. It was entertaining, but once you're done, you're done. You are left with a feeling of ""OK, that was entertaining on to the next thing."" maybe 60 hours to get the platinum trophy, which would be 100% completion. It was mostly enjoyable while it lasted but was ready for it to end towards the end. In time, people will look back and not care too much i think. It will be remembered for a great looking PS exclusive title one day and that's about it. HZD is basically a knock off of Far Cry with robot dinosaurs so if you're looking for something different, this is not it. If you don't mind the same typical formula and nice graphics, you will probably be entertained.",10-11-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Horizon: Zero Dawn will go down as one of the greatest video games of all time,"Every once and a while a game comes along that you realize once you play it, you've just played what will be considered a classic. Sometimes a game like this can make you mistakenly believe you actually enjoy a certain genre because it's just executed and done so well. For me those games are like a Zelda or a Final Fantasy. For the most part I can't stand those games as a series, but out them came classics that even I enjoy. Games like Zelda: A Link to the Past, and Final Fantasy X fit that description. Those are classics, but I've tried to play other games like them and I'm bored to death within minutes.

This game is an action/adventure RPG. I'm generally not a huge fan of this genre as a whole. Enough people I trust, though, said I should give this a shot. After purchasing and playing this game I tell you this game will stay in my collection until I die. The story is compelling. The acting is amazing. The gameplay is absolute perfection. Crafting is simple, easy, and actually makes sense! Saving is a breeze. Difficulty is hard enough. For those who demand a greater challenge, after beating the game you're given a new difficulty level to torture you with if you feel so inclined. I haven't cared about characters this much since playing games like Metal Gear Solid and the Mass Effect Trilogy.

If I had to gripe about this game it would be that it is so long, traveling the map can get cumbersome at times, and there are collectibles to get that really add no significant value to the game. There is a feature where you can fast travel around the map. Towards the end of the game I was doing this quite a bit. For me as a parent, I can't devote too much time to a game. So it took me quite a few months of off and on gameplay to beat this one. You can easily put around 60 to 70 hours into this game. That is more than enough. However, it was well worth it. That in itself is a testimate to how good this game really is. 10 hours give or take an hour is usually my breaking point. If I have to play any longer than that I usually move on to something else. This one, however, kept me engaged.

Side quests here, too, actually bring some depth to the story. I found myself actually wanting to finish these side quests. These also do quite a bit to help your character especially towards the end of the game.

I hate to say this, but even this game at the full price of $60, which it isn't anymore, is more than worth the asking price for this game. I always wait for things to go on sale or take advantage of the Prime pricing. I never pay $60 for a game. I only paid about 45 for this one, and it has been worth every penny. The creators of the Killzone series really outdid themselves here. Play this game. You more likely than not will not be disappointed.",09-18-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,One of the best RPGs I've ever played,"This is one of the finest RPGs I've ever played. I would put it in the same tier as Assassin's Creed IV (the pirates one, people) and Deus Ex: Human Revolution (although that's not open world). Like AC4, both quests and just random encounters can create exciting, meaningful experiences. The world is beautiful, vibrant and intriguing. Like with other games (Skyrim comes to mind), I had many moments where I simply stopped to look at the incredible landscapes and environments that are depicted.

Combat is an absolute rush in this game. I just completed my first game (hard difficulty), and even at level 40 machines that are recommended level as low as 18 can be challenging, and punish you if you get complacent or overconfident. The way that equipment, abilities and knowledge of the machines synergize to increase the player's combat effectiveness is one of the best I've seen in a game. Similarly, crafting and modifying outfits/weapons is complex enough to reward optimizing, but not so complicated to the point of being overwhelming (for me, Witcher 3 hit this category).

The STORY. Holy. One of the best single-player story games I've experienced. Does an outstanding job of answering questions while introducing new mysteries as you progress. Characters feel real and interesting (not just recycled tropes).

Some brief cons: occasional weird animations, the climbing system is under-utilized (hardly ever used the death from above/below perks) and at one point a Stormbird (dragon-sized mechanical eagle thing - supposed to be super tough) glitched into a hillside and couldn't get out; just melee attacked it to death.

If they came out with a remastered 4k version of this tomorrow, I'd buy it. I'll almost certainly buy any DLC, and can't wait for HZD2. If you even remotely enjoy open world games and/or RPGs, this game's amazing.",08-29-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,2,"A gorgeous, terrible game","Im playing a disc copy that is fully updated. Ill be fair and give Horizon Zero Dawn two stars for the visuals because the game looks good until you get to the jerky animations the characters have, the terrible movement/combat and storyline. Im so glad I got this game cheap on EBay. Such a disappointment considering how much I was looking forward to finally playing this. Its interesting how so many five star reviews received free copies for unbiased reviews.

Pros:
- The world is gorgeous.
- Some of the characters are very well done, including Aloy most of the time.
- The voice acting is overall pretty good (despite having an awful script).
The machines are cool and the story concept is cool in theory.
- The Focus feature looks cool with the projection.

Cons:
- Focus is basically a worse version of Detective Mode from the Arkham games, Eagle Vision from Assassins Creed or Wraith World from Shadow of Mordor.
- The story is so slow and boring... Im trying to get into it but it takes forever to get nowhere... The characters, including Aloy, have no depth and I feel no attachment whatsoever. She dies, Im annoyed that she cant do something, I try again. In Shadow of Mordor, I felt attachment to Talion and Celebrimbor so when Talion died, I felt like I failed and went to avenge his death, quickly. This cant happen with Aloy. Her face is expressionless and she sounds bored all the time so I too am always bored. Vala seemed like shed be interesting but the developers killed her off at the end of the fifth mission called The Proving where Aloy is supposed to be given amnesty for being born and accepted back into the Nora. Dishonored is the same thing. I didn't like the game until near the end at which point I got mildly interested but cant remember why (Dishonored 2 is awful as well).
- The animations are TERRIBLE. While speaking to someone, the camera shifts from Aloy to the NPC as each speaks. Lets say, the camera flips back to aloy, her hair will flail as if she was pulled quickly. Similarly, Aloy and the NPC are facing eachother speaking and when the camera flips to the other NPC, they will spin around as if they were facing the wrong way and the game forgot to turn them around in time. Its pathetic considering how good the game looks.
- The melee combat is awful. Next to no combat combos. This has to be the worst combat Ive played in such a pretty game built around exploration and combat. I had to go play Shadow of Mordor for a couple hours after my HZD play session yesterday, for some of that awesome SoM combat.
- You use up travel packs to fast travel...  Meaning there is a limited amount of fast travel until you find or buy more packs unless you manage to find that unlimited fast travel pack which I haven't found. At this point, I won't believe it exists until I see it. Such a stupid idea.
- The difficulty curve is FAR too steep at early levels. It took me far too long to continue the storyline because I wasn't leveled up high enough, fast enough despite doing many side missions and killing everything I found along the way. Also, no where near enough shards can be found or made to buy Aloy better armor early on to help progress along.
- Aloy hops almost completely straight up rather than leaping forward...  Its the stupidest thing to see for the first time and simply becomes irritating over time.
- The game doesnt teach you how to do much other than basic controls in the beginning. Next to nothing on how to craft or what to do in regards to modifications and such.
- Early in the game, I found my first metal flower. This is a flower that is made of metal that Aloy remarks as being strange that it grows from the ground despite being made of metal. Aloy is an idiot and metal flowers growing from the ground is impossible and idiotic.  This is an example of the awful script.

I don't recommend this game at all nor will I give my money to this developer for its upcoming DLC which is probably even worse considering it's covered in snow. Thankfully, their previous games were garbage and I never gave them my money. My money is going towards the new white PS4 with Destiny 2, Shadow of War (YAY!), Wolfenstein 2 (DOUBLE YAY!) and Assassins Creed Origins (TRIPLE YAY!). Money is better spent on these upcoming hits and their awesome predecessors. They offer fun gameplay and story with great combat and a much better experience overall.",08-28-2017

The main character kind of sucks, personality-wise. The fantasy ""world building"" is pretty weak by 2017 video game standards.

The only genuinely exceptional aspect of this game is the outstanding monster design. Everything else has been done before. It's not mind-blowingly pretty, either. If you really love this kind of by-the-book Ubisoft style game, you probably already own it. If you're reading this review and are skeptical of the hype, just watch a walkthrough.

Seriously!  But don't be fooled; even at average-difficulty gameplay setting, this game is challenging... You can't just walk into the vast land thinking you can shoot your way to victory! You have to work for it.

In order to be able to destroy the more powerful machines, you need to keep upgrading your bows and arrows with purple-colored weapons being the most powerful (green, blue, purple). In order to upgrade to more powerful weapons, you'd need to gather more metal shards, which means you'll need to perform more side-missions and kill more grazers, striders, broadheads, lancehorns, and scrappers, just to name a few.

Also, don't forget to upgrade your skills; as you gain more XPs you'll score more skill-points, which in turn will allow you to upgrade your skills from the Skills submenu. The more skills you have, the easier it'll become to get out of tight situations. For example, with the Silent Kill (R1) you can dispatch a machine without firing a shot (R1 does not work on all machines...).

Combat was tremendous, graphics were superb, and story was great as well. Even playing on Normal, the game provides quite a challenge. There were many times I had to pause and think out a strategy. What I like about the difficulty is that it's not TOO hard but if you have the equipment and know where to stealth, you can beat the challenge. The developers almost always provide a way to defeat most enemies without having to face them face to face. Most quests were also challenging. I would highly recommend trying to get the best equipment possible as every machine has unique weaknesses that need to be exploited to get past them.

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,A fanboy's perspective...,"WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! If you're looking for a fair, reasonable, and unbiased review; Im going to go ahead and do you a huge favor. Go ahead and scroll alllll the way down to the bottom of the review, then click on the unhelpful button, then move along to another review. Wow, Im not sure of what I can say about this great game that has not already been said? I first heard of it back in 2016, via Gameinformer (Amazon, I apologize for plugging another video game review site; really, I do). As soon as I saw the first clip, Id already convinced myself I was going to pre order it, as soon as it became available. So, I patiently awaited for the collectors edition to become available at Gamestop (Amazon, I apologize for plugging another store that sells video games; really, I do). Hell, the game was SO good that I purchased a 55 inch TV, as well as a new gaming chair, JUST for this game! I mean, I eventually used the TV and chair for other purposes, but you get my drift. No surprise to me, it ended up being the best video game Ive ever played, regardless of the era or platform. Ok, lets talk about 8 things that jumped out at me during my playthrough!

[1] If anyone reading this has ever read any of my other videogame reviews, youll know Im not a graphics whore. With that being said, Horizon Zero Dawn is stunning to look at! It looked good enough on my 720p 32 inch, but it looked FANTASTIC when I upgraded to the aforementioned 55 inch 4K TV. I feel the need to point out something kinda important. I think the game may have been designed with a larger TV in mind because I noticed the game didn't fully fit on my 32 inch TV (the corners were cut off, and there was no way to adjust it). It was still playable, but thats something to think about.

[2] I thought the combat was simplistic, yet fun. As far as melee combat is concerned; theres a light attack and a heavy attack, and thats really it. I didn't see a need for complex combos, but then again, Im quite biased, so There are an assortment of weapons to choose from; youll use everything from traps and tripwires, to your spear and trusted bow and arrow. At my core, Im a melee guy, so I found myself going back to my spear, time and time again.

[3] The cauldrons were pretty interesting to me, for a few reasons. There are 4 of them in total, and they're the closest you're going to get to boss battles and puzzles. When I say puzzles I don't mean in the sense of a traditional puzzle, such as the ones you might find in the God of War games. These are more of a how do I get Aloy from point A to point B? type of puzzles. Now that I think about it, maybe these are not puzzles at all? Maybe Im just terrible with directions??? The other cool thing about cauldrons is youll need to defeat a boss deep within the cauldron, in order to unlock the ability to override and take control of certain machines. If memory serves, cauldrons are optional, so if you find them too hard, you can proceed without completing them.

[4] Hey, if you're the platinum trophy type, this is a very attainable platinum! This is coming from a guy who only has 2 (including this game). The most frustrating trophies or achievements for me were those damn Hunting Ground timed trials! I loathe ANYTHING that requires you to complete it within a given timeframe. But keep in mind that were talking about Horizon Zero Dawn, so I put a smile on my face (no matter how frustrated I may or may not have been) and completed all 15 of them, without changing the difficulty to easy.

[5] So, I initially heard reports of people beating the game in less than 20 hours. I mean, look guys; this is the kind of game that can be as long, or as short as you want it to be. I took my sweet time, and played it for a personal best 113 hours. If you decide to rush through the game and miss out on a great experience, just know youll one day regret it. I suggest to take your time; what is the rush?

[6] One of the more impressive (and unexpected) things about the game was the diversity of characters. Not to get political or anything, but Horizon Zero Dawn is actually the melting pot that America pretends to be. I encountered Blacks, Whites, Asians, Hispanics, etc; throughout the entire game. It was nice to finally play a game where everyone in the damn game doesnt look alike, if you know what I mean. If you don't like what Im insinuating, then dammit, jump back up to the first sentence of this review, and follow those instructions.

[7] Ohhh Aloy, such a perfect woman, isn't she? Guy after guy (as well as a few girls) hit on Aloy, but she isn't having any of it! Its refreshing to see a female character make an impact without having to look and act like a slut. A few clowns have eluded to Aloy being a feminist, and that just isn't true. Shes very focused on the task at hand, nothing more; nothing less. Well, there is one more tiny little thing. Im convinced that in HZD 2, Aloy will be the first openly gay video game protagonist. Isnt it about time for that? For the record, Im not gay myself, Im just going by what I noticed in my playthrough.

[8] I saved the best for last! As much as I love Aloy, she is NOT the star of the game! That honor belongs to the machines!!! They come in 3 sizes: small, medium, and large (I know, it sounds like a menu), and all 3 sizes are quite dangerous. Off the top of my head, I feel like there are at least 20 different types, and they all look vastly different. My jaw dropped, every time I encountered a new one, and that feeling lasted throughout the game. Seeing new machines for the first time was the best part of Horizon Zero Dawn, and because of that, Ill refrain from discussing any individual machines (I don't want to spoil that experience). Please understand that these machines are by far the most intelligent and spectacular enemies Ive ever seen!

Its rare that a game lives up to the hype (Mass Effect: Andromeda may be a good example). Im fine with a sequel, but it will not be as good as the original. Im convinced that Ill never play another game as good as this one, for as long as I live. The only negative thing I can say about it is that its raised the bar so ridiculously high, that no other RPG will be able to satisfy me. If you like action/RPG type games, can you please buy this game? I usually don't beg people to buy games, but I need your help in making this the 2017 game of the year!!!

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,2,So-so collecting game,"I read some of the glowing 5 star reviews.  I'm getting that fake review feeling you get when the review sounds more like a sales pitch than the opinion of a real player.  It's so gorgeous!  Endless hours of fun!  The 4k rendering is unbelievable whether on a standard PS4 or a Pro!
Okay, so I played it for a few hours.  I spent just about as much time online figuring out how things work.  Turns out it's a collecting and crafting game with monotonous travel and repetitive combat. Fighting humans feels like 1990s gaming.  You shoot the guy in the face, stab him five times, set him on fire and he says oof and kills you with one hit.  Seriously, I shot this one guy eight times from ten feet away and he just stood there saying ow.
You have armor, or at least they say you have armor and they put you in funny looking outfits.  They don't actually do anything.  You have tons of weapons, but they mostly suck.  To change a weapon you have to, like in real life, access a menu.  You have to craft ammo from stuff you've collected and you often run out.  That makes combat so much fun.  Wait you giant killer machine.  I have to go collect some berries so I can make arrows.  I'll be right back.
There is a night to day thing that's a pain.  It feels totally fake.  It provides no  benefit.  It's not like you can sneak up on people because it's dark.  The bad guys are all connected psychically.  If one sees you they all see you, even through rocks and solid walls.  Ooh, spooky.
The bad guys have computer jitter.  As soon as you aim at one, from behind a rock five miles away, he starts moving about randomly.  Or he walks behind that pole because he can feel you aiming at him.  You can take a guy out with one shot to the head as long as it's absolutely perfect and of course his head never stops moving.
There are locked room boss fights because no developer can leave them out; there's a law or something.  You wander around killing minions and assistants and social secretaries and such and then you find the boss waiting to be released.  You surround it with bombs and trip wires and then let it loose and it pretty much blows itself up.  I didn't know whether to be relieved that I didn't have to work at it or irritated because it was so simple.
This game hits all my irritation buttons except for one thing.  You get to ride a horsey-cow.  There I was, sitting high up on my horsey-cow, feeling just like Rick Perry, riding on a large farm animal with a leather seat strapped to it's back.  Yee-haw!",07-19-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,3,Not as good as many other games....,"I'm sorry to be one of the few to NOT give this fame a 5.  I was really excited by the hype, and I see so many people really liked it.  The main thing I felt about half-way through was boredom.  Just having come from Far Cry 4, which I loved, I found this game to be different for a while, and then the same old same old.  1) Except for a few camps, its mainly about robots, and killing robot after robot --the excitement really wears off.  2) This game is big on ""the creep""--either you fight every single robot in your path--and there's always a lot of robots in the path-- you have to sneak quietly around them to get to your mission.  It's weird to want to intentionally avoid so much conflict in the game.  3) You'd think there's a lot of strategy in using vision to isolate tanks and chambers on the robots to shoot them off, but not really.  You can blindly knock off a lot of them to a point, and then it reverts to standard bludgeoning, so what's the point of strategic targeting? 4) So many of the robots are defeated by hitting them again and again, using avoidance or potions to stay alive, and coming back to hit them and hit them again.  The game escalates by approaching higher level robots that you have to, you guessed it, hit again and again and again again etc etc.  This is not even as good as Mad Max, where you have to figure out when to slide and turn to hit the boss in the back, or with parry, or pull out the few shells you have in your shotgun.  Nope--stock up on all the supplies to build 100 arrows and just keep firing them arrows (fire arrows preferrably) at the robot and eventually it will go down.  I eventually discovered the designers built in safe zones in most robot scenarios so you didn't even have to learn avoidance--you could just find a nice little corner, or behind a bush, or just out of range, and keep hammering again again again again again until the robot fell.  (There should just a be a button for auto-firing so you can get a cup of coffee while your character plays it out.)
Granted, the graphics are good--although sometimes overdone as the AI characters make miscellaneous frowns or twitches that show the capabilities of the designers but seem kind of weird in the story.  But the vastness of nature, the beauty of the structures, is just as apparent in Far Cry 4 or, for that matter, Uncharted 1-3.  And the sound is phenomenal, or was on the 5.1 Onkyo I played on.  But, like I said, I was bored half way through, and nothing changed that later on down the line.
Just two other nit-picking points: 1) I agree with others who've said the game should recognize some robots get eliminated FOREVER.  If you go through a big exercise to kill a major bot (say a Thunderjaw), then you happen to travel through the same area, it kind of blows the story to see that bot wandering around there like you never passed through in the first place, and 2) Putting missions at opposite sides of the world to force travel over long distances doesn't necessarily enhance the quality of the game--and you all know what I mean.  Didn't you get a sense of why am I jumping way over to the east, and then have to return to tell somebody about what I've done way over there in the west, and then go up there to the Northwest, but come down to the South.  I think a lot of the quests were designed to make the open world seem much more open than it really was.

Honestly I wasn't as interested in this game when they were showing it off at E3 a few years back (another game is Days Gone but I'm hoping Sony proves me wrong again) I knew I would eventually try it out at a price drop and I'm happy I finally got the opportunity to for $40. The setting, the boss battles, the characters, the story are all on point. Super fun gameplay, I enjoyed using all the weapons and whatever advantages to take out enemies. If you trophy hunt I think this is one platinum you will truly have fun and enjoy obtaining. The game won't be for everyone obviously..

You must play it.,"I was shocked by the intricate story details and overall feel of this game.  It is wonderful, enjoyable, and delightful to play.  At first glance I thought people fighting robot dinosaurs?  Probably a ridiculous game.  Not true at all.  The story about how and why the robots exist was very well done.  Leading to discoveries that were intriguing and entertaining at the same time.  So good, that this is a game I will keep forever.  Excellent.  I spent hours on side quests alone.  Then I searched till I found out how to unlock the special items such as the armor and weapons you can obtain from quests or other means.
The main character was fun to play.  Sometimes I began to feel that they needed to add a little more options to the dialogue choices.  Actually I began to feel like she hated everyone by the end of the game.
This is an RPG like game.  You perform quests, either side quests or the main quest line, level up and choose an ability to increase.  You have to craft materials to use for increasing gear capacity or making better ammunition.  The choices of armor and weapons are large.  The differences between armor sets is pretty large.  It makes you choose your play style and either stick to it all the time, or grind out some more sets of armor and change the armor based upon which enemy you will be facing next.  The weapons are even more expansive.  You can choose to stun or bind enemies, fight from a distance, fight close up, or a combination of any of the options.  I found myself changing my weapon based on the enemy's weakness but ended mainly using the armor shearing arrows.  This would knock arrows off enemies for increased damage on the weak points.
GET THIS GAME!  You will love it.  There is something for everyone here.  An all time great.",07-05-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,A nearly flawless diamond,"H:ZD is wonderful. Tight, fun combat mechanics, gorgeous scenery and enemies, a well wrapped story that has genuine twists and a wonderful final reveal, and a amazing, dynamic character. However, this is seriously and cruelly weighed down by poorly handled side plots, a crafting system that needed several off ramps, and some plan dumb fights.

Pros: Gorgeous scenery and models
Great combat setup (for the majority)
Great characters
Amazing main story

Cons: Worthless fetch quests with worthless prizes
""hidden"" super-armor quest
annoying, confusing crafting
brutally hard combat at times

The nits are there though. The quests and side story don't flow well and are hard to follow and care about. While I wanted to enjoy the side mission about the coup detat against the Sun God and the rebellion of the Shadow Carja, they somehow managed to make a story that sounds that awesome a boring chore.

Certain quests were near impossible, not because of difficulty, but poor level design and glitches. There are wonderfully hard fight, then there are some that're just stupid, and feel less like a challenge and more like you're being told to stick your hand in a running blender.",06-23-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Lived up to all the hype,"Despite it being the reason I got a PS4 two years ago, I got this game a few months late, worried it might not live up to the hype, but it did. A beautiful, memorable world intertwined with a story that, while dropping hints to the plot twists along the way, still makes a stunning impact at every turn. Combine that with the easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master combat that relies more on brains that brawn, classic RPG elements including branching dialogue, branching storylines, sidequests, and crafting, and you have not only one of the best games of the year, but quite possibly THE best game of this console generation. Even when finished with the impactful story, there are dozens of sidequests, dungeons, and collectibles to keep you occupied for at least 100 hours.

Set across Colorado and Utah (and bits of the surrounding area) some 1500 years in the future, humanity has been pushed back to the bronze age by hulking robotic animals. It's up to Aloy, a pariah cast out from her tribe at birth, to uncover the secrets of our dead civilization, but the past seems to be reaching out to her as well. While the story is focused on its own world, if you're willing to look, you will find real-world landmarks, such as the ruins of Denver, or an Arabian-esque city atop the plateaus of Monument Valley. Combine that with optional text and audio logs, and the harder you look, the deeper this world becomes.

Whether you just do the main story, or examine every nook and cranny of the world, you'll have a blast. No bugs, smooth gameplay that requires a bit of thinking for once, and a story perfectly self-contained that it doesn't need a sequel (but is still open for one). While I'm hesitant to call anything perfect, this is about as close as a game can get.",06-16-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Wonderful game with hours of adventures.,"This game is really wonderful. It's funny because it started out like any other RPG, but it really, really opens up into a wonderful world and even every little side quest is fun and interesting. This game can be challenging at times and has a few little things that annoy me, such as having to constantly pick flower, plants, etc...for crafting; however, it's a small price to pay for such a great experience. The characters are likeable and the there's a ton of stuff to do that can stretch for hours and hours of game play. The graphics are beautiful, but a little stylized, so not necessarily ""Realistic"", but not a complain, only an observation. Well worth the purchase.

What's interesting about this game is how they managed to keep you on your toes, no matter where you wander throughout the world. It's certainly not Bloodborne hard, but you do have to keep your eyes peeled all the time, which I love. The most important thing is that there are lots and lots of areas of the world that you will need to find on your own; they don't hand-hold you through this game. Make sure you do ALL the side-quests, Errands, Bandit Camps, etc...the rewards, skill points and new areas of the map are worth seeing.",06-15-2017

Its crafting/collecting system is reminiscent of Far Cry and combat similar to the Witcher 3 with slick movements and a tool bar to change things on the fly. I feel drawn to learn more about the lore which is unique and focused on the apocalypse that happened many years ago. Aloy has a riveting story as well, she has depth as a character.

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,4,A huge step in the right direction for open world games,"I view Horizon Zero Dawn as a huge step towards producing a quality open world game. While enjoyable at times the elder scrolls and fallout series have always possessed a certain crudeness. Combat was always somewhat clunky, with generally poor animations and the weight of your movements feeling lacking.
HZD however has created a world where you feel very much a part of it as you move through. The environment shifts around you, your attacks feel substantive, and a toll is taken on the world from your actions/battles. Occasionally when on the edges of accessible terrain things will get a bit spotty with traversing the landscape, but all in all its a great experience.
The second huge stride forward is making the main story somewhat compelling and feel like the primary reason your playing as oppose to getting distracted exclusively with side quests before getting bored and walking away.
The final notable thing I appreciated were how large scale battles with allies actually felt legitimately like they were providing a helping hand, which mixed with solid animations and large numbers of npc's made the group battles feel far realer and significant.
In terms of negative, I will say the difficulty is weird. I played on hard until the end personally at which point it felt like the numbers were too severely set against me, and that it was just tedious to fight enemies I'd gone through the motions of killing for so many hours when they were just damage sponges. I only dropped it down probably in the last 10% of the game however, and this is partially because I platinumed it, which involved far more playtime than just beating it through.
Though the ranged combat is stellar, the melee combat feels quite basic, and was a standout weakness in terms of gameplay quality.
A huge pet peeve in terms of discovering the lore of the world is that most of the audio logs are all clumped together, and that you slow walk when the focus is active to discover them. This results in an extreme slowdown of gameplay during certain portions, where you're slowly creeping around discovering the audio logs and then waiting for them to play out before activating the next. While I appreciate from a lore perspective it makes sense for the audio logs to be where they were, I do wish they had done something to make these sections less awful. If you don't care about the story or finding all the logs this shouldn't bother you too much but for me and those who were unfortunate enough to stop in to see what the game was all about during these sections, they were a slog.
Lastly, while the story was fairly compelling throughout(though you do have to suspend some serious disbelief to enjoy it), the end felt very cliche and similar to many other open world titles, with needing to rally people against a generic threat. In other words it was pretty flat.",06-09-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Great open world game,"So I took a break from playing P5 and FFXV to pick this up, and  I am really glad I did. I tend to have a dislike for vast open world games like Fallout, Skyrim, Far Cry because of all the time things take to load and all the glitches that come along with it. (plus I will admit SquareEnix has made me a bit of a graphics snob). But this game is amazing! While the graphics aren't as great as some SE games, it is far better than other games! The game has a great story (which I won't talk about because I don't want to ruin)! The gameplay is very fluid. The only thing that bothers me a bit is how slow the melee attack can be and how difficult it makes it to use properly.
To the cons... really the biggest thing that stands out to me is dialogue. Since I am a snob when it comes to graphics, this really got to me. The interactions seemed  clunky. But nothing like Skyrim and Fallout. So it seemed like a small price to pay. I did notice myself skipping through the dialogue more than say a SE game because I didn't like looking at it and  I could read it much faster than the interaction itself. The cut scenes were much more bearable, but still not what I am used to. I definitely wouldn't mark it down a star for that alone though.",06-07-2017

 There are a lot of easy achievements/trophies to get. It's the same story as another apocalypto/borderlands game though . The machines get annoying after new areas open up. They can be high levels and lurk around every corner. The platforming experience is difficult due to unstable foooting that occurs. It is easy to fall from a ledge and Aloy will not auto catch herself.
The robots really get annoying when trying to explore the map. Each battle feels like a desperate fight for survival (like the cover of the game shows). Main quests award a lot of xp which is really the only reason I play them. There isn't much to do in the game anyways. Compared to masterpieces like Fallout 4 this game is more of a casual experience without enriching character development. Overall good but wonky platforming and enemies are unfairly tough.",05-17-2017

I've played it through twice now. A perfectly awesome game, with outstanding graphics, immersive world and solid characters. For those of you whining about this game, have you even stopped to think about the religious metaphors and social mechanics the writers so carefully crafted into this game? No matter your religious affiliation, it's a fascinating world. On the subject of repetition...No, no and no. Each machine requires a specific set of skills and weapons in order to overcome. Yes, of course, you can bash those Watchers in seconds. But not at the beginning of the game, right? And, killing that khopesh takes a very different strategy than taking down a thunderjaw or a glinthawk or stormbird. It's a good long, satisfying game with plenty of time to complete quests both small and large. If you don't want to collect all those metal flowers, then fine. Don't. But at least have the conversation with the merchant about the strange and mysterious ""ritual"" cups he wants you to locate. It's a hilarious conversation. If I had a complaint or two it would be that I want more, but then I always want more, more dialogue and deeper relationships. Erend and Aloy. Avad and Aloy...hmmm, well, that's what fanfiction is for!! As for the second complaint, after the epic sweep of Skyrim's score, I was kind of confused by the complete lack of that in Horizon and left me wondering why not. Enjoy the game, the world and grow with Aloy and take the time to understand her broken heart. This is not a game to ""beat""",05-14-2017

Horizon Zero Dawn does everything very well but makes very little innovations and takes absolutely no risks.  This results in the game feeling like it has no personality and that it has nothing truly interesting to offer the player that other games before it haven't already offered.  Despite this, the game is still a lot of fun because it takes the best elements of light RPGs like and and polishes them to a shine.  It also helps that the game is BEAUTIFUL with some of the best graphics on PS4 and unquestionably the best draw distance, which is super cool for an open world game.

In fact my last console was a Game Cube, this is my first new console in 15 years.  I was seeing all my friends play this game after I got the PS4.  So I thought I give it a try.  First I decided to play on a higher level then I tried my last game one (Yes I am a noob last game I tried (BioShock) I was doing it on easy mode, I am doing this game on normal mode, yes to those great players yes I suck, but I am still having fun)
First I like the beauty of the game it is just stunning.  Second I like that I am not forced to fight, if need be I can be Sir Robin and bravely run away if I need to.
I like how they mix the difficult monsters in with the easy monsters, I am learning the skills to attract the easy monsters to me, and take them out in stealth while not attracting the big bad ones that will 1 shot me (Feels like I am doing something) and as I get stronger I am now able to go back to the ones that were terrifying before and take them down.
At times this game can get your heart pounding as, you are in a tight spot, need to go somewhere or kill this low level, but there is this massive you are dead monster right there.  Played right you can circumnavigate the big one to get the one you need or cross the area you need to.
I am looking forward to seeing how the story plays out.
On key thing I have found, the side quests -- DO THEM DO THEM ALL, well unless you are a god player and you don't need the help, otherwise you will need that XP before you finish the main quests, and just for the heck of it kill a bunch of watcher, for the XP and spare parts (oh those spare parts you WILL need them)

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Speechless.  So... Good... Buy it now.,"This is one of the best games I have played in a very long time.  Full disclosure, I bought this with the credit from trading in the rather terrible Mass Effect Andromeda, since I still needed an RPG fix.  I went into this game with zero expectations and couldn't be more pleased with the result.  The game has both great storytelling and great gameplay.  Since I don't want to ruin anything, all I'll say about the story is that it is refreshing to have a game where the plot is unpredictable.

Gameplay-wise, you are fighting large machines and humans with primitive weapons (bows and arrows).  Each enemy type has its own strategies and weaknesses, and the game doesn't hold your hand through beating them.  This is so refreshing - in a day where the difficulty of video games is lacking, it is nice to have a game that forces you to figure things out as opposed to telling you how to take down the enemies.

As I mentioned, I won't ruin the story, but I will recommend that, if you get this game, FINISH THE GAME.  Don't get through part of the game and stop.  This game has one of the most satisfying endings I've had in video gaming, and you'd be remiss to not get to it.

Another praise I have for this game is the level of risk the developer took in making this.  The premise, story, and game overall are not ""safe"" by any stretch of the imagination.  The developer went out on a limb, took risks, and they pay off.  Nothing feels cliche or overdone, and the game does not feel rushed.

The game is also one of the prettiest console games I have ever played, and it is definitely the best looking console RPG I've seen.  The best looking game on consoles is arguably Uncharted 4, but Horizon Zero Dawn is right there in that discussion.  This is a major compliment in itself.  Gorgeous looking games like Uncharted are usually rather linear.  Horizon Zero Dawn is an open world RPG, and RPGs usually are forced to make sacrifices in the graphics department in order to deliver larger and more expansive content.  Horizon Zero Dawn does not appear to have lowered its graphics really at all - compare the graphics of Horizon Zero Dawn to Mass Effect Andromeda for a comparison of just how much better Horizon's graphics are than current gen RPG competition.

Anyways, simply said, go buy this game right now.  You won't regret it.",04-29-2017

~REVIEW~
If you're a casual gamer looking for a COMPLETE EXPERIENCE and none of that ""Season Pass-Half Game"" bull crap, this game's for you!

I play video games a few days a week for a couple hours, but this is one of the very few games that kept me wanting more...wanting to explore the world, wanting to complete the next quest to find out what happens next.  My biggest regret was finishing the storyline too early.  It was mainly because I wanted this specific piece of armor and well....when you're so close to beating the game you feel like you just have to see it to the end.

If you haven't seen gameplay videos on how this game performs, I'd suggest you go do that.

There are some reviewers that get their panties up in a bunch with the whole ""religious"" aspect of the game, but that's what makes the story so unique, compelling, and dramatic.  You won't see signs of the cross or any mention of modern day religions.  It's merely tribal post-apocalyptic religions' mystery that blows up into something greater, bigger than the religions themselves, the kind that makes your jaw drop after a big event happened in your favorite weekly show.

The user interface and controls are fixed, but they're damn good.  No need to learn crazy combinations just to get access to a menu.  Every button has a purpose, and I believe the only one you'll need to hold down is L2+Right Thumbstick to rotate your ammo and that's it.  Even when you do that the game slows down to give you time to react, even when you're changing weapons.

Weapons/Armor
There's not a whole lot to choose from, and they don't have randomly generated stats.  But the loot isn't what makes this game.  You're here to hunt robots and unravel a mystery.  You can slot upgrades into your stuff but that's about it.

Combat
Fluid, and ohhhh sooooo fun.  There's something awesome about quickly scanning a robots weak spots, equipping the right ammo, and then just making it rain in slow motion.

I could go on and on and on, but seriously, why are you still reading this?  Go watch the videos to make up your mind.

Let me warn you that this game is difficult at times, not to the point of utter frustration, there may be times you yell aloud because your strategy just wasn't good enough. There's a lot to do: I spent hours and hours on sidequests that were not boring to get into or do. Most side missions will actually give you more information about the world even if they don't directly tie into the main story there will be something in the mission that adds to the overall puzzle.

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Best RPG currently on the PS4,"First I want to make this clear! This game IS an action RPG! Its not a third person shooter with RPG elements! Its a massive game world, with towns, and experience points, and levels, and dungeons and tons of quests and even a Crafting system! I do admit that the crafting system leaves a lot to be desired, but it does what it needs to and keeps the game simple enough so that you aren't completely lost if you come back to the game after taking a break from playing it.

The game takes place in the future, sometime after our downfall! Humanity has begun recovering and has become a primitive world filled with many tribal societies. Our cities have become ruins, and our everyday items are now ancient relics! Oh yeah, and apparently machines we left behind now prowl the world like savage wild creatures!

You play a young strong woman (Her age or Gender doesnt really matter to me, but there are people out there who only play games with strong female lead characters..and other people who won't play a game if the lead character is female.why? Because both groups are stupidthis info is provided for the stupid people who only care about that) who has grown up as an outcast from a tribe. She heads out into the world on a quest for redemption and self-discovery..and along the way she meets new people, helps those in needs, and fights a ton of crazy robot creatures!

Throughout the game, you will even be presented with moral choices that help shape your vision of the characterIs she a scrapper, a thinker or a pacifist? It all depends on how you play her! Basically, the game is a cross between several different games! It is a strong story and RPG world like Witcher 3, with some climbing and stealth elements that are similar to Assassins Creed and a hunting/crafting system that is very similar to FarCry! So, if you ever wondered what the love child of Witcher 3, Assasins Creed and FarCry 4 would be like? The answer is Horizon: Zero Dawn!

Long story short, its definitely one of the best games on the PS4 and is a must own title! Would I label it as a system seller? I would say it was! Its good enough to make someone consider buying a PS4!",04-20-2017

Laughable characters.","This is a visually spectacular game with superb gameplay, action and controls, featuring a character who is so over-the-top-Mary-Sue as to be comical. The gameplay saves the game. The arrow shooting works well as does just about everything else.  Some of the crafting is confusing and a lot of times you don't know what use something has, but otherwise, it's all very good gaming done right. But the storyline writers obviously wanted a female character so obnoxious in her condescension of everyone else, made to be arrogant, and the recipient of groveling and praise from kings and everyone else as to be a cartoonish joke. ""Ohmigosh you are so capable and formidable!"" says everyone in the game to her.  Textbook Mary Sue. Males in the game are like 99% grovelers, buffoons, or just evil. Even the mentor Rost, takes orders from the obnoxious 6-year old protagonist who often bosses him around and disobeys him, even while he's training her---which she told him to do too! :)  A lot of the game resembles Tomb Raider with the mixture of arrows, platforming, and rappelling - that was also a good game, but not as vast --- although Lara Croft isn't nearly as obnoxious as this girl.

The variety of robot monsters is well done, though. And it's good at letting the user opt for more stealth or action. And it's good for giving the user the option to kill in a variety of ways, and different monsters have different weaknesses, so there's some intelligence involved which is good. The open world and scale of different monsters is also fairly epic. And again I have to stress how good the gameplay is. There are plenty of side missions too. Although I wish there were more artifacts to discover that you could actually look at.  The Focus thing works well too, similar to an extra form of vision in many games to discover things, but it works well.",04-12-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,2,A Tedious Slog,"This game has a very unique concept and story sets up quite good, but unfortunately is too tedious and unnecessarily overwhelming.  I feel like some design choices hinder the game flow.  For example, the game does not have regenerating health.  So instead of taking in the scenery and exploring the games open world, Im inclined to collect plants so I don't get killed when machines attack me out in the open.  Plus if I want to travel by horseback, I have to literally stalk a machine animal and hack instead of just having a trusty one by my side.  The game essentially feels like work.  Worst, the games main weapon is the bow.  While I do love the bow in games like Tomb Raider and Last of Us, its a chore to do battle with machines that don't go down as easily like a person or animal.  The bows firing rate and speed is slow compared to a gun, so you are required to do some fine accuracy when doing battle.  So far, it feels like every normal encounter is like a mini boss battle and Im literally just trying to explore.

As someone who enjoys open world games like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption and even the just released Zelda: Breath of the Wild, I thought I could enjoy this game.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  Those games added things to alleviate experience instead of aggravating it.  Imagine if Red Dead Redemption didn't have Dead Aim, a horse or regenerating health.  Imagine Tomb Raider without guns.  Imagine Grand Theft Auto without switching characters or cars easily available.  Imagine Assassins Creed without parkour.  Imagine Zelda BOTW without the ability to climb and glide.  Imagine all those games without those special perks.  You have a needlessly cumbersome game like Horizon Zero Dawn.",04-11-2017

I don't think any of the RPG mechanics in the game are that strong but you go into the title basically expecting an action adventure game you shouldn't be too disappointed.

Then it mixes Sci-fi, Fantasy, Mystery, robots, dinosaurs, ancient tribes, medieval times, post-apocalypse, and advance civilizations. Usually to me, that sounds like a failure because it's trying to do so much, but this game is the exact opposite. The story grips you tight, and makes you want to know as much as possible and the game plays so well that you do as much as possible, and then it looks so good you want to explore as much as possible. This is the first game I have achieved not just every trophy but 100% in game since the remaster for the Jak and Daxter series on PS3.

There are a few parts where the voice acting could have been a bit better but that was the only thing I really found wrong and it wasn't even that bad. The game features leveled areas so going back to the beginning area after you've gotten near the end is pretty much a cake walk, but you never get too high of a level that the level 25+ areas(max area is 32 I think and your max is 50)  in the game are not a challenge, even on normal.

It's been a long time since I've played a game that has immersed me this much. My fiance and I fight over who can play all the time. We both have separate campaigns and play styles. I got to a point where I could hold my own (because at first it's very challenging to kill monster sized robots with just a bow and arrow) then tackled the main story. It took me several days and weekends to finish. The world is huge and you are encouraged to run between objectives, picking up resources as you go. The best way to describe this game is like a mix of Far Cry Primal, Tomb Raider and Turok. Now that I have finished the story I still find myself going back to do all the little things. It's a very fun world to loose yourself in, and visually it's one of the most impressive games I have ever seen. My fiance really enjoys the hunting for collectibles and taming of beast to ride. There are side missions she has done I had no idea about, and they are their own unique experience, not rinsed and repeated like so many games now do. I was skeptical about this game, stayed away from reviews until I developed my own opinion but I have to say everyone has such admiration for this game that reading their appreciation has helped me bask in the masterpiece this is. I really hope it gets game of the year.",04-06-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,3,I just couldn't really get into it. Here's why...,"I gotta throw my opinion in here like everyone else... but I'm aware that I'm one of those on the outskirts of these opinions. To be fair in my review, I'll start by saying my favorite game series are Kingdom Hearts, Mass Effect, inFamous, etc. RPGs all the way, but I prefer action RPGs over JRPGs, though I grew up playing all the Final Fantasy's and Dragon Quests as well (and no, I don't like all of them). I don't like playing multiplayer and enjoy single player campaigns exclusively, like this game. I'm also a Sony fan only because I prefer their exclusives over any of the Xbox exclusives and the feel of the DS4 controller in my hands. But I'll always go where the games are and have owned many consoles since the original Atari. I feel this is necessary as I don't want anyone passing me off as some kind of irrelevant fanboy. I'm hoping my review helps someone or anyone at all... if not, so be it.

I played this game for over a week, putting in at minimum 20 hours or more. Then I sold it. Maybe I'll get it again one day on a sale if I'm bored and need another game. Here's why.

Pros:
- First and foremost, yes, this game is gorgeous. I took many screenshots when normally I don't. I did not play on a 4K tv, but my wife and kids stopped constantly to watch it. My daughter said (while watching the first 20 minutes of the game) ""This is like watching a movie"". I agree. Absolutely gorgeous. Go current Gen consoles! Truly a powerhouse to display for your siblings that remember the original Mario and don't game anymore.
- A fully realized world. These developers made a world that genuinely feels like it lives and breathes. The world itself is one of the best parts of the game. The dinosaurs feel just as in place as the concept of them being a robot. Going from a swamp to an ancient ruin that is filled with futuristic technology really felt in place. I'm in awe they could accomplish that. It shouldn't work, but it genuinely does. Every inch of it is gorgeous to look at too and flows naturally.
- Aloy and her voice actor are amazing. I kinda loved that she didn't just resemble some super model in furs with a bow (though I will love you forever, Lara Croft). I liked her strength a lot. She felt in place for her given role. Some of the other actors are also amazing (though some needed a little work, like with all games.)

Cons:
- This open-world was just too freaking big. Like I said, 20 hours in and I think I covered less than 1/8 of the map. Now, in all fairness, I'm a ""completionist"" and must do everything indicated on the map in any game and usually love it... but I just got overwhelmed staring at even more space on the map then I've even covered after 20 hours. And though it was gorgeous, I found myself just wanting to pass everything just to get moving... and then my completionist side wouldn't let me. I burned out for this reason mostly... and...
- The combat in this game just wasn't for me. I listed the games above for a reason. They all move fairly quickly. I loved the stealth portions of the Batman series and begged for more and more in games, but now this game has a TON of needed stealth (if you don't want to get quickly overwhelmed and die in many battles) and I found myself either bored or overly-excited with each encounter. First you have to run into the area, scope out the dangers, set up your traps, maybe trick an enemy into walking over and water, rinse, repeat for each enemy if you can't figure out how to take them out quickly (though sometimes you obviously can as well)... but it happened in nearly every battle!  Try to run into a battle head on and you'll often get overrun. I don't know... RPGs have been fun to me my entire life because I could overpower and dominate if I so chose. In this, you'll always just kinda feel on par with your enemies no matter what (at least 20 hours into the game). Combine these long battles with an overly large map full of collectibles that you wonder why you spent 25+ minutes searching for them, and this is why I sold the game. It just didn't flow for me the way I enjoy in a game. I prefer more run-and-gun RPG action.

It just couldn't hold my attention, though I REALLY wanted it to. I probably would have continued playing it if Mass Effect: Andromeda didn't show up on my doorstep (which, admittedly, I'm loving). But I can honestly understand why someone would love this game as well.",04-05-2017

I haven't been focused on running through the story but rather doing what I can to fully explore the map as I advance from East to West. Here are my two bits thus far:

Pro:
-What you've heard over and over again about the game being visually gorgeous is not an exaggeration. From the plains to the deep forests all of the environments are fully realized and deeply immersive.
- Unlike most open-world games it's possible, if you put a little effort into it, to obtain significant upgrades to your equipment fairly early on in the game. This is a refreshing change from most games where you finally manage to get some fantastic gear too late in the game to make a difference.
- The crafting system is complete and well thought out. Materials are plentiful enough that you can always go find some but not so common that you can take them for granted. They struck a great balance here.
- Speaking of balance the combat system is fantastic and rewards intelligence. With a little thought and some careful planning you can take down even massive enemies at a fairly low level, but if you go try to stand toe-to-toe with a robotic T-Rex you'll get slaughtered no matter how tough you are.
- The story is (so far) interesting and well-paced, and a fresh take on the apocalypse. I find myself genuinely interested in how this world came to be and I'm enjoying the process of putting the pieces together.
- I have, so far, not encountered a single bug or glitch, not even a minor one. It's sad that that needs to be pointed out as a ""pro"" but these days bug-free games aren't a given.

Cons:
- With the story being unique and very little exposition given to you up front the world you're in can be a little confusing for a while. Aloy may have grown up in this world but we didn't, and the story assumes we know things about these primitive tribes and their politics that we just don't.
- The setting may not be to everyone's taste, I suppose.

To my mind that's some pretty heavy Pros balanced against some very minor Cons. Overall I'd say this game is well worth your money.

UPDATE:
Having finished the game I have a few things to add. The story that I found so interesting at first only gets better as you reveal each piece, with a resolution that's equal parts uplifting and heartbreaking. Even without the fantastic gameplay I think this aspect alone is worth your money. This game earns every one of its five-star reviews, I can't wait for a sequel.",04-03-2017

The graphics are amazing, the atmosphere is incredible, and the fighting mechanics is top notch. However, it's not a perfect game with several minor issues that could have been better addressed.

Clumsy movents that degrade gameplay in order to attain more realistic graphics (ie swimming and machine riding).

Would be awesome to ride flying machines or tallnecks!

Riding machines in tight spaces can be highly frustrating

Cannot fast travel straight from quest's menu

Sluggish movement when using focus

NPCs are pretty dull

Human establishments lack the charm of other games such as Witcher 3

Story somewhat confusing

Side quests a bit boring

No real good reasons to search rare objects

Cannot make machines follow you

Gathering itens while walking or riding a machine would have greatly improved gameplay

Navigating through cliffs or boulders can be a bit frustrating

Yes, they looked better than the PS3 and they were bigger in scope and scale, but they were missing something. They were missing what Horizon Zero Dawn brought to the table, being engrossing. The world of Horizon is beautiful and deadly, ancient and new, foreign yet familiar. I wanted to do the side quests because I wanted to know more of the world in which I was ""living"". And by ""I"", I mean Aloy. The heroine of this wonderfully immersive story that left me pleasantly shocked and passionately interested in a large cast of characters. When I eventually finished the main story (about 40+ hours), I immediately wanted to start it all over again. This game has truly reignited my love of gaming. Now you may have read reviews stating that this game is a rehash of this one and that one, and it may be similar, but has its own unique touch. It doesn't reinvent the wheel as far as gameplay goes, but it doesn't have to. Horizon just put some polish and fun onto an already familiar style and turned it into one of the most amazing games I have played on the PS4 thus far. If you are even reading this and still trying to decide if you want to play the game, then I would tell you the world of Horizon is a definite 'must' for any gamer.",03-31-2017

Horizon: Zero Dawn, with such a nonsensical name many would leave this up to be an after-thought. After all, if you can't bother to come up with a catchy or appealing name, what else in the development was poorly thought out? Well, to be honest not much. As with many games, especially ones of this nature, it is easiest to look at the whole as a sum of its parts.

The first and largest selling point of the game is the world itself. Set over a thousand years in the future, the earth is now ruled by machines; however, these are not your average machines, no, they are robotic representations of prehistoric beasts. Surprisingly, the world is much more than just said dinosaurs. The attention to detail and variety throughout the world is unparalleled in most modern gaming, not only in the machines, but in the humans as well. Care has been put into creating a world that is clearly different from our own, but not so different it breaks the suspension of disbelief required for any sci-fi title. When exploring the various villages and cities throughout Horizon, it is clear that each tribe is given its distinct culture, down to fashion, weapon design, and even architecture. It truly makes this feel like a world being lived-in.

Of course, what is a game without gameplay? And honestly, I believe that is where Horizon truly shines. It got me in the door with robot dinosaurs, but this was not smoke and mirrors. The combat and gameplay is very strategic; Aloy is given a tool at the start of the game that allows her to scan the machines, which allows the player to understand the machine's weaknesses and weak-points, and this paramount to success in the game (especially on harder difficulties) as the machines take almost no damage if not hit correctly or if the approach is not using the correct elements. Even with this information, some of the larger machines (such as the Thunderjaw, featured on the cover) still end up feeling like a marathon. The weapon variety is not the best, but it does provide the ability to cater plans to individual play-style. Prefer setting traps and using stealth? There are tools that allow that. Rather use deception and trick machines into fighting each-other? There are tools that permit that. Perhaps the best course of action is Guerilla tactics? Again, there are tools for that. Any one of these tactics can be swapped out on the fly to accommodate the environment or the given situation.

Finally, while good gameplay is a necessity, the story in modern gaming is frequently the differentiating factor. This is the one area where I will given Horizon it's sole bad marks. I give a lot of credit to the writing staff, as I can genuinely say this is the first ""post-apocalypse"" setting I've enjoyed. As I explored the world and progressed through the story, it is clear there is a mystery going on. The problem is I frequently wished I was uncovering that mystery with a different cast of characters. I believe the problem comes on three fronts: the first is that some of the dialogue is just down-right creepy. I am not sure if there was originally a plan to have romance options, and it was scrapped late in the project for some reason, but the way some characters treat you is just plain awkward. Sure, sometimes Aloy brushes it off in a comical way, but other times I almost feel like she is as uncomfortable as I am. The second is the fact that there aren't a whole lot of likeable characters in the supporting cast, sure there are some (Rost, Erend, and Petra come to mind), but the lion's share of the supporting cast fall into one of three categories: uncomfortably psycho/sociopathic, one-dimensional, or inconsistent. Some of the unlikable characters are still interesting, but the story doesn't really care if you like any of them, so in the end I don't care what happens to them. The final problem is with Aloy herself. I am not sure if, like the romance options, the story was originally written one way and there were some late changes to her dialogue, but I found her to be a frustrating guide through Horizon: Zero Dawn. Frequently it seemed like the story couldn't decide whether they wanted her to be the super-genius/virtuoso/elitist that talks down to everyone or the pure-hearted hero who sees the good in humanity, again the story's solution: Just do both. Sometimes it seemed like the story couldn't decide whether she is the curious character trying to understand the world or the character trying to impose her views on this, so the story's solution: Just do both. Sure, many of these attributes can coexist in the same person, after all, humans are complex. The issue is the story almost seems to exaggerate these qualities in such a way that she feels hypocritical, and that is not who I want to be projecting myself into.

The end result is a disjoint mess of a heroine. Aloy may be saving the world, but in many ways also comes across as part of the problem when she seems to refuse to share knowledge, explain the situation fully, and effectively uses support characters.

The complaints of the previous paragraph may seem like a lot, but ultimately I view them as a collection of minor problems holding this game back from true greatness. The world Aloy is in truly feels real, and even if I find her frustrating and only care about 3 of the supporting characters, this is a world I will still look forward to coming back to again. Horizon: Zero Dawn may very well be the perfection of the open-world formula in its current form. The gameplay is incredibly engaging, combat is tactical, and the world is beautiful and varied. Although the story presents an interesting setting, the lack of likeable or consistent characters combined with awkward dialogue leaves this from being a 5 star affair.

A highly recommended title. A must-own of this generation.",03-29-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,4,A very good experience.,"This game is massive.. and colorful and different and has elements of an RPG, on top of the action adventure bit. So its right up my alley.

The only two things  I have an issue with is, currency and the climbing mechanics.

Rise of the Tomb Raider, the team that worked on this game, and the climbing.. they are masters of their craft. Excellent job!

In Horizon Zero Dawn, the climbing mechanics.. needs a major overhaul to be smooth as butter... its not there yet. And its the only major fault I've really found with the game.

Other than that, its a long winded blast of fun. Exploring and having the story unfold. Characters kind of hit that uncanny valley territory sometime... with facial expressions, but not a deal breaker.

Currency is too combobulated... its just a pain in the butt to manage and buy stuff... all though the team released a patch if I am not mistaken on making it easier to manage your inventory.. by a bit.

I spent more time collecting the same items over and over again to upgrade my weapons and craft ammo that I didn't even remember where I was in the main storyline.  The battles were always the same: shoot from far away or set up traps to take them down.  Melee combat is absolutely horrible as your character is slow to attack, usually resulting in her taking damage rather than attacking.

There is also far too much crafting in the game.  Don't get me wrong, I love crafting.  I love Minecraft and spent a lot of time leveling up my blacksmith and enchanting skills in Skyrim, but it just doesn't fit well in this game and becomes tedious after awhile.  Many of the items you need are extremely rare, even the ones that shouldn't be, such as animal skins and bones.  Should every rabbit have skin and at least one bone?  Plus the money system is the same item that is needed to make everything, so it's not like you can just buy whatever you need to craft when you get tired of collecting items.",03-29-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Sony's next Franchise,"Guerilla Games created a game that can be argued as the best PS4 exclusive game.  Horizon: Zero Dawn has an incredibly intricate and detailed story that slowly unravels as the player progresses with the main missions.  The discovery of ""ancient"" items around the map adds depth to this wonderful story that actually took me off-guard as I was merely expecting a game where I went around and killed dinosaur machines.

The world that Guerilla Games created from a visual perspective was jaw dropping.  I spent many moments simply looking at the expanse before planning my next move or finding the next machine to take down. It's a world that appears familiar, yet so very different at the same time.

I thought the game play was great.  Everyone plays games differently, and there are definitely weapons that are more useful than others, but my style of attacking situations most definitely evolved over time.  I would use varying arrow types to begin the fun, I would throw down trip wires to create traps, or lay mines around my intended battlefield to create fields of destruction.  The ability to fight and take on groups of enemies is only limited to one's imagination. There is no unmanageable battle, yet one simple decision can mean the difference between life and death.

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Best Sandbox on PS4,"I finally plat'ed the game last night after 48 hours of hard difficulty gameplay, and I can say I loved the experience. I'm almost amazed that the developer of Killzone a heavy chunky FPS made such a fluid emotional experience completely side stepping their history with one of the best games this generation.

First off and most importantly the story is wonderfully told, and the reasons the characters take the actions they take all make sense.  It never feels contrived or forced outside of a few side quest when the people are like we can't speak to you, but can you help me find my brother.  Most of the time the character drive is excellent, and subtle.  One the the most powerful moments in the game is in the beginning when Aloy is shunned by her people so much so they won't even speak to a young girl due to cruel traditions and beliefs, and in the end when Aloy learns what their god really is and as a character gets the choice of how to not destroy their faith but also mock their cruel traditions.  Powerful pay off for something that as a player hurt so much at the beginning.

The gameplay feels like a evolved Tomb Raider, I just wish they had auto cover.  The amount of times she got almost killed cause just a part of her wasn't crouching enough behind a boulder was annoying.  That said, in open combat it's fluid, and rolling around and picking off parts of these metal beasts was a joy to do.  And larger the machine the less my cover worked since T-Rexes could literally run through them smashing you underneath.  Though I wish that in the later game, the bosses were different types of beasts instead of the same one recycled with health buffers. Since my strategy against most of them was the same the whole way through based on if they flew or walked.  Plant many many traps and lead them through a exploding hallway, or use ropes to hold them down while picking off their vulnerable parts.

My only real complaint is the resource management window is really difficult to use since it has no way to be sorted, and it tells you its used in crafting but not in what since i personally never used the element buffers, and not until way later did I realize I could just sell all my pants since they didn't make ammo like I thought.  Or a way to auto sell anything that had no value outside of shards.  I spend a stupid amount of time managing my resource and modification windows considering by the end of the game I never dipped below 10k$, to the point that I got annoyed and just bought the two resource I used the most wire, and blaze to make my traps and long bow arrows. Since the best weapons come from completing the hunting missions and after i had those i literally had no reason to stock up on anything, but kept feel it was a waste selling off my top tier parts which just took up space.  A chest would have been wonderfully to hold my parts considering you weirdly have a house at the end of the game... and I don't know why it's your house since I kept the owner alive...  (Shrug)

But again, the whole experience was well worth it,  one of the best sand box games I've played on the PS4 and I'm a huge Yakuza fan.  I can't recommend this game enough, cause taking down a T-Rex the first time is a thrilling experience all in it's own, topped off with other giant robotic beast.  I'm just hoping the sequel has some giant monsters the size of mountains like they teased.",03-24-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Horizon Zero Dawn- The most amazing game I have seen in years. (even after 120 plus hours),"Ok so I am about to date myself. I have played video games since Atari 2600 that includes E.T. Pac-Man etc. I have spent my childhood engaged in the fantastic, the different and the boring. Video games are a unique medium. Having all this history in gaming I feel that my opinion matters somewhat. At my age, I look for a game that will engage me in a narrative that has depth. A game should take us to new exciting places, and we should be better for it. Horizon Zero Dawn is so cool and engrossing that I truly was sad to see it end. I have put over 120 hours in this game. This game should be played plain and simple. For those that need more information here you go:

Pros:
Visuals::
This game is beautiful. I played on a standard PS4 but wow. The environment, the lighting the level design is just awesome. I have never seen a more detailed dynamic environment in games. The weather will go from sunny to to rain to sandstorms and actually have an impact on how you play. If you are in the valleys and a massive rain storm starts you actually can have instances where you don't here anything but the rain so tread carefully. You just have to see it.

The Story: is awesome. I don't want to spoil it for people but the whole time I was like what did we do? Where did these crazy machines come from? You will care about Alloy Pronounced A- Loy and her quest. You discover things as she does and the since of wonder and awe is genuine. So many questions will be asked and answered as you go and nicely wrap up the story while setting the stage for a potential sequel.

Combat:
Combat is completely awesome. Fighting Gigantic Machines with a simple bow and arrow and sling is insane. You will feel a real since of dread taking on your first machine. I kept asking myself ""How am I supposed to kill that with a stick."" Thanks to the focus a detective vision like device you can analyze weaknesses of the machines that can give you the upper hand. You have to plan ahead do not try to charge in or you will die. The combat is smooth and fluid. Each machine poses a new challenge that never gets old as you progress.

Environment:
The lore is awesome the people are engaging and the politics of the various groups is worth exploring. Explore everywhere trust me. There are bits of information everywhere. You have four various groups with their own views of our society and what happened to us. You have text messages and ruins and voice logs. It is crazy. DO THE SIDE QUESTS. The side missions in so many games are just filler, but this time it means something. You need people in the final battle. If you ignore the side missions you may not survive the end game.

Exploration:
It is a joy to find things in this world including finding cauldrons that allow you to override various machines that then will help you fight others in the area. I used this almost constantly once I had access to them. There are five of these and each is different. Stock up before you go though because once you enter you are there until the end of the level. You can eventually override the Thunderjaw...you know that big thing on the cover, He then will fight with you against anything in the area that threatens you. This is actually so much fun to watch a machine tear up the others and you can then go and pick up resources and go about your day.

No Loading Screens:

That is right there is no loading screen in game. The only exception is when you load your game, fast travel and when you die. Even then it is not bad at all.
The world is wide open in real time. When you travel in the open you see it all with no stops,

CONS:
If there is anything I can level at this game it is the management of supplies. You have to and I can not stress this enough.....constantly gather supplies. Thankfully the system is organic to the world. You need wire and metal for arrows and traps...go kill a machine. You need skin and bone to upgrade pouches kill foxes, turkeys boar and fish. You can find everything in the environment but it is tedious. Please upgrade all of your pouches early so you can cut down on this. You will be doing this a lot.

Look I could go on and on. Just pick it up. Play around with the skills, and just experience this beautiful game. Just one final thought. Visit every settlement and clear out the bandit camps. The merchants are worth the visit and once you clear a camp you get a mini settlement with these guys in them.",03-24-2017

The story is great and the world is gorgeous. However, I found myself bored a lot of the time and having to force myself to play the game. It's a good game don't get me wrong, but you may feel bored. I loved the witcher 3 and skyrim so I'm not new to open world games, but I found this to be a filler to wait for persona 5 to come out.

The story again is phenomenal. Fantastic writing that made me sit on the edge of my seat when Alloy learned how everything happened and her birth. The final boss is a bitch though.",03-23-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,What I Did Just to Play this Game...,"I don't own a Playstation 4.  I'm not sure it's worth buying, as I have an Xbox One and a decent gaming machine.

But I've been watching the development of Horizon Zero Dawn for a long time and oh did I want to play it...

So when an opportunity arose shortly after launch to take a long weekend with the wife and kids out of town, I rented a Playstation 4 for more than I'm willing to admit and picked up a copy of HZD.

Time and money well spent...

Science Fiction is hard to do right.  It's easy to create a bottleneck of lore where one crucial element of your story is necessary to understand and accept in order to make everything else you're making up make sense.  It's also easy to work yourself into a circle in a way in which you create your own paradoxes to your own story, thus making it hard to fully appreciate.

HZD however predicts a rather-believable short-term future in order to justify a mind-numbing distant future, and then places the player beyond that distant future to only then create a mysterious recent-history that - not being fully explained before the game ends - leaves players craving more just as the credits start to roll.

My only complaint with the story was that it waited until the very last mission to create a sense of urgency.  Compared to the Mass Effect stories, players new ""bad shiz"" was coming long before the end of each title, and while they never made you feel rushed, you felt that looming doom with the completion of each mission.  Throughout most of HZD I casually played the critical and non-critical elements of the story, assuming that all would be cleared up and eventually I might have to deal with a ""bad guy.""  However, the second-to-last mission ended by literally telling me ""the bad guy is heading your way and you have less than 24 hours to deal with this...""  It ramped up the pace in a very unnatural way.

Despite it all, the story is well worth the cost of admission, so I won't bother beating a dead Strider any further... (See what I did there...?)

HZD borrows from some very familiar game elements.  In fact, after just a dozen-or-so hours into the game, I felt let down.  ""This feels like Far Cry.  This is Assassins Creed.  This is Arkham"" as I climbed clearly-marked handholds to go into sleuth mode and carelessly slaughter wildlife to build a bigger purse...

Okay it wasn't *always* like that, but while some players may find themselves saying, ""hey this feels familiar,"" others may find themselves thinking, ""meh - been there, done that...""

A lot of this however ends up forgotten when the real action starts, and when the story really starts to sink in.  Combat is chaotic and wildly varied, with a whole host of enemies to go against, often at the same time.  The game rarely lets you pick apart one opponent, despite having a decent variety of stealth-based weapons at your disposal.  In fact, having finished the main story and a good assortment of side quests, I can personally say I never once used the craftable ""traps"" in-game.

There are a few other seeming oversights in the game - such as the fact that you can *only* hide in one type of grass, despite there being ample taller forms of vegetation.  You can't carry large weapons while riding a ""mount"" (which bummed me out hard the first time I tried), and for some reason you need 3 different bows and two different slings to fire arrows and launch bombs of the 6 primary damage types (frost, shock, fire, corruption, tear and impact.)  This often forces you to pause the game mid-action to change your loadout across four weapon slots, as you'll often find yourself switching between 3-or-more weapons during each fight, especially later in the game.  Luckily your character swaps weapons very quickly, and rarely do you ever find yourself trying to draw a bow that you haven't fully equipped yet.  Collectibles aren't entirely excessive, though the rewards of collecting them all leave much to be desired (I spent hours in-game collecting metal flowers only to receive some rare equipment upgrades which I essentially already had while it only took one 15-minute mission to obtain what is essentially an air-cannon for blasting off enemy armor and parts.)

For these handful of head-scratching mishaps within the game, there are plenty of elements that HZD gets right.  The map is deceptively large, and distractions from point-to-point travel are numerous.  The chaos of combat results in overwhelming moments of pride when the larger beasts are felled and picked clean of resources.  Stealth works very well for the most part, and when the shiz really starts to hit the fan, opponents are surprisingly willing to allow you to tuck tail and run away with minimal pursuit.  The hunting grounds missions are surprisingly fun, and the tutorial quests - unlocked with each new weapon acquired - are a great way to get familiar with each weapon and what it does.

In fact, perhaps the greatest aspect of HZD overall is how non-hand-holding the game is.  There's very minimal forced tutorial - cleverly disguised in the training of your childhood character under the watch of an adult caretaker.  Once released into the wild - so to speak - the game does very little to inform or remind you how to play, with the exception of an oddly repetitive reminder of how to select tracks in ""focus"" mode so that they can be seen when the focus is deactivated. The game doesn't tell you how to kill opponents, or how to use various damage types to weaken opponents.  It lets you know what the weaknesses are, but doesn't specifically tell you, ""equip this weapon to weaken this opponent.""  It also relies a lot on icons and symbols - such as small circles that fill from bottom to top to tell you how much more of a certain damage type must still be delivered in order to fully affect the current opponent.  This results in a display that's relatively free of clutter, and you're rarely trying to watch the action unfold through distracting lines of text or instructions.

I thoroughly enjoyed the game, and I enjoyed my time with a PS4.  I liked how certain sounds came from the controller.  I would have loved to see the touchpad somehow used, especially considering that the game will only exist on the PS4 - why not use every aspect of the only platform to play the title?

The developer is already suggesting DLC's and sequels.  I'm not sure that the former will justify finally purchasing a PS4, but I won't rule it out - Horizon Zero Dawn is definitely worth it.",03-23-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,"Don't Wait, Just Buy It","When I first saw trailers for this game last year, I thought it was going to be just another graphics demo. I assumed this would be like Killzone where the graphics are amazing but the actual game is mediocre.

Fast forward a couple months and I'm stuck playing only Overwatch, which is a fantastic game, but I wanted more. Battlefield and Call of Duty were fun for a while but I wanted something new. Given that the only other big title coming out besides Horizon was Mass Effect: Andromeda, I didn't really have to worry about what other games I could be saving up for. So I took the risk and I bought the digital version. Sure, I could have bought the disk and returned it if it wasn't any good, but digital download is too good albeit the no return policy. But I am damn glad I choose to get it digital and it was well worth $60. I would never want to return this game because its surprisingly replayable. The game has a fun, well paced story. The game mechanics feel pleasantly polished. Even the side missions are a bit deep in plot.

When you play this game, you'll notice that it takes many great mechanics from other popular games, and perfects them. Whether it be the skill trees from Far Cry, the movement in Assassin Creed, or the jaw dropping graphics of Uncharted, you can tell that the developers have been taking notes about what works. Even the inventory system is fantastic. Unlike Skyrim where you have no idea if you should keep an item, Horizon tells you exactly what each item can be used for. On top of that, the game has a side bar where it reminds you what each weapon icon represents, when you're looking at your weapons menu. That helps so much with games that you might come back to a few months later. Something seemingly insignificant as inventory menu designs, can make picking up the game easier for any player at any time.

I personally don't have any cons with this game, except that it forced me to put down 3 days of playing straight. I lost myself during those days, but it was worth it. If you're getting it for your significant other, just be pepared to not see him/her for a while. So what the hell are you waiting for? Get this game already. I'd even bet this game is going to be Game of the Year. And I can't wait for the sequel, great job devs.",03-22-2017

An incredible action/adventure game with light RPG elements.,"I've been gaming for over 30 years, and this is one of those rare games that I can't put down.  And when I do put it down, I'm looking forward to the next chance to play it again and pick up where I left off.

Amazing graphics whether you have a standard PS4 or PS4 Pro.  Running this on a Pro in 4K is breathtaking though.  I'm also a high end PC gamer, and Horizon Zero Dawn is frankly one of the most beautiful games that I've ever had the pleasure to play.  The 4K checkerboard technique used to deliver the visuals looks pretty stunning, so frankly, just enjoy the eyecandy and forget about the technical details.

The world itself comes alive.  Always something to explore, craft, trade, new mechanical beasts to discover and solve how to take down (adrenaline fueled combat puzzles), and NPCs that are fairly well done on top of that.  The combat is top notch to boot, and personally I found Aloy a compelling and engaging protagonist and her story arc is very well told.  The additional lore is also fairly interesting, if you choose to explore the nooks and crannies.

My favorite games from this gen are now officially the Witcher 3, and Horizon Zero Dawn.  Master classes in game design.

Aloy controls and handles really well, boasting strong animations and tight handles. Combat is very satisfying and robust. You have many different ways to take down foes, and them you. Each time you encounter a new beast you do have to analyze it's strengths and weaknesses, else you'll most likely lose (or retreat). Once you learn how to defeat an enemy, and once you get better equipment, the fights become a bit more routine ... but they are still fun, and still dangerous.

While the strength of the game is its gameplay, its weakness is the questing, characters, and story. While the story is entertaining from the stand point of being unique, it isn't told in a really grand or interesting way. The characters themselves (Aloy included) are very cliche (tribal dolts) and uninspired. Nothing truly stands out, and you often go to yourself, ""Who is this? Why do I care? Didn't I just see the same NPC elsewhere? What's his/her name? Does it matter?"" The questing is generic---nothing we haven't seen 100x over in other RPGs, MMORPGs, and quest-centric games before.

However, carried by strong and engaging gameplay and a beautiful world, the story is nonetheless decent. And the game offers a lengthy journey if you really want to complete everything or just feel like straight monster hunting.",03-22-2017

Not in quite some times have I been so anxious to find out the answers and so apprehensive to finish the game. Oh the dichotomy of wanting to finish the game, but at the same time wanting MORE!

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,4,Excellent Start,"This game deserves all the praise it is getting.  There are many reasons why you should buy this title now instead of waiting a year for a price drop.

First, the story, although not remarkable by any standard, is nevertheless rational.  The overall story arc is one of revenge or vengeance.  Alloy's drive makes sense, and her determination (which is principally fueled by a personal loss) is believable.  The voice acting isn't amazing.  It's good enough so that it does not distract from the gameplay.  In sum, the story and voice acting are above average and good.

Second, the graphics are excellent.  On the PS4 Pro, with HDR enabled and on a true 4K TV, the lighting effects and colors really impress.  At first I thought the world was simply one-toned: green bushes and trees surrounded by snow-capped mountains.  To my pleasant surprise, as you go from one large map area to another you begin to see significant climate changes.  You'll go from a forest setting to snowy mountains to desert to rough mountains, and a lot in between.  Each large city has its own culture and particular architecture.  For example, you see that Alloy's people are much more mystic and ""savage"" than other parts of the map.  Other large city-states may have huge cities and much larger populations.  You get the impression those areas are less mystic--which comes through quite well since when those people mention where Alloy comes from, they do so with some sarcasm.  Overall, the graphics and world are pretty well fleshed out.

Third, the gameplay is fun and addictive.  It's fun to use bow and arrows and ""primitive"" machine gun-type weapons against these giant, extremely powerful machines.  You must use cunning to take down an enemy that is significantly bigger, more power, and sometimes faster than you.  There are some instances where the gameplay gets repetitive.  However, I think the developers did a fairly good job varying the enemy types.  Is most RPG games the enemies are very one-note.  Here, you constantly discover new enemies, each with their own weaknesses and strengths.  You learn that what easily brought down one enemy type simply will not work for another.  You have to spend time scanning and watching and thinking of new ways to destroy different enemy types.

I think HZD is an excellent start to a new IP.  I'm looking forward to the next game, and hope the developers can build upon this.  The story could do with a reworking--Naughty Dog is superb with that, and there's no reason why HZD 2 couldn't follow suit.  HZD is also not a true RPG.  I think taking it that direction would be a great thing.  Having the ability to fully create, modify, and live as your own character in this rich world would make the replayability obvious.  HZD currently probably won't get much replay value because the character and traits simply aren't set up for that.

Go buy this game.  It's really that good.  It's fun, addictive, and different enough from all the other titles this year to justify the purchase.",03-19-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,"Amazing and unique, a must buy","The grand scale and uniqueness of this game is amazing and a breath of fresh air. Its an amalgamation of many different genres, but what makes it great is its awesome execution of its core features, and all other elements come together like a symphony. A future post-post-apocalyptic world where humanity is reduced to cave dwellers hunting giant dinosaur robots - how does it all come together? Beautifully!

Guerilla games, the creators of the Killzone series, has shooting mechanics down to a science (although I don't get why I cant adjust the aim sensitivity). I love that I get to play it any way I like: shooting, stealth, creating traps, possessing robots. While you can focus on certain gameplay routes, your character actually becomes adept at all aspects so you can pick and choose how you want to tackle your enemies, often using all of the above methods in one scenario. The gameplay is about hunting robots that respond with their own unique behaviors. I spooked a herd of grazers by running at them and when theyve taken-off to a safe distance, they turned around watching me. There are many moments in this game when the attention to detail took my breath away. Each robot has its own unique behaviors, weaknesses and strengths, and exploiting them is so much fun. I never tired from running on my way to a quest, only to stop and hunt. The side-quests are very engaging, often evolving into something unexpected (I liked the side-quests of Witcher 3, but this game beats even that).

Everything comes together in such a big way: the gameplay, the story, the sound effects, visual effects, animation, soundtrack and voice acting. The story does borrow elements from different genres, but I have yet to see a story that comes together like this. The way the story unfolds is scintillating and I kept wanting to know whats next. The protagonist, Aloy, feels like a complete human being. The way she reacts to situations is realistic  at first shes just a role-player trying to fit in, not really destined for anything, but by successfully overcoming obstacles one at a time and seeing the bigger vision, she becomes a world-changer. Some people have said the story is bland; I completely disagree. If you want a completely unique plot, then play Planescape: Torment. True, the plot isn't completely unique, but the way its told is unique and drives the narrative forward. It successfully tackles several big issues; pushing the idea that games can be art. I was skeptical at first since story-telling has never been Guerillas forte, but they really knocked it out of the park with this one.

Is it perfect? No, there are minor issues like inventory management, waypoint navigation in tight spaces, and I think it gets a bit sloppy at the very end. But these are minor weaknesses when compared to everything else it does well.

The protagonist is female, she is born into a matriarchal tribe, her role-model is a woman  and I loved every minute of it. She faces problems that I believe women face (Im a guy), from the way men constantly challenge her abilities to her feelings of isolation from being an orphan without a mother. In sci-fi movies and especially in games, the female lead is really nothing more than Marcus Fenix with long hair - a gum-chewing, butt-kicking male character with a female skin. Not so with Aloy, when shes challenged she takes it in stride, never backs down, and overcomes her doubt with foresight and determination, no to mention she always seems to have the right quip at the right time. Finally, we have a positive and relatable female lead in a game.

Buy this game now. If you like shooters, or storytelling, or RPGs, or action, or strategy  go buy it. If you don't have a PS4, save up and buy it. This game doesnt just execute a bunch of features well, its its own unique entity, and I think this is why some game reviewers have a hard time defining it  it all comes together to form something new.",03-19-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,One of the best PS4 games.,"I just passed this game and can see it is definitely one of the most ambitious and an amazing game to play.  I was at first not sure how a game like this would work, but it works on so many levels.  The open world is just amazing to look at.  The character animations, cinema scenes and voice acting are just awesome.  The game does take some liberties from other games.  Some of it reminds me of Witcher 3, Uncharted or Tomb Raider.  It has the climbing of Nathan Drake, or the arrow shooting like Tomb Raider.  It has the side quest to build up your experience levels and also has a device that can track footprints just like in Witcher 3.  This game never gets too frustrating and the side quests are actually fun to do.  It's an amazing game with a great story.  I hope there is a sequel and would definitely recommend any PS4 owner to go out and buy this.",03-19-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,A beautiful open world to explore with fun mysteries,"The game hooks you in with its very detailed and interesting open world and beautiful HDR infused graphics, but it's the story that ultimately keeps you wanting to explore the mysteries the game provides. Exploration is thus very fun not only because you want to hunt for that next item for an upgrade, but you also want to discover more about the history of this world to see how things went so wrong. It's not as deep as Witcher 3 or Fallout 4 but it still provides a very rich and rewarding open world RPG experience. The production values are top notch and the combat is very fun with a fair amount of room for freedom of play style. The story isn't terribly long but all the exploring and side quests make up for that. I highly recommend the game as a fun experience and also a visual show piece for the PS4 pro. On my LG OLED tv this game looks amazing!",03-19-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Terrablast your way through perfection,"Fairly often, games come out and they are touted as ""the best this or the best that ever"" and ultimately they end up being just slightly better versions of something else or super over ratted once the dust settles.  Even from the very first E3 glimpses, I had this really great feeling about Horizon, long before the hype train took off.  There was just something so unique about what I was seeing in the footage that prompted me to pre-order the game, something I haven't done since being completely burned by doing so with Metroid Other M for the Wii.

  Even before the game shipped, critics were praising Horizon to the heavens and the five star reviews were pouring in from all over on Amazon.  Ignoring the hyperbolic gushing praise, I received the game and started it for myself without paying much attention to the runaway hype train.  What I found was something not only worthy of the heaps of praise it had been getting, but something that far surpassed my own lofty expectations.  Horizon Zero dawn is nothing short of a master piece of game design.  It's a time capsule we'll look back on and remember how it changed gaming forever.  It's a technical achievement like no other and that includes the technical marvel that is Uncharted 4.  Horizon far surpasses anything else that's come to the Playstation swiftly and without a doubt.  Every single facet of this game, every nook and cranny of this giant world to explore is perfectly realized.  It is absolutely astounding the attention to detail this game has.  It is also polished to the Nth degree.  In no time during my play through did I find glitches or annoying problems that seem to be a staple in shipped games this generation.  Despite putting almost 90 hours into the game, I never once felt overwhelmed or got ""gamer's fatigue"".  I was just having so much fun in this world, there was no rush to leave it.

  As the game progressed and I got a thrill every time I faced a brand new machine or completed a new cauldron area or interesting side-mission, I kept thinking as the end loomed nearer and nearer, that please oh please dear gaming gods-let them stick the landing.  Let this game give me a satisfying conclusion to the very intriguing and complex story that has so cleverly unfolded throughout my play through.  I am happy to report that for me, they absolutely stuck the landing and gave me a final mission where I felt that the final threat had indeed descended upon me, and it was up to me to save man-kind.  I literally completed the game 20 minutes before writing this review and I am still coming down from the high.

  What I like perhaps most about Horizon is that it's a ""fair"" game.  It is challenging, quite challenging in fact in certain areas, but it's always fair.  When a monster kicks your rear-end and you die, you realize it was because of something you didn't do right, not because of manufactured difficulty on the developer's part.  Maybe you need to tweak your weapon's mods.  Maybe you need to Terrablast a certain troublesome machine part before you nail the machine with rounds and rounds of fire arrows.

  There are a lot of challenging bits to Horizon, but they are always satisfying and you leave you frustrated.  Even if I did VERY RARELY get frustrated because I couldn't find a way up the mountain or something else, I had a problem holding it against the game.  It was always something that was there right in front of me and I just missed it.  Oh and Aloy.  How can you not like Aloy?  She's a sassy girl when she needs to be, but level headed and determined.  She's pretty much instantly likable once you take control.  I don't know how many times her responses to certain NPC's made me smile or chuckle.  She'd be a great girl to hang out with.  She's also a joy to control as she moves fluidly and perfectly as directed.

  To summarize my thoughts on Horizon, if you are sitting the fence on this one-it's a no brainer.  Anyone who could find fault in this masterpiece is really, really, REALLY nit picking.  This game is polished to a fine shine and I think it's probably going to ruin some other games for me going forward by comparison.  All I can say is that the already great new Tomb Raider series and the Farcry series to which Horizon takes the most inspiration from are going to have to raise their A game for their next installments because they've been trumped in every way possible.  This game also takes inspiration from Uncharted, a tiny bit from Assassin's Creed and even the Arkham games but these bits are not blatant and serve to do similar things in the most optimal ways they've been done to date.

  Make no mistake about Horizon Zero Dawn-this is a system seller if ever there was one.  If you don't have a PS4 already, now is a great time to get one.  Get your PS4 for Horizon and stick around for Uncharted 4 and the Uncharted Collection, The Last of us Remastered & Ratchet and Clank.  It took PS4 a while for me personally to achieve greatness, but it has now officially arrived.

The graphics are the best I have played on PS4 to date. The sfx/music/voice work is top notch. The world in this game is all consuming and exploration is thoroughly rewarded. The stealth mechanic is an appreciated element and the controls feel very tight. Above all else, this is the first game I have played with a strong female character that isn't modeled as a physical sex object by the developers.

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,3,"It's Okay Game, But Highly Gender Bias Against Men","This is a ""okay"" game and nothing more... The only good thing it has going for it is it's graphics.
The game is super easy... I played on Very Hard on the first go and found no challenge at all... I never ran low on supplies or felt I should be worried.
Top of that... The games AI is REALLY dumb.. I took down a whole group of bandits in one spot and took down a pack of robots with making the loudest sounds ever and not one heard me... but I won't lie it felt good every time I took down a robot no matter how easy it was.

Next the story was great on the first half but the other half was boring and dumb.
I like the reason why, but I didn't like the how.

Aloy was a very cool character and I enjoy seeing more woman as the main protagonist in a game.
but I do feel Aloy came off a bit plain and lacked something to make me care about her. :/

The RPG and skill tree is very limited and there were some skills that seem pointless and wonder why I had to spend my points on this?
as well the equipment is very limited and most of them are not needed. :/

Lastly is the biggest one... The game hugely gender bias against Men.
90% of Men fall under 3 things
*He's a Killer, Jerk, Thief
*He's a hopeless bum and can't do anything without a woman
*He's weaker man. aka (a gatherer not a hunter)

90% of woman fall under 2 things
*She is in power and is the leader
*She is the victim of a man

I have nothing against woman or woman being in power... but I disliked how this game made it seem like Men can't do anything right and woman have to be the ones to clean up after the mess.
I played the whole game was hoping the game would disprove how I felt, but it didn't, only added more to it.
I don't want to do spoilers and go in more reason why it's gender bias against Men... but the game clearly is bias and I dislike how that it's being ignored.

I just hope the next game can be more fair and show both men and woman can do great things and can be a strong independent person... and both genders can be mean and evil and do really foolish things

It's a 3 star game easily or a 7 out of 10.",03-18-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Could have been elite,"Could have been an elite game (ie. ranking with the very best ever made for the PS3 / PS4, which IMO include Red Dead Redemption,
Grand Theft Auto V, Uncharted 4 and Witcher 3). Only a couple of things held it back:

Pros:
+ Huge, gorgeous open world that is fun to explore
+ Great main storyline
+ Side Quests 50 / 50. Some are typical grind fests, but some are actually quite good
+ Combat is so much fun, due to the variety of opponents (eg. cultists, bandits, small dinobots, big dinobots, colossal dinobots)
+ Great gameplay that feature elements of Far Cry, Tomb Raider, Uncharted and Witcher 3
+ Boss fights are extremely challenging, not quite Dark Souls level difficulty, but not far off

Cons:
- Skill tree is weak. Only 36 skills, none of which are upgradeable (contrast this with another popular RPG, Fallout 4, which has
  70 skills, most of which are upgradeable).
- Weapon / Armor/ Loot selection is very weak. Devs should have made much bigger array of weapons and loot available, not unlike
  Witcher 3

Honestly, if they had given the main character a decent skill tree, and a decent selection of weapons and loot, this game would be a instant classic.
As it is, it is tremendous fun to play, and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10 stars.",03-18-2017

The concept for this game is interesting and fun.  Comparatively to Witcher 3 not as much time sunk into this game, but for some the Witcher was, I think, a bit overwhelming in the amount of content.

I think I've seen people complaining about bad camera angles and I did experience this occasionally when a big machine was practically on top of me, but I felt it was nothing compared to how awful Final Fantasy XV's was in practically every combat situation.

The crafting systems were meh to me... I like to gather recipes and materials to create new, advanced gear.  This game had none of that.  In a way it was kinda nice to not have to spend forever gathering and what have you, what you do craft you can complete all of pretty quickly and early on in the game.  I like to feel like I'm being rewarded though, for sinking that much time into gathering.  You aren't really rewarded with any OP kinds of gear till practically the end of them game (hint: the power cells are worth finding!), but this reward comes so late in the game it's a bit of a bummer.  Hopefully they'll make an expansion or two for me to use this gear on.

I liked the main character and found her to be a decent person which is pretty unusual for most video games.  It was refreshing for her to not be some spoiled brat or some huge d-bag.  But really, the amount of real RP is limited to maybe 15-20 interactions in the whole game and that's probably a high guesstimate.

Visually this game is stunning.  The ruins are wonderful to explore and the views are breathtaking.  However, the emotions and facial movements on characters in cut scenes is bizarre and freaky to look at at times.  There is literally so much eyebrow movement in some of these characters reactions it's uncanny.  Still none of this changed the fact that the game was fun to play and had a great plot that didn't let me down.

I felt like the combat and armor left multiple ways to play through combat, my personal approach was to hide and lay traps and tripwires for my enemies.  Great technique to use, works pretty well (and is easy) except for flying machines and the human enemies.  There are definitely pathing issues for even the slightly bigger enemies.  Won't lie... totally exploited this when I had an opportunity to early on in the game.  As someone who generally doesn't excel at shooters it was pretty easy to get the hang of the bow and arrow, especially after purchasing a few skill points.  I liked the way the skill tree was laid out and that way before completing the main plot I was able to collect all skills.  Note that some are more helpful than others, the majority felt useful.

As I said, the quantity of side quests is limited, especially compared to Dragon Age: Inquisition and the Witcher 3, but was similar in quality of plot and game play to me.  This game was of a much higher caliber than FFXV was and coming from an indie studio, I think it was a great success.

A note on pre-ordering from Amazon: due to strong storms in my area this game was delivered to me a day late.  I was unwilling to wait that much time to play this game and when I figured out it wasn't going to arrive the day of release I immediately purchased and downloaded from PSN.  I will not make the same mistake pre-ordering a game I'm excited for again.  It was a horrible disappointment.  I know that this was of no fault from Amazon (they can't control the weather yet), but as I said... I'll just go the digital route from here on out.",03-14-2017

The second go through, seemed a bit easier, since I'd of course, become much more adept at using the weapons and knowing the best strategies to defeat even the most powerful robot animals. But i uncovered side stories i hadnt explored the first run, so the game was even richer and rewarding. There are just a few games over the years that i played several times, but this mind blowing game has become my favorite. Cannot recommend it highly enough if you love franchises like, Dishonored. Tomb Raider, Bioshock and Uncharted.

Original review:  Very rarely, a game comes along that sets a completely new standard in immersive entertainment.  Horizon Zero Dawn certainly borrows from the best that came before it, but the developers at Guerrilla Games have combined brilliant elements of extreme creativity, eye candy graphics, a story line thats completely fantastic but bizzarely believable considering developments in AI and Robotics. Game play and controls are fluid and intuitive, despite being somewhat complex, as to weapon enhancements and skill evolution as you progress.  The social structures and relationships that exist in this post apoctolyptic world are  believable as well, as society has devolved into tribal units that are matriarchal and include social practices like casting out members of society and shunning them for various offenses.  The main character, Aloy, a great name in this post-age the tribal leaders called the Metal World, that is terrorized by  a growing cast of robotic machines now operating in a feral existence, is one such outcast who was cared for and later trained by another outcast, a warrior named Rost. You see their angst as they are shunned and belittled any time they come in contact with the established tribal members in the story lines beginning, but especially the frustration of Aloy as an innocent child trying to understand why she is different and not accepted.  Ironicallly, many younger players might relate to that socal stigma if they're part of the complicated social strata that exist in western culture adolescence.  A periodic competition exists that allows young tribal members to become braves but also allows an outcast to prove their metel, wherein, if they finish, are allowed to become a brave and shed the social stigma as they will now help defend their tribe. Fittingly the competition is called, The Proving. The deity that permeates the cultures spiritual beliefs is curiously also referred to in phrases that incorporate the word Mother making it female as their life giver and sustainer. There are, of course, quests that must be accomplished, but to me they seem less structured and predictible as many other games Ive played.  There periodically exists social interractions where Aloy is given the opportunity to respond in a variety of ways which you can choose.  Your choices of her responses will help determine how her character develops and how she is regarded.  As for the mechanical creatures you encounter and whose diversity is gradually revealed as you progress, they are nothing short of epic and mesmerizing with movements that are reminescent of the dinosaurs that roamed the earth eons ago. Completely unique in size, function, defense capabilities and ferosity, you initially approach them timidly, as any of them can easily kill you and learn their weaknesses and vulnerabilities in order to bring them down. You also acquire the ability to transform them to be docile and even an ally in limited ways.  One early creature, for example, is called a Watcher, and resembles perhaps, a raptor in size and movements, whose purpose is mainly to observe so their head is dominated by a lens eye.  When they detect you, a question mark appears over their heads and they will approach. If they spot you the eye turns red and the entire screen takes on a milky hue, indicating you are being scanned and under attack. Aloy found a small earpiece that attaches too her head, one day as a child accidentally, when she falls into an abandoned underground cavern that contains remnants of the wrecked Metal World age.  The device gives her a heads up scanning projection of the area around her, revealing useful hidden information, items and vulnerabilities.  Ive been playing for hours and see Im only 20% into the game, despite learning and accomplishing volumes.  The game has some elements that really make the experience seem so believable and realistic.  Besides the changing light as the day progresses, at times there will be flash rain or snow showers which change the visibility and game play.  Youre able to do periodic game saves when you locate a  camp fire, well, a stack of wood which  you light and then do a quick save or a manuel save.  Its a good idea, after youve accomplished a particularly challenging sequence or defeated one or a herd of very tough machines, to return to do a save.  Its not always close to your scene of action, but on the PS4 at least, you can push a button to bring up a map section and then quick travel there.  One feature that may not be important to some gamers but to me its what makes the game even more involving and emersive, is the character development and the social complexity. Add to that the excellent voice acting.  I waited to buy my PS4 Pro especially for the game Dishonored 2, and as fantastic as that game was in many ways, I felt very disappointed in the character development and lack luster voice acting which made much of it seem suprisingly flat, despite the spectacular graphics.  Not so here. Guerrilla seems to have ticked all the boxes in every category. I would prefer to be balanced by listing a few things that seemed weaker, but honestly, I cant think of any.  This has become my new standard and all time favorite.  The price will be reduced after another month or so. I paid full price to have it on its release date and have Zero regrets.  If you enjoy games like Tomb Raider and Uncharted youll be mesmerized by Zero Dawn Horizon. Your main weapons are a lance and a bow which you can acquire specialized ammo for depending on the type of battle you're up for.  To maintain your health, you are alerted to medicinal plants that you can pick and store in your medicine pouch till you need them. The scenery is absolutely spectacular, sometimes rugged mountain terrain or lush green forests and a pair or a herd of mechanical animals can appear around any bend, to be attacked and disabled or just avoided.  Sorry for the long description but this game is really, incredibly beautiful, challenging and captivating. Do not hesitate to purchase it now or wait a few weeks and it should be reduced 20% or so as is the custom. Beyond a 5 star rating to me.",03-12-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Five Stars,great game,03-12-2017
https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Dressed in Perfection!,"This game brings several important features and elements from other known games like MGSV, Tomb Raider, Witcher 3 (and whatever else I forgot) and puts the *best* combinations together to give you the ultimate challenge against the machines. The craziness doesn't start in the beginning, but it's from that first Watcher you go up against and your mouth drops ""Holy freaking hell!"" As you progress, the machines get harder to kill, you notice they wear different types of armor and they acquire new skills, some are instant-burst damage that is hard to avoid.

There is NO tutorial, as noted by Guerilla Games, they want you to experience things first-hand and learn through trial-and-error. I didn't agree with it at first, but yeah this was stupid awesome. Learning to control Aloy feels as if you are part of her. The experience is overwhelming all together.

You will hear negatives about the game, if it's about controls or gameplay or combat - ignore them. This is a real configured new IP that takes from the best and puts it together into a serious perfection. The pros outdo the cons - like the bad lip sycning on secondary characters or some of the lame side-quests. Let alone, the main storyline *is* awesome. Whenever you progress through the storyline, you begin to wonder, ""What happened long ago?"" Exactly what happened long ago ... you begin to uncover the past slowly as you learn about the current world. The environment is so skillfully done through professionals that study the worlds and highlight how nature and man-made materials decay overtime.

The graphics are stunning ... The graphics ... are stunning. They're super gorgeous, especially if you have a 1080p with HDR capabilities. This game represents what real colors would look like in HDR TVs (and soon in Monitors later this year). I've paused so many times looking at the beauty of the game. There are so many cliffs where I had Aloy kneel and looked at the beauty of the game, I took pictures using the Photo Mode that Guerilla Games implemented (it's super amazing). The audio is astonishing, perfect scores, exciting combat, soothing music when you're walking through and gazing at humanity's fall.

Here are the features of this game, unbaised:

Pros
+Graphics
+Controls (Aloy)
++Combat
+Audio
+Gear
+Main Quest(s)
+No bugs, crashes were all patched within few days (have never crashed) Open worlds tend to have bugs, like the infamous Witcher 3 (my god ...) But Horizon annihilates all of that.
+Gigantic open world with many things to do, many side-quests, many errands, challenges, item collections, etc. (60+ Hours in, 70% completion, haven't touched the final quest yet as I tend to get everything before I hit it - Considering the depth and structure of the main quest, I already know the climax is going to be just as great)
+Aloy is a character you *need* to learn how to control, there is no holding-hands in this game, especially with her ranged attacks (bows mostly, she has different types of bows). This game will begin to get harder as you progress. Enemies won't wait for you, they will attack you all at the same time or one after another - pausing or trying to stay-still to shoot will get you killed, you can move and shot at the same time, sometimes while combating machines others will attack you from the side or sneak from behind you.

Cons:
-Some lame side-quests
-Most of the side-quests are repetitive, but different stories
-Bad lip-syncing on secondary characters
-No word on DLC, yet? :/ ....
-Purchasing Resources is a pain ...

What can be improved:
*Fix the lip-syncing
*Restructure gear - bows and weapons - to include an experience-system with passives, provide new bows, recolor few, attachments, randomized stats
*Introduced trinket-like type of gear to give an extra ability or something nefty to Aloy
*Playing on Very Hard is actually very hard, but the enemies don't scale with your level which makes Aloy a little stronger than the machines once the player acquires end-game modifiers, end-game weapons and especially her best-in-slot armor.
*Introduced World Quests (from WoW: Legion) to be delivered on daily basis with challenges and harder machines to fight - machines should have more variety and randomized skill-sets as well.
*Expand the world further, introduce new machines, introduce new side-quests, explore Horizon's history more

Tips for everyone:
*The bags don't need to be expanded, you're carrying a lot of things you don't need. I'm not talking about the resources that you use to create ammo or potions or bombs, etc. I'm talking about the *other* things that you carry to create stuff.
*Kill as many wild animals as you can in the beginning! They are the key to expand your bags.
*Go for a lot of resources and more items drop, then work your way towards ""removing modifiers."" The only other ability you would really need is the first Concentration, you can work on the other skills later.
*Do side-quests, some of them will apply to the final quest. Any secondary-main quests should be completed right away. The main quest can wait.
*Research on how to acquire Aloy's best-in-slot armor before you do main-quests, it is a pain to go back and do the things you need to do to unlock it. I did everything in one-shot luckily.

That's is all. Verdict for this game is 7 out of 5 for me.",03-11-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Amazing new IP,"Last night I finished Horizon. 97+ hours over the course of 9 days (I'm currently out of work and have lots of time on my hands,) and I enjoyed virtually every minute of it. It's my favorite new IP since 2008's Dead Space. They're kind of similar now that I think about it; In both cases, rather than be extremely innovative they took a well established sub-genre (DS being survival horror and Horizon being open world RPG,) gave it a non-traditional sci-fi motif, and polished it up to near perfection. I normally don't go for games like this, e.g. Elder Scrolls or The Witcher etc. but this game won me over easily. I've always had a taste for post-apocalyptic, especially when the nature of the apocalypse in question is an unknown mystery that gets solved towards the end of the story. After wondering about it for almost two years, finally finding out what ""Zero Dawn"" means was a great moment. Horizon's backstory sort of reminds me of Xenogears, in a very loose way. Nowhere near as epic and complex, but similar themes. The combat is rich creamery butter- not too tough, not too easy... on normal mode. Lots of great characters, Aloy in particular of course. I had no idea she was going to be so sarcastic and snarky, I love it. Bit of a Mary Sue, but within tolerable limits. She isn't the only one, though. If I had to call out a flaw, it would be that the writer wasn't particularly subtle with their agenda, which caters to a certain demographic; With very few exceptions, the female characters in the story are supremely upstanding, capable, heroic. While on the other hand the male characters tend to be deeply flawed and do nothing to hide it. They're greedy and manipulative, or they're bumbling drunkards, cruel sociopaths, or murderous psychopaths... Again, while this might have caused to roll my eyes occasionally, it never got in the way of my enjoyment. I always expected Horizon to be a good game, as I've been a fan of Guerrilla since Killzone 1 in 2004, but I didn't expect them to hit it out of the park to this degree. I've played tons of great games over the last 10 years, but this one is a true standout. I'll be replaying this many times in the coming years, until the inevitable sequel.",03-10-2017

I just can't say amazing enough to describe it.  I was hoping it would be good, but it was much better than I expected.  It's like Far Cry, The Witcher 3, and Assassin's Creed had a near perfect baby together.  There are elements of all the games here, but not so much from any one game that it's just copying it.  There's action, stealth, a little bit of RPG, a little bit of crafting, and whole lot of robots.",03-09-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,I haven't been sucked into a PS4 game like this since The Last of Us Remastered,"From the moment you start playing Horizon Zero Dawn, a few things become abundantly clear: 1, the controls and way Aloy handles feel very familiar to fans of the genre, in a good way... much easier to get a handle on than say, the Witcher III. 2, the combat system is simple to understand but difficult to master. 3, you'll find yourself stopping to say ""wow"" in many areas... the graphics and art direction in this game are phenomenal. 4, Despite the familiar feel, the new characters and incredibly unique environment, story and creatures will make you want to discover everything this game has to offer.

This is my favorite game of 2017 so far, hands down. The combat is very tense, and the animal like machines are diverse and interesting in the variety of ways they move and attack. It feels like you could attack a herd in 10 different ways using the variety of ranged weapons, traps and melee attacks at your disposal. There is a clear advantage to being stealthy, but Aloy is plenty capable with machines charging her head on as well. Some of the larger battles against larger machines will definitely get your heart rate up.

The story is pretty interesting and the side quests are somewhat varied. Excellent music and decent voiceovers. You definitely feel like you want to learn the entire story more-so than a lot of open world games.

All I have to conclude is that if you own a PS4 and are looking for an adventure to lose yourself in, this game is a must-own.

6 MONTH UPDATE: I still pop this game in from time to time. After you finish the main story, which took me a little over 32 hours, you can go back and do as many side quests or whatever else you want to spend your time doing. You can also start the game over again but keep all of your progress from your first play through!! I'm planning on doing that next to tide me over to the Frozen Wilds DLC later this year.",03-09-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,3,"A beautiful game, but tedious gameplay","I really wanted to like this game, but so far I find it lacking.  It's a beautiful game, maybe the prettiest game I've seen in quite some time and it shows off the power of the PS4 nicely.  I've read some complaints about character animation, but it all looks pretty flawless to me.  The problem is in the open world setting.  I think we've reached the point where more isn't necessarily better and what's the point of having a huge open world when there's so little to do in it.  Gathering resources and crafting items has been proven to be 100% boring in every game I've come across. What's worse is it's mandatory in this game - you have to craft your ammunition and gather flowers to refill your health bar.  Hold me down from the excitement!

I also find the game to be unbalanced.  There's a point early on when you're released into the open world where your character is severely underpowered.  Since you're walking great distances you frequently come across larger and larger robotic foes which can swarm you leading to a relatively quick death.  It makes exploring the world not much fun.

The moment to moment game play reminds me a lot of the rebooted Tomb Raider games and maybe the developers should have taken more clues from that franchise.  Give your players the freedom to explore, but not much much freedom that it devolves into tediousness.",03-08-2017

Graphics look good, but wouldn't call it amazing.","TLDR: Game play is similar to Witcher 3, looks like Tomb Raider with better lighting, climbs and moves like Uncharted, and NPC interaction like Fallout

I haven't beaten the game yet and I'm playing it on a regular PS4 on a 4k TV. I know this game is also designed to utilize the PS4 Pro 4k boost.

The game is quite fun despite me not liking RPG style games. Overall the game is very similar to Witcher 3 without all the complex controls. What I didn't like about Witcher 3 on the PS4 was that there was so many complex buttons to do things, that it created a huge learning curve to play the game. In Horizon, the learning curve isn't as big and is similar to the Uncharted or Tomb Raider controls. The climbing mechanism in game is also similar to Tomb Raider and Uncharted. Interaction with NPCs is similar to Fallout or other Bethesda RPG games. Visually I don't think it's as amazing as some people mentioned in the review. But you can tell it is quite nice with the lighting and 3D Tessellation of their hair similar to the newer Tomb Raiders. Their movements while they idle and cut scenes reminds me of when you talk to NPCs in Bioshock. Very unnatural movement and look as if they are puppet and there is a ventriloquist moving them around.

Story revolves around your character, Aloy, who was shunned from birth by her tribe. The time frame is somewhere in the distant future, when human technology had reverted back to the stone age era, because of war and the development of machines. The characters wear Nordic and Germanic style clothing similar to those you see in movies talking about the time when Vikings invade or when Rome was attacked by Barbarians. In this future world, women are actually those who hold position of power. I believe the game was made with a feminist political agenda, because the main character is a girl and the cultural structure is a Matriarchy (opposite of a patriarchy). It doesn't really bother me. The story isn't that amazing, more like a background kind of thing. More interested in the gameplay.

Overall, good game, would recommend to those trying to break into RPG style games or those who like Tomb Raider Reboot.",03-08-2017

I was worried due to the bow and arrow always being my weakest weapon in any game, but that hasn't been the case in this one. I also am enjoying the narrative. Not Citizen Kane but not a Michale Bay movie either. I guess what I'm trying to say the most is that this game does everything right, even if it hasn't done anything particularly ground breaking.

As much as I enjoy stat tweaking and leveling, I cannot remember a game whose character upkeep felt as tedious. When the awe of your surroundings fades shortly in, you're ability to appreciate new environments is hindered by the horribly cluttered UI.  The intuitive focus mode only clouds the screen even more with more data than one should have to pay attention to.  You get used to all this after while, but the gameplay never feels as seamless as that of Rise of the Tomb Raider, which is an example of a superb action game with similar chatacter and weapon tweaking.  Lara also skies over Aloy when it comes to facial expression that allows you to feel what the character is feeling.  Aloy is a good character, but her superb voice acting rarely fits with her lack of expression.  I've spent a good number of hours with the game so far and can see myself quitting before too much longer.  The game has just failed to make me become as engrossed in it as I anticipated.

This game takes allot of ideas from other games, such as Uncharted and Far Cry, but I don't think the creators had it in mind to create something completely new to the Open-World genre, but rather they had this idea for a Setting, Story, and Characters in mind first and then create a well made and functional game around.

Definitely worth your time.,"I haven't finished the game yet, so I'll edit the score (if I change my mind), when I do. So far, I'm really enjoying the game. It looks outstanding. The character models look eerily real, and the design work on the machines, is amazing. The world is large and varied, with snowy landscapes, and grassy plains. The controls aren't perfect, but they're better than most. You have 2 close melee attacks, which work well, but this isn't Devil May Cry. It's fun and gets the job done. The weapons is where combat shines. The standard bow and arrow works great, and is a ton of fun, and you also purchase different weapons and traps that allow you to take on enemies in a bunch of varied ways. The mission structure and character interactions are very similar to the Witcher 3, which is fine, considering that's one of the best games I've played in a very long time. Best thing I can say, if you've seen videos, and you think it looks fun, buy it. You will enjoy it.",03-04-2017

A must for PS4 Pro owners.","This game is unbelievably good. The lighting is the best I've seen. The shadow Aloy casts is so realistic that I can't remember seeing anything like it before. When your in a forest, the way the light filters through the trees is amazing. Watching the sun set/rise while looking out over an area from a mountain top, is something I never get tired of. The story and world is well thought out and realized. And amazingly detailed. Which outfit Aloy is wearing has an effect on how random npc's respond to you. Your actions also effect how your talked about. Example would be, after you ride a machine and your seen you start being referred to as machine rider and only after your seem doing it. The combat is a hybrid of tomb raider for the projectile weapons, and dark souls melee (right shoulder buttons are light and hard and combat roll with circle button). You save respawn and fast travel with campfires that are basically bonfires. The different areas are unique and interwoven with each other. The rpg element is reminiscent of shadow of mordor and tomb raider with you unlocking abilities with skill point trees. The weather system is dynamic and beautify rendered. From snow on a mountain side turning into rain as you descend, or seeing a dust storm rolling in from the distance until your inside it. When you fight a new enemy type for the first time you feel a real sense of peril. Like the dark souls series if you see a ruin or structure in the distance you can get to it and explore. If you are a fan of detailed and well thought out open world games I highly recommend getting this game. This is the first major release to be PS4 Pro enhanced at launch I would recommend having a Pro to get the full experience.",03-04-2017

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,Very Special,"I shouldnt be reviewing the game yet because Im not very far into it, but I cant help myself.  To preface, I usually hate open world games.  I actually prefer a game to be linear and have a firm beginning and end.  My patience with games is thin and I can get bored very easily, hence making open world games not my cup of tea.  I would even be willing to call myself picky. Usually whenever I play an open world game I feel like quality was sacrificed for quantity.  Whether it is the graphics or just how fun the game is, I always feel like everything is put 2nd place to the longevity.  A good analogy is say a lot of food that is bland to less food that tastes amazing.  Good examples are The Last Of Us, Uncharted and God Of War series, these are all linear and are all (with some exceptions) masterpieces.  IMHO open world games cannot compete with games like that, but I digress.  My point is with Horizon it doesnt have the feel of an open world game, the graphics and gameplay feel more like a fun, solid and polished linear game.  Taking down the machines is just so satisfying with their sparking and smoking out.  Even little things are awesome like your healing resources bar underneath your health bar, showing you exactly how much you can heal relative to how much you need.  Its games like this that make me hate that games are released in the middle of the work week.  Also, as a rule I like RPGs, but sometimes I either don't like level grinding or feel like the game is expecting you to do it too much.  I can already feel like Ill have fun level grinding in Horizon because the combat is fun.  This game is very unique, it basically pulls off qualities that I don't usually like in other games.",03-03-2017

This information is for the hard case version.

Installation information:
Came as a DVD (blue-ray) which is used to installed to the Hard Drive
Requires 42 GB of space
Will install and run in offline mode (no Internet connection required)
There is a 244 MB update if you go online which takes the game to version 1.02. It will play without the update.
It took 17 minutes for it to install.

Game information:
single player - No multiplayer at this time
Played for about 4 hours with no errors
Great graphics
Reminds me of a Tomb Raider and Fay Cry type of game play and interface.
Is open world play.
Saves are done at camps which are located thought the maps.
You play as a female character

When I got the game I installed in offline mode. Installation went without any problems and started the game in about 17 minutes. I continued to play the game for about 3 hours.

The game is gorgeous even on a PS4, the gameplay is superb and probably some of the best mechanics I have ever experienced.

I did preorder this game from Amazon and I didn't receive it when it came out but the day after. I feel like that's an amazon issue not an issue win the game or publisher. Therefore I'm rating on gameplay and game experiences.

Yes, the first few house are story driven and might be slow paced but once you get out of mother land and into the wild. This is truly where the game excels on all fronts. The graphics are bright, vibrant, and jaut overall gorgeous. The look and feel of Aloy is supurb. He robotic dinosaurs are always great and you feel great killing one (especially bigger ones).

I hope this review helped and I hope you pick it up and support the team that brought us the Killzone series for years and years. This is their new IP and I couldn't be happier.",03-02-2017

It's truly a real AAA achievement, everybody knows that. It is beautiful, open world, solid combat, etc. But much like uncharted 4, I'm just not feeling it that much. I'm not feeling compelled to play it the way I am with Nioh or FF15 for example. Just not as fun for me. The story and characters don't do much for me.

And I'm really not loving the camera/controls. Close up action feels loose and un-intuitive.

First off, the one negative thing I can say is actually about amazon.  I have had this preordered for months, and it showed up a day after release despite me selecting day-of shipping.  I even got notifications saying it was ""out for delivery"" and then it didn't show up until almost 24 hours later.  Ultimately not a huge deal but a big annoyance.

Onto the game:

GORGEOUS graphics
Really engaging characters
The social society of the nora and the other tribes is really interesting
The controls are easy to learn and pretty intuitive.
The combination of technology/metal and nature is really interesting.
The story is engaging right from the start.

The game is huge.  I'm not even 5% done after more than 5 hours of play.  I would recommend this to anyone even remotely interested in games.

Regular PS4 version is just leaving me speechless.

- Amazing intro with amazing music
- Best graphics I've ever seen in my life, and I'm coming off of Uncharted 4. Runs at native 1080p on regular PS4.
- Beautiful story. I won't detail this to prevent spoilers
- Perfect 30fps locked. Not noticing any stutter or slowdown at all. The frame pacing is flawless
- Beautiful animations
- The most unique main character I've seen in years
-  Main character doesn't look like some stupid, out of place supermodel
- Amazing physics on clothing and hair
- Very good voice acting
- Probably the best soundtrack of 2017
- MASSIVE, busy open world, which doesn't even impact the frame rate. I don't understand how Guerrilla pulled that off. It's smooth everywhere. It's insane.

https://www.amazon.com/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-PlayStation-4/dp/B00ZQC73O8?th=1,8,Video Games,Horizon Zero Dawn - PlayStation 4,4.7,5,An Epic Adventure of a life time.,"Horizon Zero Dawn is simply a game of epic evolution. The joy of watching your character grow up and become a hero in a world at war is an amazing feeling.

This game brings a tear to my eyes often with an amazing story. Watching your character go from child to adult is like watching your own life in a game.

The combat is amazing like ""Mad Max"" the game if you played that last year. The fighting system feels flawless and easy to control.

The crafting system is simple and easy to use with a vast amount of choices.

The fact that I can't put this game down and drag myself to bed at night shows that so much love and hard work was put into this game. I rarely ever finish a game anymore, but I can tell this one is going be to 100% completed.

Sadly I am not able to play this game in 4k, but I can tell you that the 2k graphics are the best I have ever seen.

While I cannot say enough good things about this game, my only complaint is the waypoint system. It often seems you set a waypoint and the target for the waypoint seems to bounce around, even if you are walking straight towards it. Hope this is something that gets resolved, but NOT a deal break by any standard.

YES this game is worth the full price of admission. I will even support all add on's that come out for this game. That is something I rarely do.

This game has my vote for Game of the Year.

NOW GO BUY IT!",02-28-2017

The Gameplay? Perfect. If you played the other smash bros. and enjoyed them. You will love this. I've been playing this for two straight hours and man is it perfect. Smash Bros wherever you want to go! Ever since they took down the Wii internet play on brawl I haven't played this game with friends. Until now!

Also I have been a Megaman fan my entire life and to put him in a Smash Bros. game. Beautiful!

They brought back Stadium. So have fun smashing targets! Slamming home runs! Classic, All star, Training, and a new thing called smash run were you have 5 minutes to beat a set of enemies.

You can create a custom Mii to fight as well. So Montmorillonite's Mii has finally been put to work since Wii sports!

I highly recommend this game. It's hard to take time to write the review! I just want to keep playing! Oh and Pacman is freaking unbeatable.

6 stars. If you have a 3ds. BUY IT. If you don't. BUY A 3DS AND THIS!!!!! Sorry for exclamation and caps.

After a couple of weeks to break it in the game keeps showing me new things. Like unlockable moves for characters.

https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,4,Smashing in the Palm of Your Hand,"Since 1999, Super Smash Bros. has been one of Nintendo's Premiere franchises.  The addictive multiplayer aspect alone has kept people running back to Smash time and time again.  To this day people still play the original, Melee and Brawl seriously, as though they were just released within the past year.  The games are addictive and fun, but also offer a variety of modes if you find yourself going at it by yourself.  Super Smash Brothers on the 3DS marks the first time the experience has gone handheld.  There's a lot packed into this, which is very rewarding.  It can certainly go toe-to-toe with its console brethren, even if it isn't perfect.

The basic design of Smash has been unique since its inception.  Few games do what Smash does.  There are many single player modes to jump into, but chances are you'll first go straight to the multi-player  You can go in a match with up to four characters.  The objective is to keep bashing on your opponent until they build up enough damage that you can knock them off the stage.  Unlike most fighting games, Super Smash Bros. doesn't waste time with life bars.  Instead what it opts for is a percentage for each character.  The higher your percentage, the easier it is for you to be knocked off stage.  An attack won't send you anywhere when you're sitting at 7%, for instance, but if you're at 150% you'll be sent flying and possibly to your doom.  You can go into stock matches where everyone has a set number of lives, or you can go into timed matches.  Both are fun extremely fun.

The biggest reason Smash appeals to so many, however, is that it's relatively easy for just about anyone to play.  Every character has basic attacks and special moves.  The basic moves are roughly the same for every character.  These can also be charged to execute smash attacks which are crucial to knocking your opponent off the stage.  The special moves, however, are a bit more unique to the characters.  Link, for example, uses his arsenal of tools.  His arrows, bombs and boomerang for instance.  Marth specializes in his dancing blade, while Mario might use fire balls or F.L.U.D.D.  While it's simple to learn Super Smash Bros., the game appeals to the hardcore and newcomer alike.

Super Smash Brothers has a HUGE roster of over 40 characters.  Not all are unlocked from the start.  Some require fulfilling special conditions or partaking in a set number of battles.  The only real downside is that while there are certainly fewer clones than in Brawl, there are still clones.  Fox and Falco, for instance, are incredibly similar.  As are Marth and Lucina.  While the clones definitely have certain things that separate them apart, some aspects are just too familiar.  On the other hand, some characters are very unique.  The Villager, Mega Man and Pac-Man, for instance, are all characters that are truly unique (and also take time to learn).  Lastly, characters that used to transform are now their own separate character.  This means Sheik and Zero Suit Samus, for instance, are actually their own unique character with their own unique strategies.

The biggest addition is the ability to put a Mii in the fight.  You can make a Mii a gunner, swordfighter or brawler.  Gunners specialize in projectiles.  The sword fighter uses a sword and a brawler uses his fist.  You can also customize their move sets, particularly with their special moves.  It's quite unique and allows for lots of different possibilities.  It isn't just your Mii character that can be customized.  So can the main cast.  Throughout your battles and single player experiences you can unlock special moves that can be set to specific characters to change how they are in battle.  There is also equipment that can alter your stats as well.

Smash also has tons of items that appear on the stage.  Some, such as the beam sword, mushroom, and bob-omb are mainstays that have been around for a long time.  Brawl introduced a ton of items, but the 3DS version also offers some as well.  You can now collect pieces of a blaster and fire off a really powerful shot that is likely to kill anyone in a single shot.  There is now bullet bill from the Mario games and bombchus from Zelda.  These are just a couple of the new items.  Rest assured there are a lot.  If you get tired of any one of them you can go into the menu and turn them off one by one or turn off all of them in one fell swoop.

The Pokeball item also makes a return but there are a ton of Pokemon now, some that come from X and Y as well.  They always assist the player who releases them.  The assist trophies also return, but there is a lot more variety to them now.  Some of the annoying ones are back (did anyone really like the Nintendog assist trophy?) but some are quite unique.  You might get an assist trophy that releases pong, in which two paddles bat a ball all over the arena.  You might summon a robot master from Mega Man to assist or Dark Samus.  It's certainly interesting.

All of this can get to be incredibly chaotic at times.  But nothing gets as chaotic as a final smash.  When a smash ball appears and a character has it, their special transforms into a final smash.  These are basically the super moves of the game.  Some are incredibly powerful and useful.  Mario's final smash, for instance, attempts to push players off the screen.  Some are incredibly powerful (Mega Man's final smash is certainly a treat for long time Mega Man fans) while others might seem unfairly overpowered for those that don't avoid it (Marth) and others can feel downright underwhelming (such as Peach).  The only thing that really keeps the Final Smash's uninteresting is that some characters have the same ones.  One of the things I was hoping Nintendo would do was make each character's final smash unique in some way.  But some are still recycled.  Toon Link and Link both have the same final smash.  Shiek and Zelda also have the same Final Smash, for instance.  As do Fox and Falco.  As do Marth and Lucina.  It would've been nice to see them with more unique final smashes.

The chaos never really stops in a battle, though.  And sometimes it can feel like there's just too much going on.  Indeed, the levels can sometimes be overpopulated with items, while assist trophies are out and about while you're in the middle of fighting.  What's amazing is that the came keeps running smoothly through all of this.  There's certainly a lot to do in a match.  While the items might add an element of luck, Super Smash Bros. is actually quite a skill based game.  It is not a game where button mashing will assure you victory.  Learning to block and dodge are important.  Learning to grab edges (or guard them) is crucial to your success as a player.  The items add a level of chaos and unpredictability, but as you familiarize yourself with them you'll find ways around them too.  Super Smash Bros. can be intense.

If you don't feel like playing in an all out contest with friends or the CPU, you can always go into one of the various single player modes.  There is the classic mode which has you fighting various characters.  Sometimes they come with a few perks.  You might fight a metal one or a giant one.  Other times you just might have to fight off a multitude.  Occasionally you'll find yourself with an ally to help.  The classic mode ends with you fighting Master Hand.  What makes classic mode slightly different from the previous games is that you can choose a path to go down.  You'll always end up fighting Master Hand at the end, however.  Choosing one route or another might make a few differences in the rewards you stand to get, but aside from that it's going to be the same mode you remember.  You'll likely make a run through classic mode several times.

There are other single player modes.  There's the multi-man melee and there's also the home run contest.  There's another where you hit a bomb at a bunch of targets (this seems quite similar to Angry Birds).  The other big appeal is Smash Run.  This is quite similar to the Adventure Mode and Subspace Emissary, but much more toned down.  You'll run through a level getting as many powerups as you can find to increase things like your strength, speed and defense.  You've got a certain amount of time to collect as much as you can.  Once the time has run out, all your stat boosts carry into a Final Battle that plays just like a normal smash match, except with these enhancements and boosters.  The appeal of this is going to wear off very quickly.  The mode just isn't compelling enough to warrant so many plays.  It's quick, but there's nothing too particularly memorable about it.

The bread and butter of Smash has always been the multiplayer and the 3DS variant doesn't disappoint.  When playing with friends it's a very fun experience.  The connection was sometimes a little wonky, however.  I'm not sure if this is a major issue or not.  There were times when playing that my friends and I were in close proximity and we would lag out anyway.  I am not sure if this is a huge issue with anyone else.  The multiplayer only has a couple of issues.  The most important is that it can be easy to lose yourself in the bigger levels.  .  On larger levels where all four players get further apart, it can be hard to see yourself in the midst of all the chaos.  On smaller levels this isn't a big deal, but on larger ones it's going to be frustrating when you can't see where you (or your opponents) are.

The default controls don't always feel great.  You can, thankfully, change the controls in the options menu.  On the other hand, you must use the circle pad to move and do everything.  At some point, I actually wished I could've changed the control scheme to let me use the d-pad.  In some instances it would've made playing the game a whole lot easier.  The circle pad is sometimes a bit sensitive.  More than that, dashing or jumping can sometimes happen without you necessarily meaning for them to happen (but you can actually customize it so that you don't have to use the Circle Pad to jump).  You can either double tap in a direction to run, or quickly ""snap"" the circle pad in a direction (meaning do it quickly and your character will automatically run).  It's a bit touchy and sometimes it would've just been easier to just let players choose to use the d-pad.

Graphically, Super Smash Bros. 3D is quite a good looking game.  The stages themselves are gorgeous.  And despite the 3DS not being as powerful as a console, the amount of detail put into each level is fantastic.  So many moments in these stages are fun and unique.  The Super Mario 3D Land stage was a joy to play on.  Some classic stages return such as Corneria, but the new stuff is really quite creative.  These levels are really good.  The same goes for the music.  There are lots of familiar remixed tunes.  Likewise, there are a lot of tunes lifted from previous installments as well as from other games here.  From a presentation standpoint, Super Smash Bros. has never really disappointed.

There are a lot of things to do in Super Smash Bros. on the 3DS.  The challenge mode will show you that there are a ton of unlockables.  The game may be on a handheld, but there is certainly a lot of stuff to do and to unlock.  The 3DS version of the game could easily compare to the console versions.  There are a lot of trophies to collect throughout your endeavor.  There are also tons of stages to unlock and music soundtracks.  There's a lot to do in this game.  And it'll take you a long time to do it.  So rest assured, Super Smash Bros. will keep you busy.

Super Smash Bros., for the most part, has a pretty successful jump to handhelds.  There are a few things that keep the experience down, but overall it's an experience that is worth partaking in if you're a 3DS player.  The amount of customization and modes to play are enough to keep even the solitary player busy for long stretches of time.  For 3DS owners who've been playing Super Smash Bros. for a long time, this game is just as good.",10-03-2014

Super Smash Bros. isa fun and very popular game where you get to fight as characters from a variety of Nintendo games. I first played it on the Wii and absolutely loved it. I was excited when I heard that it was coming out for the 3ds. The fighting system and characters are similar to that of the previous Super Smash Bros, but the new one has different maps and a couple more characters to choose from.
You are also capable of customizing the stats of your characters in certain game modes. You can make the character a brawler, defender, or speedy. The characters that were in the Wii version have almost exactly the same moves. There are also a couple of mini games that you can also play with your favorite character.
My favorite part of the Wii version was the story mode. where you watch cut scenes of different characters' stories and then fight your way to the end in an almost platform like setting. And at the very end, you have to fight a last boss. I was disappointed that the 3DS version doesn't have that.",06-14-2016

https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,4,A great handheld Smash Bros game,"The Super Smash Bros series is inarguably one of Nintendo's most successful franchises.  I have been a huge fan of this fighting game franchise since the first game on the N64.  I have enjoyed all of the subsequent entries, my personal favorite being Brawl.  I was skeptical as to whether or not a portable Smash Bros would work.  I'm pleasantly surprised to say that it does.  While the Wii U version definitely feels like the definitive smash game, the 3DS version is none-the-less a very solid and entertaining portable fighting game.  The game, while smaller in scale in comparison to the Wii U version, still has plenty of substance to make it worth your while.
Graphics:  For a 3DS game, the visuals are very solid.  The stages and characters look great and the animation is very fluid.  The lag time seems a little more noticeable with more characters on screen due to the handhelds limitations, but things look very vibrant all in all.
Music:  The music selection here is more than great for this game.  The music is taken straight out of most of the games, and helps to make the frantic battles all the more fun.
Gameplay:  The controls an gameplay are very tight.  The Super Smash Bros games have always featured some of the finest multiplayer gameplay of any fighting game out there, and the 3DS manages to put that onto a portable handheld.
If there's anything less than stellar to this version of the game, its that hooking up with someone to play a match with, or even finding other people with 3DSs can be cumbersome and time consuming.  I find myself playing lots of matches alone.  Many of the stages, while very fun, feel at times like they were lifted from previous smash bros games.  With that to say, I really enjoyed some of the new stages like Gerudo Valley, Guar Plains, and the like.  Some of my favorite new characters are Shulk, Lucina, Greninja, and, of course, Pac Man.  Seriously, having Donkey Kong, Mario, Pac Man, and Sonic in one game is nothing short of amazing.  Classic characters that I like are Link, Samus, and occasionally Zelda or Captain Falcon.  This game has loads of characters, along with all the DLC ones like Cloud and Beyonetta.
All in all, this game feels right at home on the handheld.  While I consider the Wii U version of smash bros the Smash game to date overall, this handheld addition is a very welcome supplementary addition to the franchise.  If you don't own a Wii U and still want to experience a new Smash game, then you can't go wrong here.  This game will provide more hours of fun than most games can dream of doing.
Cons:
Cumbersome to hook up and find people with 3DSs
Recycles stages
Okay single player, doesn't add much to the game
Lag time
Pros:
Fantastic Gameplay
Nice colorful visuals
Fast paced action
Great musical tracks from Nintendo games
Loads of fun characters
Some of the highest replay ability of any game out there
Overall:
8.5/10

Each fighter (all from different prolific games) has a unique moveset that reflects their personality and the game they come from. Once you pick your favorite fighter and become good with them, you can fight bosses to unlock more characters, stages, and items. I love playing online against some of the more competitive players. It's a real test of skill that can turn out some exciting and fun matches! It's definitely a game for hardcore gamers, but there are plenty of other game modes that are perfect for casual gamers!

The characters are awesome and look really good. The game has been rebalanced so many of the flaws in brawl have been fixed. The game has been sped up a little.
Weak characters like captain falcon and ganondorf have been tweaked a bit so there BETTER but don't expect them to be top tier now.
Now for the flaws still plaguing the game. The one flaw i will mention is cloned character!! No im serious there are more clones in this game than in brawl. There are around five clones and most are EXACTLY like the chracters they emulate. It's a shame really cause so many new characters could have taken those slots oh well. Beyond that i cant find much wrong with the game at all. Everything works perfectly loading times are a bit long but that might be due to the fact that i got a 2ds cause I know they have slower processors. it's worth it though cause the game looks amazing.

Don't get me wrong. The game is fun and I enjoy it, I just wish there were more to do.

The last 3 DLC characters are a clear departure into ""Pay more to win more"" territory for Nintendo, however, and they completely break the graceful balance that made this one so good. It was before that any character would have a good shot at winning; even if there are tiered separations, nobody was 'bad.'
It's incredibly disappointing to see this happening with Nintendo. As one of the best games on the 3DS (and the Wii U), it feels like a huge setback in how much I'll like the systems as wholes. I felt before that I could safely buy a Nintendo game without deliberation because they would always do things properly, but I'm going to be much more cautious now.",02-06-2016

https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,5,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!,"Wow, this game is awesome. I don't know where to start. Let's just say I played Brawl and Melee and I wanted to play this, so I did. It's the best game you'll ever play. This may be a rather long review, so get ready. It'd be better to already have played any of the prequels before reading this.

Some SSB tournamenters thought Brawl sucked since it seemed slow and just gave an advantage to campers, dodgers, techers (the art of rolling, dodging, wall jump and and other stuff to passively defend you.) Some people like Mew2King, ZeRo, Nairo and a few others took it to another level.
Smash 4 doesn't need all that. Even though ledge-guarding is pretty much impossible because others can steal it, it takes more technique to play which most of the time isn't a bad thing. It isn't slow, it's hot in tournaments like the Big House, and is fun to play.

The DLC is exciting too. I was disappointed that that jerk Lucario replaced Mewtwo in Brawl and did again in Smash 4. But then DLC came out! Yay! And by disappointed, I meant extremely furious. But not any more! Now I can rek Lucario's face for just $3.99. Then Lucas came back. Exciting for people who played Brawl... like me! Then Roy! Yay for the Melee players, including me xD! Then Ryu surprised the crap outta everyone! Yay for Street Fighter! Then recently announced, Cloud Strife is coming into battle at an unknown day! Good for people who played Final Fantasy (not including me :'() The only one I actually have is Ryu though who brings his stage Suzaku Castle. Next, I'm gonna get Mewtwo. After Cloud who brings Midgar with him as a stage, ther's only one more fighter. Hopefully Wolf O'Donnell from Starfox will be it!

If you've played any Smash games before, get this. I can't tell you the basic idea because my words would be terrible. Just do it!!",11-16-2015

https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,4,"Has its flaws, but it is definitely worth owning.","I am truly amazed at what Nintendo was able to accomplish with this game on the 3DS. The game runs very smoothly. It looks like a home console release. The graphics are really impressive given what they had to work with. I got this game today, so I'll be updating when anything new comes up, but otherwise, the main part of the review will be right here.

Gameplay: The gameplay is great. There really isn't much else to say. You beat up famous Nintendo characters, and it is some of the best fun you'll have on the 3DS. The characters play at a smooth 60fps, it really amazes me. If you get an Assist Trophy, or throw a Pokeball, the character that comes out of it will only be doing their animations at 30 frames per second. However, you really don't notice all that much, it's not like they are there for very long anyways. I believe you can customize the controls, but they are pretty much perfect as is, aside from one issue. You cannot use the d-pad to move, you can only use the circle pad. I am a d-pad kind of person when it comes to games of the fighting variety, so this is a negative for me. The d-pad is used for taunts instead.

Story: There isn't one, much to my disappointment. I really enjoyed the Subspace Emissary of Brawl, at least what I played of it. It would be a HUGE plus if they had a story on this iteration of Smash, but that is sadly not the case. There is a lot of potential, especially with all of these new characters that have been added. This is probably three quarters of a star taken away, if not more.

Other Modes: Normal Smash. You just fight. It sounds really boring, but just thinking about it makes me want to get off the computer, pop the cartridge in the slot and play it before finishing the review. There's a multiplayer option, but I'll get into that a bit later. There is Smash run, which is fun but a bit hard. You go around a dungeon thingy and collect powerups, then after 3 minutes you fight using those power ups. It is quite fun, and is exclusive to the 3DS version, if I am not mistaken. There is classic mode, where you choose a character and fight some pre selected enemies until you get to the final boss. Those can be difficult as well. There are a few other modes, but there are too many to get into.

Wii U: I believe you can use the 3DS as a controller on the Wii U version of the game, but I don't own a Wii I, so I can't say anything about this.

Streetpass: There is Streetpass functionality for this game, but I have yet to encounter a fellow Smasher on the street.,

Online: This is where problems are...existent. There are 2 main modes: For Glory and For Fun. For Glory is where your battle stats are recorded and put in a leaderboard and all that. No items or anything like that. For Fun is just like normal Smash, but it is with online players. Smash Run can be played with LOCAL multiplayer, meaning somebody close by who also owns a copy of the game.  I only played For Fun, and boy was it hard. Not because of the fellow players and their skills, because of the RIDICULOUS lag. The lag can range from playable to 'turn the game off' bad. My first match was not possible to play. It took 30 seconds for any input I made to actually register. The worst part is that the other players seemed fine, and as a result I ended up getting ganged up on. The frames per second were so low, it looked like the world's oldest turtle was doing a slideshow of pictures from the game. The other matches were playable, but it still wasn't possible to win. It took 2 to 3 seconds for input to register, and the frames were tolerable except for a little freezing. But 2 to 3 second input lag is not acceptable when it comes to a fast paced game like Super Smash Bros. My point is: local multiplayer with somebody right next to you, you get the Wii U version.

In short, the game is very very fun, and it is amazing what Nintendo was able to do with such limited hardware. But for online matches, it would be best to look at the Wii U version of the game. And there's no story mode.",08-28-2015

Great fun with an amiibo (you can play against them, team up with them, level them up, and they even earn you coins and items).

If you have a new Nintendo 3DS with the added c-stick nub and additional triggers this is one game you must have next to Xenoblade.

I do miss the old campaign style from the previous smash bros games. They replaced that with smash run which is great fun and perfect if you have five minutes to take a break when you're not home.

New updates to the software now allow you to purchase DLC characters, costumes, and more items. Love it.",06-23-2015

Just three days ago I traded it in for Major's Mask, the smartest thing I've done yet. It was a HUGE let down, I never had video games when I was younger, so I never got to play SSB. I was very happy to finally get in on the action. But it was a wast, it took me no more than maybe 30 minutes to unlock everything. Plus the update downloads slowed my DS down so bad, it took nearly a minute to start up. I only have two games downloaded, it was stupid. To which it's not even a year old yet, I just got it last year for my birthday. And I've had just about every version of the DS yet.

After unlocking everything, there wasn't much else to do. There's a few side games and such, even so the game was under my, ""Play when bored"" games. And even when I was bored I still didn't want to play it, in fact I dreaded it. I don't have great internet so I couldn't play online and not one of my friends even had the game. They were all waiting to get the WiiU version. To which at the time I didn't have a WiiU, I do now, but I'm not about to get the game again.

With a roster of over 36 characters and secret unlockable characters that can be unlocked afterwards, this game offers different characters and variety for any player whether casual or constant. The new additions such as Pac-Man, Little Mac, and Mega Man offer unique moves and taunts that reflect on that character's game. For example, Pac-Man's moves consist of him eating dots and using ghosts to attack, as well as throw fruits like those he would collect in his Pac-Man game. This game is great, but it's only problem is online play. It's very slow and the lag as frame rate DROP gets me killed so often, and for someone who want to play for glory (smash bros' competitive play) these losses would go on record and it is really upsetting. If you own a 3ds/2ds, you don't want to miss this.",02-22-2015
https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,5,Nearly Perfect!,"As this is my first Smash Bros. game, I don't know how well it compares to its predecessors, but I can with confidence say that it is a fantastic game, and not one to miss.

GAMEPLAY-
 This isn't your typical brawler. In the main mode (Smash), up to four people compete using one of the 51 available characters in the game, and attempt, through various different abilities, to knock out (KO) the other characters from the playing field. The game plays from a 2D, from-the-side perspective. The player with the most KO's in the end wins.
 Overall, gameplay is very polished, fluid, and fun.

GRAPHICS-
 The graphics, for a 3ds game, are very nice. Maybe not quite as good as, say, MH, but they fit the game pretty well. The game also runs at a solid 60 FPS, which, for me, makes the graphics so much better. (I'm a sucker for good frame-rates. :) )

MUSIC-
 The music is fantastic! It takes themes from many different Nintendo franchises and mashes them all into one game! There is also a 'My Music' feature, which lets you listen to all the tunes and sound from the game. You can also listen to the music while the system is in sleep mode, as long as you have headphones, so it acts like an MP3 player in that way.

CONTENT-
 This is one of my few gripes about the game. It isn't that there aren't many game modes, it's just that the majority of them aren't very interesting, and become old very fast.

ONLINE PLAY-
 Multiplayer in this game is really fun. There are two main modes: 'For Fun,' and, 'For Glory.'
 The For Fun mode, as the name implies, is aimed at being fun. Your wins and losses are not recorded, and items are enabled. The For Glory mode is aimed at more competitive players. Your wins and losses are recorded, and items are not enabled.
 Now these would both be awesome if it weren't for the gameplay lag that's almost universal in every online mode. I'm sure you're already aware of this issue, but it seems wrong not to bring it up.

OVERALL-
 Other than the few issues mentioned by me and other reviewers, this really is a great game, and a definite 'must-buy' for 3ds owners.

https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,4,Celebrate Nintendo/gaming history on the go.,"The beautiful thing about a new Smash Bros. game is that it means something different but equally special to everybody. To me, Smash has always been about celebrating and basking in Nintendo's fabled history. In every way imaginable, Smash Bros. is the very gaming embodiment of celebration, but it also happens to be one of the best multiplayer games around, one of the best fighting games around, and simply one of the funnest games around. Also, owing to Nintendo's remarkable restraint (you can bet if Ubisoft/EA/Activision had Smash, it'd get yearly full-priced releases), a new entry in the series comes only once a console generation, making each one a genuine event. This particular entry is noteworthy because it is the very first one to appear on a handheld alongside a console version, something fans had begged for years to see. Now that we received it, one question begs to be asked: was it worth it? Is Smash 3DS all it could have been? For the most part, yes it is.

At its core, Smash is all about playing as your favorite Nintendo character, beating the tar out of other famous Nintendo characters, with the hope of sending them off the screen or, at the very least, far enough they can't make it back to the stage. The control scheme is simple enough that anybody can grasp it, but nuanced enough where it takes genuine dedication to master any one of the now nearly 50 strong roster, if you want to. Or you could just pick your favorite character and go nuts for the fun of it all. That's the brilliant thing about Smash, it's easy enough for even the most inexperienced gamer to enjoy, but deep enough to reward skill/dedication levels of pretty much anyone. As far as the mechanics go, Smash 3DS is about as good as it gets. This feels like the ultimate combination of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brawl-s/dp/B000FQ9R4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brawl's</a>&nbsp;level of variety and inclusiveness and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Melee-s/dp/B00005Q8M0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Melee's</a>&nbsp;hardcore quality. The roster is fantastic as well, with way more characters than any Smash before. It's truly something special to be able to play as Mega Man, Pac-Man, Link, Toon Link, Ike, Lucina, Kirby, and Luigi (my personal roster). Thankfully, most of the characters feel unique. There are far fewer clones this time around, and even the ones that are there are often different enough to distinguish them on their own. So when it comes to the core of Smash, Smash 3DS nails it.

It is truly awesome to be able to play Smash wherever I go on my 3DS. For being the first Smash game on a handheld, this one is superb. The graphical power of the 3DS is most definitely pushed to its limits here. Nintendo did a great job optimizing this version to the hardware. This is a beautiful 3DS game. That is certainly true technically, but also artistically, as the game shines brilliantly and coherently. Despite having so many different art styles, the game feels artistically cohesive and harmonious; a huge feat to be sure.  Things you'd think would hamper the experience, like the small screens, are deftly handled with various visual effects like customization options for character outline thickness and other things. The soundtrack is also fantastic. Featuring most, if not all, songs from the Wii-U version, it's just great to hear all the neat new remixes and renditions of classic Nintendo songs. All-in-all, the presentation of Smash 3DS is top-notch.

Smash 3DS differentiates itself from the Wii-U version by focusing much more on Nintendo's handheld history. This is most evident in the stage selection and collectibles. Whereas Smash Wii-U has a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skyward-Sword/dp/B002BSC54I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skyward Sword</a>&nbsp;themed Zelda stage, Smash 3DS has one focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirit-Tracks/dp/B001TOQ8UW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirit Tracks</a>. This is true almost across the board and while the two versions do share SOME of the same, they are mostly unique. This is probably what makes Smash 3DS worth getting for hardcore Nintendo fans alone. To me, the key to ""winning"" a Smash game is in acquiring its collectibles, trophies namely, and the 3DS version offers tons of unique Handheld themed trophies. Again, to name an example, Smash Wii-U has&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wind-Waker-HD/dp/B002I0GF72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wind Waker HD</a>trophies, Smash 3DS has&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ocarina-of-Time-3D/dp/B003O6E800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ocarina of Time 3D</a>&nbsp;trophies. The differences between the two versions definitely make both worthy of a purchase for hardcore Nintendo fans.

You may wonder then, why did I only give this version 4-stars? The truth is, while Smash 3DS is truly a great entry in the series, it is out-shined in virtually every way by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/its-Wii-U-counterpart/dp/B00DD0B0BM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">its Wii-U counterpart</a>. Smash Wii-U feels like the TRUE next gen version of Smash. It has much more features, content, modes, stages, and not only more, but better too. Smash 3DS has no multiplayer board game mode, no 5-8 player smash, less trohpies, less stages, less challenges, etc. The unique modes the 3DS version introduces are not very good on their own either, and some of the traditional modes like ""classic"" pale in comparison to the unique, envelope pushing versions found in the Wii-U version. All that been said, Smash 3DS is still a great entry in the series, and probably equal to Melee in quality. That's a huge compliment from me, as Melee has always been my favorite Smash until the new Wii-U entry hit the series out of the park.

All-in-all, it's hard to be disappointed by the very first handheld Smash Bros. game. Nintendo did a superb job making this feel like its own, unique entry in the series that wasn't watered down or diluted because of its status as a handheld game. Ultimately, any Smash game is all about celebrating Nintendo heritage. Smash 3DS certainly meets that goal with aplomb. So whether you're an old Nintendo fan or a new one, and you want to revel in fabled gaming history while also playing one of the best fighting/party games around on a handheld, Smash 3DS gets a strong recommendation. It's a great little game. Buy it, prepare for some serious fun, and enjoy this nice little celebration of Nintendo goodness on the go.",01-27-2015

Not many games compare to the series. Super smash bros for 3Ds and wiiU is the best super smash bros yet. If you love super smash bros,then you should get this game for your 3Ds or wiiU. Besides,it's just plain awesome.

  Improvements

Nintendo did a amazing job on this. First of all,the graphics are beautiful. Very well detailed. All the characters look very real. Best graphics for super smash bros. Plus,New characters like chazarid,grininja,dark pit,lucina,and more. All new maps have been added like lumious city and resident bomb.(well,I think it was added to this one). Smash run has been added. You have to collect as many stat bousts as possible and then do something at the end like 300% smash or a race. All star mode was made so you can battle all characters in order. Like which ones came first. Like brawl,you can fight online,too. You can play up to 8 players at once!!!!

  Hidden characters

If you play enough,you can unlock hidden characters. They are falco,jigglypuf,dark pit,R.O.B,Luciana,wario,ness,rosalima and luma,duck hunt,mr game and watch,and bowser jr. They are add ons to the game. They also help you beat the game.

  Tips

The game can be hard,so here are some useful tips. If you want characters that are fast,then I recommend fox. He is very fast and is also very good in battle. If you want a strong player,then use samas. She is amazing in battle. Her charge up attack is very powerful. Stay away from the villager. He is op.(not kidding). Unless you want to annoy someone,then don't use kirby!!!! All he does is swallow you and takes your power!!!! Really annoying.

  All the characters

Here are all the characters. Fox and falco(from star fox). Pikachu,mewtwo,chazarid,jigglypuf,grininja,and lucario(from pokemon). Link,toon link,Zelda,and gandrof(from the legends of Zelda). Mario,Luigi,bowser,and peach(from super Mario bros). Kirby,meta knight,and king dedaede(from kirby). Little mac(from punch out!). Sonic(from sonic the hedgehog). Pit,dark pit,and pauathina(from kid icaurs). Villager(from animal crossing). Ness(from mother and earth bound). Yoshi(from yoshi). Samas and zero suit samas(from metorid). Donkey Kong and deyede kong(from donkey Kong). Duck hunt(from duck hunt). Mr game and watch(from game and watch). Losaumia and Luna,and boswer Jr(Mario galaxy). Mega man(from mega man). Dr Mario(from Dr Mario). Captain falcon(from f-zero). Marty,lucania,and ike(from fire enamble). Wii fit trainer(from some wii game). And mii fighters(from mii channel).(because that mii character you made can become a mii fighter).

  Download character

By using the Nintendo eshop,you can download mewtwo. I think it's awesome since mewtwo is a good pokemon. You should download him. I mean,come on,he's epic.

Anyways,this game is great and I highly recommend this game. So much fun!!!! Super smash bros is one of Nintendo's greatest hits!!!! Get it now!!!! Download it at the Nintendo eshop,or buy the game itself. I love the game and so will you!!!!",01-23-2015

Whether you're a Day 1 buyer or coming late to the party, Smash has plenty of treats to go around.  Partake in 4-way brawls for fun or for glory.  Explore a vast labyrinth filled with stat boosts and power-ups.  Use them to customize your favorite fighter or create your own.  Challenge the rest of the world in online play orin a rather controversial featurebet on it for fake money.  And then blow said money on virtual trophies (or blow real cash on physical ones).

Every virtue has its defect, however.  First, movement is restricted to the Circle Pad on the 3DS, taking away the precision provided by the D-Pad.  Also, the in-game camera often pans out to the point where you cant tell characters apart.  You can only use customized and Mii fighters against actual people or by yourself.  A software update from Nintendos eShop is just the latest of many required for the online modes.  But its really an excuse to tweak the roster and undo any distinct advantages.  So everybody wins!  And that thing where you bet fake money on matches; they're all replays, nothings live.
Despite these drawbacks, they don't beat the feeling of knocking 2 plumbers and an ape off a floating platform with an oversized hammer.  You even hear voices chant your name (They don't chant your actual name, but you get the gist).

Thank you.

Super Smash Bros. has easily become Nintendo's most popular and well-known fighting series since the first game's debut on the Nintendo 64 many years ago (and it's not surprising that some of you probably don't even know what an N64 is), and with the release of the Gamecube, we were given Super Smash Bros. Melee, which also did extremely well and was well-received by the fanbase. When the Wii came out, we got Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which also did very well, provided the Wii's graphical and technical limitations. When we heard about this game coming to our store shelves November of 2014, why, fans all over the world were awestruck at the very thought of a portable Smash Bros game for their very own handheld 3DS and 3DS XL systems! But the sad truth is, while that's definitely a winning factor, the game brings nothing new to the table. So let's crack open this can of age-old worms and take a look at Smash Bros 3DS!

--STORY--
Sadly, this is the first time I've ever had to do this, but we're going to skip this section because Smash Bros doesn't have an actual story. Sorry, better luck next time.

--GAMEPLAY--
The exact same mechanics as the previous games in the series all return to glory for this handheld release. Upon starting the game, you're greeted with a familiarly-styled menu with a small handful of options, the main one of course being Smash. Players are given a total roster of 50+ characters to choose from, including their own custom-made Mii fighter, where you can choose any Mii from your Mii Plaza and create a fighter based on three different categories: Brawler, Swordfighter, and Gunner. From there, you can equip them with a very small variety of Badges you obtain by accomplishing certain tasks, which will increase the overall performance of your character. You can also choose to customize their appearance using different types of headgear and body clothing, making for a mildly amusing break away from the norm of Smash Bros. Talk about total lack of interest, though, when it came to this feature. The options for personalizing your character are minimal at best, and the most you can get are maybe half a dozen different outfits, a couple dozen different headgears that are either boring or Nintendo mascot-themed (which was an immediate downside for me), and maybe 20 different Badges to unlock for your character that give them boosts in combat, some in which give you beneficial effects in combat, such as starting with a Beam Sword or a Home Run Bat, or even giving you the chance at 10-second invincibility if you land the first hit. But seriously, this is all we get. THIS is all we get.

Now, the one thing you've been waiting for: the actual fighting! As mentioned before, you have a total roster of over 50 characters to choose from, most of which are characters from previous Smash games, only this time, they're accompanied by the one thing I cannot STAND about this series: I call them ""Clones."" Clones are basically different fighters that play roughly the exact same way the original characters do, such as Dr. Mario being exactly like regular Mario, and trust me when I say this: they're EVERYWHERE in this one. It was a funny little idea back in Melee, and I didn't really care about Luigi being in the original Smash, but ever since Brawl, this seems to be a staple. A very annoying, incredibly lazy staple. Dr. Mario, Luigi, Toon Link, Ganondorf, Falco, Ike, Robin, Dark Pit, and Lucina are the main offenders of this game.

Now, I won't go into detail of every individual character's movesets and specials, but I will state that, if you've played any of the Smash games before this one, you're pretty much set. No new enhancements or features were added from Brawl; if you knew all the flashy dodges and the perfectly-timed Samus cannon shots from the previous installment, you'll be fine. That is, until you factor in the flimsy design of the 3DS control pad.

The selection of Stages to play on was also a big disappointment for me. I liked infiltrating Wily's Castle every so often, and me and my friends played the tar out of Final Destination for competitive matches, but I honestly found nothing pulling me into any of the other ones. I've either seen them before, or I simply didn't care. Each Stage still has its little gimmicks that are SUPPOSED to add tension and drama to combat, but they really didn't do anything for me. The game's Classic Mode tried to stray away from the previous linearity, but it still keeps literally every other predictable element it had before. You fight a few regular characters, you fight a giant character or two, you fight a team of characters, you fight a metal version of a character, you fight Master Hand, you finish the game. Done and done. All-Star Mode returns, and yes, it's the exact same thing from before, so don't expect anything to be new except what stages you play on.

Also, and this may not seem like such a big deal to some, I found the Intensity mechanic to be extremely annoying. Why, pray tell, should I have to PAY in order increase or decrease the game's difficulty? When you choose Classic Mode, you can set the Intensity of your coming ""adventure"" before you start. Naturally, the higher the Intensity, the more difficult enemies will be, but also, they added ""rewards"" to the game (like Trophies and extra Badges that you may, or may not, already have), so the higher the risk, the ""better the reward."" At least, that's what the game tells you. But the truth is, you can win pretty much anything on lower Intensities that you can win plowing through your enemies on 9.0 Intensity, the highest it goes. When you play through Classic Mode, you get two lives, regardless of difficulty. If you finish a match, you get one additional life. If you die and have to continue, you'll start with two lives again. This is all fine and dandy until you get to higher difficulties and eventually make your way to Master Hand and, if you play on a high enough difficulty, Crazy Hand.

--PRESENTATION--
I'll just get this off my chest right off the bat. After the first few hours of gameplay, I was sick of it. This really is one of those games you need to play in moderation, rather than just sit down and play it all day, every day. There's nothing really new or exciting about this game, and it certainly doesn't bring anything new to the world of Smash Bros. Sure, we get new characters and different Stages, but that's exactly what CAPCOM said to its fans when they released Marvel VS CAPCOM 3 and its expansion; it's like paying full price to play a game you played *insert period of time* before, only now, it has new stages and characters. It's the exact same game! There's nothing new, and if there is, it's nothing worth writing home about. In all honesty, I'd have much more fun playing Melee, because at least there, the game is played on a much faster and smoother engine, meaning it's a lot nicer for competitive matches. The game feels empty and repetitive, and that's one of the biggest things you need to worry about with Presentation: how a game makes you feel when you play it. It's a very forgettable game, in my honest opinion.

--SOUNDTRACK--
Nothing to really set this game apart from any others, especially not from the previous installments of the series. See, with this, Nintendo clearly didn't care TOO much about the soundtrack, because they knew your main concerns would be the new characters and stages. So, they got their several new composers to make an entirely new track list for this game, and let me tell you, I found it to be completely unmemorable and lifeless. The new Smash theme is catchy, but not after hearing it ten-million times going back and forth between menus and fights.

--OVERALL RATING: 6/10--
Boy, am I glad I wasn't waiting for this. In fact, the moment I heard a new Smash game was coming out, I sighed. Heavily. The mere thought of the Smash Bros. franchise going any further than this is terrifying, especially now that I've played all four games in the series. You can find several fighting games out there that will blow this one--and even its predecessors--out of the water and to the other half of the planet. If you want an interesting fighting game with a lot of cool features and genuinely attractive game feel, go with the early entries in the Soul Calibur series; at least Namco does THEIR fighting games with spirit and articulation, instead of relying on a massive hill of meaningless hype and the relentless, undying support of blind fans.",01-09-2015

The 3D is beautiful, the fighting runs smoothly, and the new boss in classic mode (Encountered at difficulty 7.0 or higher I believe) is amazing! I like to play as Link, and I've mastered his every move. I've trained for days against level 9 CPUs and even won a few times online! There's only two problems with this beautiful game; the online is slow, even if my internet connection is excellent, and there are too many clones for comfort. However, they've brought new characters, like Little Mac, Mega Man, even Rosalina and Luma! They each have their own colorful movesets, they each have their own fort (for instance, Sonic is great in speed and jumping, but not as powerful as other characters, Samus is excellent in defense and power, but not as fast as other characters, etc.) They've also announced that Mewtwo is returning as DLC some time in the future, so any veteran smasher who misses Mewtwo, pick up this game at once! Also, this means there's hope for other characters to return! My personal hope is for Lucas to return, maybe slightly nerfed? Also, looking forward to new characters as DLC! This ends my review!

https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,4,I can say that Super Smash Bros 3DS has some extremely enticing features...,"As a member of the competitive smash community, I can say that Super Smash Bros 3DS has some extremely enticing features for advanced players. It is part a new handheld gaming craze to bring console and TV games to the device in the palm of your hands. The 3D effects are also revolutionary and the characters really do pop out of the screen.

I have had the game for five days now and I am really enjoying its portability. The added feature of WiFi battles against other players is a great way to play against your friends or practice your skills against random people around the world.

The Smash Bros series in general has a very steep learning curve. Tutorials are almost nonexistent and the tips are difficult for beginners to understand. With that said, however, the 3DS version has many less skills and is significantly easier to be successful after a lot of practice, especially since you can play against others online. It is a great game to have to play casually with friends.

If you are a more advanced player, this game is a step in the right direction but is not quite there. Nintendo is strongly encouraging competition and online play in this version of the game, but its mechanics are lacking. On the ground, the mechanics have gotten faster and are very similar to Melee, but the air game is extremely slow and has not improved at all. Smash Bros 3DS is all about racking up damage on your opponent and finishing them off with a smash attack. That's it. Aerial attacks in this game are so weak, DI is so overpowered that it is almost impossible to edgeguard, and you can only kill someone by knocking them completely out of the stage. Smash Bros 3DS has also brought about a new breed of characters, which I call ""support"" characters (if you have ever played a MOBA game you will understand me), they are great for team battles because of their abilities but are completely useless for 1v1 battles.

If you are a new player or a casual smash player, I definitely recommend buying it because it is endless entertainment. If you are an advanced player, you may not be too satisfied with the game's mechanics, but nothing else offers a portable version of the game and the 3D effects are a sight to see.",12-24-2014

It has all the fighters from the Wii U version but not all the stages.  It does however have some stages that the Wii U version doesn't, which evens things out.

This version also has a mode that the Wii U doesn't, and again the Wii U has one mode this doesn't... almost like they want you to buy both versions.  Of course if you DO buy this version AND the Wii U version you do unlock the Mewtwo character as free DLC in the future.

As for the game itself it plays well, has a large selection of characters and stages, and a decent amount of songs for each stage.

The characters are amazing, the stages are beautiful, and it's a blast to play. My only complaint is the controls. It takes a while to get use to not having a c-stick and having to solely rely on using the circle pad for both tilt and smash attacks. It also doesn't help that this game doesn't support the Circle Pad Pro as a c-stick. But like I said, it may take a while, but you'll get the hang of it.

Before this, I actually never showed interest but this game made me realize that mistake.  You have tons of classic characters to choose from, though my top choice is Link from the Legend of Zelda, though I enjoy playing other characters.

The music is wonderful and the area are fun to play in with some having environments you can use to your advantage.  There are tons of items in the game you can use to aid in smashing the other opponents and the final smashes are cool.  The graphics are amazing and detailed.

There is even tons and tons of content, such as mini-games, a classic mode, various ways to play Smash, trophies you can get from gold or play coins, which is good because I walk a lot and at the end of the month can max my play coins.  There are challenges you can defeat to unlock even more content.

The only thing I didn't care for was the  Smash Run, which is where you are in a labyrinth collecting power-ups from treasure chests and random enemies to help strengthen you up for a final battle.  I just didn't enjoy it because it drags on too long and I get confused easily and if you're smashed you lose some of your upgrades.  However, I wouldn't call it terrible because it does add challenge and I bet someone will have a better time with it than me.",11-03-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,5,Settle it in Smash! The flagship title for the Nintendo 3DS.,"Super Smash Bros for the 3DS. Where to begin? It's the 4th title in the Smash Bros series. An absolutely monumental title, it had an elaborate series of events leading up to it's launch. The hype was overwhelming, and it's finally here. Was it worth the wait?

This is Nintendo's flagship franchise. If you aren't familiar with the series, it takes a slew of Nintendo characters and themes and throws them altogether to create one crazy fighting game of epic Nintendo proportions. The way it works is like this. You fight up to 3 other players and smash them with punches, kicks, and special moves to make their damage percentage increase. The higher the percentage, the more they will fly. Smash them off the screen, and they lose a life. Very simple, yet very effective.

The controls are fluid and work great. Each character has 4 unique special moves, all with the use of the B button. The character roster is enormous. The original Smash had 12 characters, which seemed like a lot at the time. This was 1999. We are now up to over 45 characters. It's quite overwhelming, yet a welcome addition.

There are plenty of stages to choose from, all taken straight out of other Nintendo games, but designed exclusively for this game. Mega Man, Pac-Man, and Sonic are included as guest characters from other companies, and each one has their own stage and music from those franchises. It's great to see crossovers like this. All three play great and were not designed as a mockery to their fanbase.

The graphics are great and run smoothly. The levels are vibrant and colorful. There is a ton of music in this game, and it's all nostalgic and brings back memories of these great franchises we've grown to know and love.

The game is SO full of content to unlock. There are over 650 trophies to collect from all the games represented, as well as dozens of other Nintendo games. It's full of rich gaming history. There are characters, stages, and customization items to unlock. There is also 3 pages of Challenges to complete, as well as in-game achievement system called Milestones. You'll be busy for months with this one.

It also features a robust online multiplayer. It's very competitive. There are thousands of matches being recorded and uploaded to YouTube daily. It's easily the most competitive game on the system next to Pokemon.

Pokemon get a lot of love in this game, there are 5 playable Pokemon as well as 2 Pokemon stages and dozens of Pokemon trophies. You can throw Pokeballs to call out random Pokemon that do damage to your opponents.

There are many different items to use to aid you in your battles, but if you don't like them you have the option to turn them off. You can customize everything, from how many lives per match, to what items you want to use if any, and to the damage your attacks will do. You can also create custom Mii fighters and deck them out with masks and clothing that you acquire. You can also customize each fighter and raise or lower their stats, as well as change their special moves. It's insane what's all included in this package.

This is easily the biggest game on the 3DS. It deserves a spot in every Nintendo fan's collection. The best part is this is only the beginning. There is an even bigger version coming out on the Wii U. I suggest you start with this one. And don't forget to settle it in Smash!",11-02-2014

The character selection and variable means to unlock means there is a mode of play for everyone. I personally love the single player campaign from the Wii version for unlocking characters around the story. This is a missing on the handheld however several other many games and customization totals for how you can unlock characters items outfits gear, and again moved that is quite similar to single player make it very worth it. An absolute must buy if you were getting the way you version because this skills into the character you will already have been working on with the handheld mean greater understanding of the modern system of fighting and is a character that has been scaling for months.",10-29-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,5,"The first handheld Super Smash Bros is finally here, and it couldn't be much better","What can I say? I've wanted to play Smash Bros on the go ever since I first got my DS back in Christmas of '05. It's especially important to me now that I'm in college and don't have any home consoles with me. The E3 announcement in 2011 was music to my ears, but I knew there was a long wait ahead.

More than three years later, the game is finally here. And it's better than I would ever have expected. Mostly because of the new characters, to be honest. When Wii Fit Trainer and Villager were announced, I figured Nintendo was scraping the bottom of the barrel. Like seriously, how many Nintendo characters are left? But as I read the character predictions over the following several months and got Fire Emblem: Awakening and Kid Icarus: Uprising for Christmas of 2013, I started developing a list of characters that I wanted. Well, I'm pretty amazed but delighted to say that most of them got in. I mean, you've got a great trifecta of beautiful but powerful women in Palutena, Lucina, and Rosalina. Then you've got Greninja, the Miis, Robin, and Bowser Jr., all of whom I wanted. There are a total of 15 newcomers (or 17 if you count all three Miis), and I wasn't expecting more than maybe ten.

But in addition to the characters I wanted, they gave me characters that I didn't even know I wanted. Characters like Wii Fit Trainer, Villager, Pac-Man, and Duck Hunt sure seem like bizarre choices, but their unique move sets make them so fun to play as. And then you've got Little Mac. I had never played a Punch-Out game until long after he was announced, but he just fits so perfectly. One of the most famous fighting games ever finally got a character that originated in a fighting game. You almost have to wonder why they didn't add him sooner. As I've never played Xenobalde, Shulk just looked like a generic guy with a sword to me. But those Monado Arts make him a very unique character.

The only newcomer I'm not thrilled with is Dark Pit. As much as I love Kid Icarus: Uprising, it's hard to justify clones. Well, okay, Lucina's a clone, but she's so beautiful and strong that I don't care. I feel that Dark Pit was the most bland character in Uprising. But it's hard to complain about having an extra character that you don't have to play as. It's not like Dark Pit took Viridi's spot or anything. They just threw him in at the last second for the heck of it.

They did cut six characters, but I think they made the right choices (mostly). Five out of the six should never have been in the game in the first place. The Ice Climbers are a sad story, though, because they were only cut due to hardware issues. Maybe they'll get them to work and release them as DLC, but I wouldn't count on it.

Well, I don't really feel like going into detail about all the other features of this game. I'll just summarize with a pro/con list.

Pros
-The roster, see everything I wrote above.
-Custom moves, and the brilliant idea to have Palutena and the Miis start with all of them.
-You can finally play Super Smash Bros on the go
-Smash Run is a blast
-All-Star mode is taken to the next level as you can't continue, and you face the characters in the order that they debuted
-Lots of fun new items and Assist Trophies
-Five of the newcomers have Counter or something similar as their down-B special move, and now that I'm learning how to take advantage of it, I realize it's pretty satisfying to watch your opponents' attacks backfire
-Lots of trophies to unlock and Challenges to clear to keep the game fun for a long time

Cons
-RIP Ice Climbers
-If any of the four players in a Wi-Fi match has a poor connection (as in they're more than a few feet away from their router), then the game lags for everyone
-The stage bosses are just annoying, especially the guy at Wily's Castle
-There aren't as many new stages (or as many stages total, for that matter) as there were in Brawl
-Putting the clones in the corner of the character selection screen instead of next to the characters from their franchises was just lazy and makes them look even more like they don't belong in the game
-The clever title of the game
-No stage builder
-No event matches
-No Subspace Emissary
-Once you get used to the controls, level 9 computers are usually not too tough to beat, and I'm a pretty casual player
-There should be more than just a single one-minute match at the end of Smash Run, I'd prefer a series of at least three so that the five minutes of powering up matters more
-Target Blast isn't that great, and I miss the Target Test from Melee
-After watching the Direct for the Wii U version, I feel like this game is so inferior

But don't let these cons turn you off. Most of them feel like minor quibbles when you're actually immersed in the game. It's far more than just an appetizer for the Wii U version. Please buy it.",10-27-2014

The fact that this game is on a handheld will help it have legs for years to come and always be playable. It's what you expect from a smash game but it is lacking in the content department. Less fighters, less stages, less single player content then Brawl but I personally expected it due to 3DS constraints. Online play is better then the previous title but plenty of issues still remain.

The bigger issue to me is the old 3DS has performance issues in local and wireless with frames dropping and long load times while the new 3DS which is Japan/Australia only at the moment fixes a lot of those problems due to better specs but until we have that handheld available. Once we get the new 3DS here I could see this going up to 5 stars but until then some glaring issues stop the game from being great.",10-23-2014

Smash returns solid. worries undone.,"I was worried about this game being shallow like the ultra street fighter 4 and persona arena but the game itself proves me wrong and has ton of modes to have fun with and plenty of brand new fighters to play as. the game story is pretty simple just play as your favorite game or nintendo character and fight,fight and fight. plenty of solo play modes - classic mode(arcade mode),training mode,all star(survive horde after horde of all the characters you have unlocked),the new smash run(a short but fun side scroll run to collect powers ups,beat up monster,and collect collectibles. after the side scroll run ends you compete with npcs or participated players in 1 random final bout with different win requirements. whoever wins gets the rarest loot.)mii survival mode 5 types of it, home run contest,and lastly trophy rush(a fun mini game to use in game currency to get as much trophies as possible.) so yeah alot to do. it even has versus against npcs or adhoc pvp as well as wifi. there is even setting to have a plain platform for all stages for those who hate stage hazards so glad not having to fight in final destination all time,a very welcomed setting. alot of unlockable characters and some few hidden stages as well. they also reworked returning fighters,not by alot but some changes has been made. for example -gannondorf s warlock punch takes a couple of hits now to stop the attack from completing. for the first time you customize a fighter of your choosing with different 12 specials that you collect over time through single player modes and change the speed,power,defense with equipment you collect over time. which very neat to see that almost like dissidia approach. can choose to turn off or on on customized are allowed in simple smash versus or smash run which very thoughtful and needed. the only downside to this game is too much lazy clone characters made it in like in they didn't even try to make them there own. I believe it would of been better to see Lucas,Mewtwo and the ice climbers return and have the roster then lazy clone characters. the last downside is theres no prerecorded intro. brawl had a great one. that all said,the is still very solid with very little downs. as fan i want to give it 5 out 5 but mistakes have to be pointed out no matter how much i love the game and im glad i bought this one. no dlc garbage either exploitations too which is fantastic. all content available as it should be. i almost forgot theres records as well of your exploits in all modes offline local and online which is very good to see how much thought went in too this game. so many good things that not buying isn't a option.",10-21-2014

If you, too, were so amazed at how terrible Super Smash Bros. Brawl was, you will definitely have more positive thoughts towards this game. Some things that are improved from Brawl are the game speed, and the relatively lower amount of input lag. The online play, while still not great, is better than before, because Bandai has given us more of a competitive, single-player mode. This game is still not as good as Melee, but the fact that you can play it anywhere you want is a cool new feature for the Smash Bros. series.",10-16-2014

Online mode is pretty fun, but the fights can extremely lag if you don't have the decent wifi (I use cox high speed internet and it works pretty well with almost no lag).  The game has multiple styles of minigames and actual one on one fights so theres really high replay value.

Pros:
-Great character selection
-Online works well (for the most part: there is lag on occasion, but if your connection is good you can find non-laggy matches easily)
-Portable Smash for the first time ever!
-If you get both games, you get a Soundtrack from Club Nintendo
-Controls are good, aside from a few complaints below
-""Final Destination"" variants of every stage
-The Streetpass mode looks fun (I've only done the practice mode)
-The one-player modes are fun if you haven't done them before (but somewhat repetitive otherwise)
-Some cool items (bullet bill, the capture ship from Galaga, etc.) have been added

Cons:
-A lot of the stages seem uninspired (although the Final Destination variants are clever), although there are good stages too
-A good deal of the music is from past Smash games (enough to where I noticed it; this wasn't an issue in past games)
-No C-stick equivalent on the 3DS or 3DS XL and the L/R buttons feel awkward to use on a handheld (although the second complaint may be because I'm using a case on my 3DS XL).
-Smash Run could use some improvement; right now it seems very chance-based and not something I'd play more than a few times
-It's hard to have a ""pick up and play"" 4-player offline match with other people, since each person needs their own copy of the game.

If those cons don't bother you, pick this game up. I enjoy this game a lot, but I suspect the Wii U version will be better, if only for the fact that you'll be able to play Smash in the same room as other people without 2-4 handhelds. A large part of what makes this game fun is the couch multiplayer, and playing it online isn't quite the same to me. It's a lot more fun winning (and losing) to your friends than it is to a stranger you can't even talk to. So if you can only get one version, I'd wait on the console one.

That being said, this is a fun game. If you have a 3DS, I'd get it. If you don't have a 3DS, this isn't a ""system seller"" for anyone who isn't a hardcore Super Smash Bros. fan.

https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,5,Mainly a review of my experiences online,"I'm writing a review of my experiences with the game. Honestly, I have only really played online - mainly a certain mode, but I have dabbled a bit in a few other modes.

Online offers the ability to play with friends or strangers. From there, you can choose to play for fun (""For Fun""), or to play competitively (""For Glory""). In the For Glory mode, which is the mode I've been playing, your wins and losses are recorded. Also, items are turned off, as is the Super Smash ability (which for most characters gives the ability to knock off a stock from opponents), so the only thing you can rely on is your abilities. There are different modes, one that lets you fight other people one on one, one where you can team with someone, and one where you compete with others.

Overall, I've enjoyed my experiences online, and there are quite a few competitive players. I've read somewhere there is an algorithm that matches you based on your performance, so if you keep winning, you will play against other people who have good records. Start losing a lot of matches, and you will be matched with people who don't have as good of a record. I've noticed this when I started winning, you start facing people who don't just stand and let you hit them. Most of my games have been lag free, although occasionally there is a game where it becomes unbearable. But these have been few. There is also apparently a mode called Smash Run where you can get powerups to boost your abilities before battle, but I haven't tried this.

Outside of online multiplayer, there are the traditional modes from the older games - an arcade mode where you have to fight various opponents before battling Master Hand. This time you are placed on a path and can pick from a branch of challenges, which offer different rewards. There are secret characters that can be unlocked by beating this mode and also accomplishing other criteria, although I don't really know what those are. There is also apparently a streetpass mode that is like a minigame but I haven't played this yet. I'll try to update once I do.

From my experience, the controls for the game aren't quite as good as playing on a gamepad, but you do get used to them. If you are interested there is also a demo of the game on the eshop. Overall, I would highly recommend this game if you are a fan of Smash Bros.",10-10-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,5,A New Favorite!,"I'm quite happy with this installment of SSB. I think it may be a sign of my advancing age, but I wish there was more of a tutorial that illustrated the changes between this game and its predecessors.

Available modes include Smash for Single or Group, Online, Challenge, and Smash Run ( which gives you a time limit to complete the stage).

This is a a good step up from brawl. The game feels faster and less floaty while still providing the player with more diversity than even brawl. The game feels even more balanced than the previous three because the big characters are faster and more viable to play.

The only complaint i have is how nintendo still doesn't understand how to make and enjoyable online experience. It's a lot better than brawl's online but it still feels a step behind Sony and Microsoft.

If you like smash, have access to a good wifi connection, and can get over some of the limitations of playing the game on a 3ds, then this game is perfect for you.

It has a great selection of game styles, as well as some interesting new characters, in addition to old favorites!

https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,5,:),"(My friend bought this for me as an early Christmas present, so I can't speak for the shipping speeds, or quality of delivery.)

A long while ago, my grandma bought me a N64, and a game with ""a Pokemon on the front."" No, it wasn't Hey you Pikachu, it was the very first installment of Super Smash Brothers. Ever since that glorious day, I've been hooked on the series, and it's ""Cartoony fighting goodness.""

This is probably the most asked question, when it comes to a series...""Do I need to play the predecessors in order to play this game?""

The answer is, most absolutely, NO! This game can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of your familiarity of the series. And get this, you don't need to be a ""professional gamer"" either. You can choose the level of your enemies (given they're AI), with level 1 being the easiest, and 9 being the hardest.
You get a grand variety of characters to choose from, way more than in the previous installments ( I think I'd have trouble ever turning back to those games now!) Each of these characters have unique attacks (none are the same),Some characters are faster, some are heavier, and some are hard to hit! It's up to you to pick your favorites!
Do you have a favorite character, but aren't fond of their stats? No worry, you can now fully customize their attacks, equipment, and powers, so you can play as your favorites and enjoy it too! (Think of Donkey Kong with Sonic's speed!) Unfortunately, you can't bring these modified characters into online battles (which makes me sad...)

But I digress!

Classic Mode:
True to it's name, Classic Mode was there from the very beginning!  Fight enemies in the order to get the the GRAND FINALE, Masterhand!

There are many other things to do besides kicking the crap out of people, such as: ""challenges,"" where you complete certain tasks in order to receive rewards! You can also enter mini-games, where you hit a sandbag with a bat, and see how far you can make it go, and a similar game where you toss a bomb, making it explode at a certain angle for more points.

You also have Smash Run, MY ULTIMATE FAVORITE!

In smash-run, you basically run around collecting ""power-ups,"" which increase your stats! Each stat. has it's own designated item (a boot for speed, wing for jumping power, etc). The more you get of one item, the faster that certain stat will go up! It's not all that easy though, as there are enemies waiting around every corner, readying to attack you! You'll lose stat. items whenever you get K.O.'d. It's actually quite difficult (at least for me...haha), and may bring out the worst in you....XD!

Throughout the game, you can also collect trophies, where you can view in your ""album."" Each depict characters from several video games. Be sure to read each trophy description!

The only downfall this game has (that actually doesn't bother me), is that the Online feature lags (sometimes terribly at times). I know this has been a HUGE issue with some, so I thought it'd bring it up. It doesn't happen often to me, but I tend to just ""go with the flow,"" when it happens.

--Mega Man--
Oh man, the Blue Bomber NEEDED this to happen! The poor guy's been shoved off to the curb since 2010, and the only Mega Man-related thing that Capcom did was toss his horrendous box art counterpart into the PS3/Vita version of Street Fighter x Tekken. That just goes to show how much respect the company has for its own flagship franchise anymore. With that said, Nintendo, please consider buying Capcom! We all know you guys would give each of its series justice.
(Three Mega Man games you should play: Mega Man 2, Mega Man 9, and Mega Man X)

--Sonic--
Welcome back, buddy! Unlike Mega Man, Sonic has actually been doing well since 2010, as Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations were pretty great games! Sonic Lost World kinda took a hit, but Sonic Boom is looking out to be a pretty neat and interesting take on the series. With that said, Sonic's appearance in this game is just as radical as his Smash debut in Brawl!
(Three Sonic games you should play: Sonic Mega Collection - because it's hard to put one Genesis Sonic on here -, Sonic Adventure, Sonic Colors)

--Pac-Man--
YES! OH MY GOD YEEESSS!!!!!!!
You guys have NO idea how exciting it is to see Pac-Man make it in! I am the biggest Pac-Man fan I know, and have been since when I was very little, back when I only stuck with a few game franchises (including Pac and Mario). I've went beyond the arcade originals and played other titles in the series such as the Pac-Man World series, among many others. Unfortunately, ever since Pac-Man World 3 came out in 2005, I've been clamoring for a fourth, and never got to see it exist since. In fact, once again. 2010 was where Pac-Man really started going downhill. Sure the mobile games have been consistently great, but the mainstream entries end up falling flat often. This includes the whole Ghostly Adventures crap that's been going on on television and in video game form. When it was announced that Namco would be helping with this new Smash Bros, I hoped for Pac-Man to be in it right away. As months went on, and as other characters got their due, I was losing my hopes. Then I thought ""Sigh...I guess it wasn't meant to be. Even then, it would probably be his stupid Ghostly Adventures self"" HOLY CRAP THEY BEAT THE ODDS! Pac is BACK, in all of his retro, Pac-Man World/Land-y glory! I wish there were more references to more of the dot muncher's platforming escapades, but I'm perfectly fine with Pac-Man as he is! He single-handedly completed this roster for me. There's literally no other character I'd want to see make it in Smash Bros.
(Three Pac-Man games you should play: Pac-Man, Pac-Man Adventures in Time, Pac-Man World 2)

Anyway, enough with the greetings. Let's cut to the GAME review.
In a similar fashion to Paper Mario, Super Smash Bros.'s fourth installment paves its way to a handheld for the series's first time. Prior to the game's release, the closest I was ever able to get to a portable Smash Bros. experience was.....Cartoon Network Punch Time Explosion. But hey! A portable Smash Bros. was something I've been waiting for for a long time to see even happen, so of course this was a great surprise! And unlike Paper Mario, nothing was tragically ruined, as the four-player fighting mayhem is as fun and frantic as it's always been! In fact, the series's fighting rounds and not-so-lengthy game modes actually help Super Smash Bros. fit portable gaming like a glove!

This game does exactly what you expect it to: Provide everything that made the previous games work, and add more on top. In fact, the game feel is actually a good balance between Melee's skill-and-quick-pace style and Brawl's chaos! The characters all control remarkably well, and while there's still stuff like Assist Trophies and Final Smashes, the combat feels tighter than it was in Brawl. Plus, there's no tripping. Thank god.

If you are new to Nintendo's definitive fighting franchise, let me fill you in: You pick from one of dozens of Nintendo characters (and the three guest characters I discussed about above), and then you duke it out with other characters on interactive fighting arenas mostly based on existing Nintendo franchises and games with a few interesting small gimmicks to each one. The WarioWare stage is easily my favorite gimmick stage, because you get to play microgames as you're fighting! And you even get rewarded for winning a microgame! But of course, if you want a clean fight without such things, the game does have plenty of options for plain stages and item settings. Items are almost to this game as they are in Mario Kart, though, adding a new flavor to your battles every chance they get to shine, but you still have to use your own wits to conquer matches. The beauty of Super Smash Bros.'s fighting mechanics is that unlike just about every other fighting game ever, you use a button and/or a direction to pull off your attack. Combine that with platforming elements and you've found yourself with a unique and fantastic cartridge.

I haven't even mentioned the game modes yet!
For the single-player ride, you have the traditional Classic mode (Think an arcade fighter's structure, but with randomized Smash Bros. battles), All-Star mode (Fight every character in the roster), and Stadium events (Such as Home-Run Contest. Yes. It's exactly as it sounds). Sadly, Event Matches are absent from this game, but the other modes have seen some interesting changes. Classic mode, for example, lets you decide which path to travel, resulting in a different fight than what you may have gone to otherwise. There's also the new Smash Run mode, which has your character pummel through a massive level, killing enemies for stats and upgrades. When the time runs out, that's when you must pile up as many KOs as possible. It's actually a nice, quicker diversion of Brawl's full-on Subspace Emissary adventure mode, but I will miss the latter definitely.

As for multiplayer....Well, you all know where this is going! Super Smash Bros. has been a party favorite since the first game's debut in 1999! Granted, being that this iteration is on a handheld console, this will mean that you guys need to have your own 3DS systems. Some may prefer sticking with sitting on the couch and playing together on one screen, but personally, I don't care what I do to play Smash Bros. with buddies. As long as we have fun out of it, then it's just as awesome as picking Smash fights on the couch! If you don't have friends active anytime soon, though, don't panic! Super Smash Bros. is jam-packed with online functionality as well, letting you play against three other people for fun, another person for a legit ranking, or spectate and bet virtual coins on people already duking it out. Being that I do online races in Mario Kart 7 and race in Sonic Lost World, OF COURSE I'm addicted to this game's online battles!!

Just...All I can say is...I wholeheartedly recommend this game. Even though the 3DS is supposedly not quite as powerful as the Nintendo Gamecube, Super Smash Bros. really tends to say otherwise. It is that much of a lovingly crafted quality title that I wouldn't hesitate to call one of the best games ever released on the Nintendo 3DS. Thank you, Namco, for redeeming yourselves, and thank you Nintendo & HAL/Sora for making Super Smash Bros. happen as it did.",10-06-2014

Pros

- Full Smash Bros experience on a handheld
- Beautiful graphics at 60 frames
- Tons of content
- Controls great even with the 3DS limitations
- Better gameplay than Brawl. Less floaty physics and more balance.

Cons

- Online is terrible if not played with friends with good connections
- Some new modes fall flat on their face
- Less songs than Brawl and WiiU versions (Cart size an issue I presume)
- At times hard to keep track of the action

Even with the cons this game is still extremely fun and impressive for the system it's on. The Online sucking is the biggest con here and again I might contribute this to the hardware more than anything else.

In fact things like cart space, controls, online, screen size are hardware related and not so much faults of the game so i'll cheat and give the game a pass here. Especially since it's really the full on smash experience in handheld and not watered down.",10-06-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,5,"If you own a 3DS and DON'T buy this game, you're doing yourself a disservice","This is not only the first Smash game on a portable system, but it's also a really strong showing on the platform, making this the best Smash game yet.  It's still the same game we played before but with a few new features, characters, and game modes that keep this game fun to play.

First of all, the graphics aren't what I expected, and I'm glad that is so.  When you look at screenshots, the game looks like some of the worst cell shading ever, and I was also worried that the game would run at 30 FPS, instead of the 60 FPS that I knew the series for.  That being said, the graphics are console quality, the outlines aren't that noticeable, though you can change this in the options if you want, and, thank you Nintendo for this, they kept the 60 FPS, and all that was from the demo alone.

The controls work well with not many complaints.  Everything is where they should be, and the buttons are also customizable in case if you want to change things up.  The only problem I have is, since I used the stick for jumping since Super Smash Bros for the Nintendo 64, jumping with the circle pad proves to be a pain since you have to jump by moving it straight up.  Because of this, I turned off the pad-jumping and started using the Y button, which was the first time I did that on a Smash game.  Other than that, the controls work well.

For everything else, there are a good amount of features in this game.  For the first time, you can customize the characters in the game and make a Mii Fighter, whether it be a gunner, brawler, or a blade master, in which both of these features are interesting in their own right.  There's also a new game mode for the 3DS version of Smash called Smash-Run; however, I really don't like this mode.  This mode requires you to run through a labyrinth to find chest to boost your stats before going into a race or a final fight.  The problem is that you'll more than likely be unprepared, and this proves even more problematic when there is a screen filled with enemies, in which you may be knocked out quicker than you can find a chest.  This is also one of the few game modes on the front page of the menu, with all the others stuffed under ""Games & More.""  One game mode you'll like be stuck in, if not Smash mode, is the Classic Mode, which has an interesting little change to it.  You decide how much you bet to change the intensity of the matches, the more the tougher but with better rewards.  After placing your bet, you will be put in a route map, where you can choose who you want to fight as you approach the forks in the road, and before you're match begins, you spin a roulette to determine what reward you'll get, or if you get a reward at all.  In a way, this keeps the mode feeling fresh.  There's also a good amount of new characters, including names such as Little Mac from Punch-Out, easily one of my favorites, the Villager from Animal Crossing, the Duck Hunt Duo from, where else, Duck Hunt, and Greninja from Poke'mon X and Y just to name a few.

If you have a 3DS, this a must have for the Nintendo portable.  This is a great game that should not be missed, and it should hold most over until the Wii U version comes.  Plus, it's Smash Bros. to go, and I don't see a problem with that.  Only thing that could make this better is if progress is transferable to the Wii U version.",10-05-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,5,Smashing Fun!,"When Nintendo announced that the fourth entry in the Super Smash Bros. series would not only be on Wii U, but also on the Nintendo 3DS, people were hyped. Playing Smash Bros. on the go was like a dream come true! Gamers everywhere counted down the days to Super Smash Bros. For Nintendo 3DS. And now, the day has come where we can play Super Smash Bros. anytime, anywhere. But, is Super Smash Bros. For Nintendo 3DS just a placeholder until the Wii U version comes out, or will people still be smashing on their 3DS's for years to come?

GAMEPLAY: The Smash Bros. series has a trademark fighting system unique from other fighting games. Rather than deplete health bars, players attack each other trying to raise their percentages and knock their opponents off the arena. This makes it so that combat relies less on combos and more on how well the player is able to maneuver themselves around the many colorful locales Super Smash Bros. For Nintendo 3DS has to offer. There are also many items that can be picked up and used on others, such as the Smash Ball, which returns from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Smash-Bros-Brawl/dp/B000FQ9R4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>. This frantic gameplay transitions well to the 3DS, and although it can sometimes be hard to find yourself in the game's vast locales, you can easily put a reticle around your character to quickly find out where you are. Not only that, but the game runs at a solid 60 frames per second, just like the previous games, so players that prefer to play in 3D will have nothing to worry about.

CHARACTERS: One of the main selling points of Smash Bros. is that it crosses over many of Nintendo's franchises. Naturally, with each new game, people anticipate their favorite Nintendo characters joining the fray. Those people will be satisfied since characters such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Punch-Out-s/dp/B001TOQ8K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Punch-Out's</a>&nbsp;Little Mac,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-Crossing-s/dp/B0053BCML6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal Crossing's</a>&nbsp;Villager,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-Galaxy-s/dp/B000FQ9QVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario Galaxy's</a>&nbsp;Rosalina, and more appear in this game. There are even unexpected characters, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xenoblade-Chronicles-s/dp/B007RNWUC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xenoblade Chronicles's</a>&nbsp;Shulk, and Pac-Man himself! Add in some equally unexpected unlockable characters, and you have yourself an all-star cast that's bound to satisfy any Nintendo fan's tastes! But, there are some people that would like to see some unexpected people such as real life celebrities and anime characters in the game. This is addressed with the Mii Fighter feature. In this mode, you can take a Mii from your 3DS's Mii Maker and add them into the game with one of three fighting styles: Brawler, Swordfighter, and Gunner. You can also give them four different special moves, attach equipment to change up their stats, and even dress them up in outfits! So, if you ever wanted to see yourself or your friend in Smash Bros., now you have the chance!

MODES: Super Smash Bros. For Nintendo 3DS also boasts a variety of modes. There are the series staples, such as Multi-Man Smash, Home Run Contest, and Classic Mode, along with all new modes such as Target Blast and Smash Run. Target Blast has you pummeling a bomb followed by launching it in order to destroy as many targets as possible (Think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angry-Birds/dp/B009SHV6CC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angry Birds</a>), while Smash Run has you journeying through a sizable maze collecting power-ups and fighting enemies from various Nintendo games in order to prepare for a challenge with your opponents, which can range from your run-of-the-mill fight, to a race to the finish, or a Multi-Man Smash. Despite Smash Run not being online compatible, it still proves to be a fun, albeit a bit challenging, addition to Smash Bros.. Speaking of online, you can also play online via Nintendo Network with players from around the world. With Brawl, the first game in the series to feature online play, the matches online were often uncomfortable and filled with lag. Fortunately, this has been mostly fixed in Super Smash Bros. For Nintendo 3DS. Matches are now smooth, and there's now a variety of modes you can play online. For Fun has players fighting normal matches on nearly every stage, while For Glory has players fighting competitive matches on flat Omega Form variants of the stages. These modes can provide a casual, fun match, or a heated one-on-one for the pleasure of victory.

SOUND: Like I mentioned above, Super Smash Bros. crosses over a variety of video game franchises, so naturally, each stage has music from each game. The music selection featured is well chosen, and each tune fits the stage it plays on. You have the classic Waka-Wakas on Pac-Man's stage, along with the adventurous music on the Zelda stages. Even better, the game features a Sound Test mode where you can listen to each track on its own. You can even insert a pair of headphones into the 3DS and listen to the music while the 3DS is in sleep mode, meaning that Super Smash Bros. For Nintendo 3DS also acts a bit like an iPod.

FINAL VERDICT: For years, people have been anticipating Super Smash Bros. For Nintendo 3DS, and I'm very happy to say that it delivers. The gameplay is solid, the modes are fun and addictive, online plays like a breeze, and the music is incredible. Nintendo has knocked (Or, should I say, Smashed) it out of the park once again. I can only hope that the Wii U will be even more of an experience than this.",10-05-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,5,Yes it is ALL THAT and you don't need a bag of chips!!!,"Anyone who has ever played a title in this fine series knows what to expect.  If you've never played one though, let me tell you a few reasons this game is a superb 3ds game purchase.  I enjoy playing SSB but I've never been really good at it.  That's ok because you can fully adjust each combatant's ability so you can fight against a weak, extremely strong AI or any level in between.  You can build skills and confidence without it ever being too frustrating.  Do realize though that this game will track your every win and loss and a plethora of other statistics.  Don't get discouraged if you're new to the franchise or just aren't the ""greatest"" at it....you will get better and better as you play.  There are TONS of characters/fighters available from the beginning...over 40.  Lot's of vibrant and great level designs.  For some peculiar reason I have enjoyed the pictochat arena/stage best of all with the Pokmon ones coming in closely behind.  And Living Room!!  If you also own a Wii U and you can't decide which version to get, I considered it and decided to go ahead and get this one now as it is really just awesome to own this game in a portable format to play in small chunks on the go, lunch break, etc....it is one of the most robust games I've ever played on a handheld and the gameplay modes and character options are phenomenal, so it is not a ""lesser version"" of a console game.  It is very full, very customizable....very beautiful, just one of the best games I have ever put my hands on since Atari days.  Creating Mii fighters is awesome too....how much fun to fight your ""friend"" as a Mii and a Charizard at the same time while the cute Nintendog plays in the back ground.  The stage designs are all so good and effect the ""match"" so differently.  This game is worth 40 bucks any day of the week!!!  I do agree that extended play is uncomfortable for my hands and fingers but that's easy to fix by taking breaks.  I also put a Nerf cover on my 3ds, many games ago and that has helped a lot. **I am playing it on a 3dsXL and have no problem seeing/playing, dealing with all the chaos on the screen at this size.  It's just never going to be as comfortable as a hand controller for the console games. You will certainly get your money's worth with this game and then later, when the Wii U version comes out if you want that also, this one will interact with it ""somehow"" (not completely disclosed by Nintendo) but I understand having this copy in your 3ds will enable your 3ds to be used as an additional remote on the Wii U version.  THAT would be pretty cool.  AND, Nintendo....you did a great job on fan service.  All the nods to prior games.....oh wow and the Gameboy stage......if this reads like an excited kid wrote it, that's exactly what I feel like.  This game brings back all the wonderment I experienced with games of the 70s, 80s and early 90s.  Nintendo has done it again.  Watch out for that evil Villager.....now, Get Your PIKACHU ON!!!!!",10-05-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,5,Get Smashing!!,"I was looking forward to this game a lot but not trying to get my expectations to high seeing as it is the first time for a smash game on the 3ds. Glad to say I was pretty accurate, but it was a little better than I thought. My only gripes are I cannot change the movement from the circle pad to the Dpad which I was really hoping for (if you know of a way to do this that I missed PLEASE let me know). My grips on the pad are worn down so my thumb slides off easily, so this may be a personal thing. My other issue is the lag of online play. My internet is pretty good and I generally have a low ping, with a high download and upload so I don't believe that to be the problem. Also, I had my phone turned off like some people recommend. Regular play felt quite smooth through every session. I had no issues with any setting, amount of players, or items that slowed down my system or felt out of place from my play so far.

As for everything else I was very happy. There are a good amount of features and content especially for a 3ds game. Classic, all star, home run, and a few other game modes are back along with a few others. Smash run is a blast and I'm going to be playing a lot of it with my friends and family. I feel Nintendo is great at enhancing older ideas with new flare and this is no exception. Like I said, classic mode is back but you can choose between 3 paths... and you can change the difficulty based on how much gold you would like to spend. Not only that but at the end credit sequence you have a different mini game to complete, and I find this one particularly fun! There is also a new trophy rush game that I find entertaining as well. With all of the great modes you will have to see for yourself!

The character roster has grown immensely, though I felt a lot more came unlocked than in previous games. I personally enjoy unlocking them but I was happy to be able to jump in with my favorites right off the bat as well. They have a nifty customization feature that allows you to change your Nintendo fighters stats AND abilities if you desire. The ability changes are alterations of there normal ones with some enhanced effects or small differences in general. A neat idea as you can pit your Mario up against a friends Mario and see who's the better plumber :).

In battle items are growing more interesting as time goes by. There are so many new ones I can't possibly name them all (not that i can remember them anyway) but a few that stand out are the addition of the Master Ball which very often holds a legendary Pokemon in it, a 1up flag that either gives you a point in time battle or a stock in stock battle, and the gust bellows(I think) which pushes people around like Mario's water cannon.

I am sure i missed a lot of stuff in my review and made a few mistakes, however I highly recommend this game to anyone with a 3ds that loves to smash. Just for reference I have the fire emblem: awakening special edition 3ds. My brother has a 3ds XL and both systems seem to play about the same, except of course he has a bigger screen",10-05-2014

I would never have imagined that a SSB game with impressive visuals would ever be able to run a consistent 60 fps on a somewhat under-powered handheld. All things considered, this is a definite improvement over Brawl in almost every way (except for the lack of a level editor, but that really isn't a big deal), and I have been playing it almost continuously since it went live at midnight on October 3rd.

There is a decent level of variety among the levels, although nothing too spectacular, and a large cast of playable characters with a variety of interesting play-styles. There are a decent number of game modes available here, with normal Smash, Smash Run, a classic Smash mode, various mini-games, and of course local and online multiplayer. And, of course, there are countless trophies to collect, each one describing the character, item, or situation they represent. It's a veritable treasure mine of Nintendo trivia on its own and makes the effort you expend to collect the trophies feel worthwhile.

The online, of course, has two modes: for fun and for glory. I like that they took the time to create a mode specifically for more competitive Smashers, but you'll still find some fierce talent in both modes. An interesting innovation is that you spectate online matches and actually bet gold on who is going to win a match. The experience online is incredibly spotty, however, and can often lag so severely as to make a match unplayable. When it works, though, it works well enough, and it is still an improvement over Brawl's online multiplayer. Hopefully the Wii U version will fix this blemish on an otherwise stellar title.

Kid Icarus: Uprising's difficulty scale is back with this game, and the risk/reward mechanic is beautifully integrated into the main gameplay

The game is strong and impressive, but not perfect. The online multiplayer is incredibly hit-or-miss, and some people have even reported minor local multiplayer lag. The mini-game diversions are mostly forgettable and most people won't spend more than a few tries with them, I imagine. There are challenges here, but they're so easy to complete that I've already filled out 3/4 of the list in the small amount of time I've owned the game. These flaws don't take away from the solid core game, however. If you like Smash at all, this is one of its best entries, and will likely only be outclassed when its HD sibling is released soon.

PS: The game lacks any kind of Miiverse integration, presently, because the game is working the system so hard that it doesn't have the resources to manage anything extra outside of the game. I won't count this as a negative. I'll trade social features for smooth 60 fps gameplay any day.",10-04-2014

I honestly thought is was going to be a lousy port that would be no fun at all. I am so happy to be proven wrong. Since everything about this game is great I will keep this short and point out my only two gripes.

1. When the camera pans out to see the whole map (this happens when certain items are being used) it can a bit hard to keep track of whats going on at times. It not terrible and it hardly ruins the game but it can be off-putting at times.

2. The Smash Bros. Brawl theme is not included. I love that song and not having it is a crime!

Not just fr their video games, but the longevity of the characters from start to finish. That has shown itself from Mario to Zelda, all the way to classics like Donkey Kong and Star Fox. But overall, it is the longevity and appeal that has shown even with companies like Sony, Sega and Microsoft trying their hands to match what Nintendo has done, it is the classics that have stood the test of time. It nearly has been twenty years since Nintendo has unveiled the Nintendo 64, and great definitive titles like Super Mario 64, The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time and Star Fox 64 have been the definitive templates of gaming history. Super Smash Brothers has also been a massive part of the definitive, influential system. When it came out, it really grabbed the gamers' hearts and controllers. It has had great sequels that have been worth the money, Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Gamecube, Brawl for the Wii in 2008 as well. Now, the definitive fighter is taking the gaming world on the go, and it is worth it.

Super Smash Brothers for the Nintendo 3DS really shows that Nintendo still has some lengths, considering the lag of strong games for the 3DS the past year. It is a great game as you take on fighters from Mario, Yoshi, Bowser, and all your favorite Nintendo classics and try to fight your way to the top, as you fight, kick, and punch through so many levels of the Nintendo Universe, to master and defeat the great Master Hand and score through so many great levels of fun. Graphically, it definitely holds up, and the controls are strong and remain tight. What also holds up in the game is the great online gaming as you can also fight with others well through the Nintendo streetpass, and clubhouse worldwide gameplay. The game also has new characters who have also joined on the smashing fun with Rosalina from Super Mario Galaxy and the classic Pac-Man chomping his way to the top of the leaderboard. The sound also is just as strong as the console greats that have been with the Nintendo systems before.

Overall, what you get with Super Smash Brothers for the Nintendo 3DS is a great game that isn't just fun, it stands tall with the great 3DS titles from before that have been definitive from Super Mario 3D Land, Mario Kart 7 and Yoshi's New Island. It really is a fantastic game that holds up so well in so many ways, graphically, control and enjoyment. If you have never owned a Nintendo 3DS title before, this is absolutely one I recommend you go to. For anyone that has followed Super Smash Brothers before, this is definitely up to the best that Nintendo has shown before in great games.

My only nitpick is the occasional difficulty making out your character on the small 3ds screen. Not a big problem, especially if you have the 3dsXL.

I've been enjoying this series since the first release on N64, however there's never been a better time to join the brawl. If you're a fan of Nintendo franchises, party games, action games, or just having a good time on the go, do yourself a favor and get this game!",10-03-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Nintendo-3DS/dp/B00DD0B1R0?th=1,9,Video Games,Super Smash Bros. - Nintendo 3DS,4.7,5,Its good to be the King,"Finally after much delay - the King of smash is back.  The cast is larger, the action faster, and the AI smarter.  The ability to make your Mii's into fighters is fun, and their moves are as strong as the regular characters.  I would suggest using the training until you get used to the main controls, but when you do you can move very quickly.  I love this game and it is a strong addition to the 3ds library and when the wiiu version comes out make sure you port your mii fighter to it as well.",10-03-2014

YES!!,"If you've played Smash before, you know what you're getting.  This game is just as addicting as the others in the series.  Online matches are fun, haven't experienced any lag so far.  The only (small) complaint I have is the controls.  They take some getting used to if you're used to playing with a gamecube controller.  Thankfully, you can map the buttons to your liking.  When the new 3DS comes out with the extra shoulder button I think I'll be happier with the controls.

*UPDATE 10/5*

I've played a good amount of matches online, and about 1/4 of the matches are laggy.  Most are just annoying slow downs for anywhere from 1/2 a second to 5 seconds, but some are actually game pausing where the smash logo pops up in the lower right hand corner and loads.  The lag is frustrating to say the least.  It only happens in about a quarter of the matches, but it's there.",10-03-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,"Amazing game, ignore the the negative reviews","First off the game is amazing and more fun then i antcipated tons of varity of weapons,maps and setups. I have not had this much fun playing a game in years since modern warfare 2 and how convienet its made by the same developers. The game is fast paced and action packed there's an occasial sniper on a rooftop but nothing like the newar cod games i don't nearly get as frustrated. I do enjoy dropping titans on enemies and roaming around in them but for me the gun on gun is amazing when your jumping off rooftops and wall running mowing down enemies is sick. I do have a bone to pick though with sony fanboys why do you guys always feel the need to come and bash xbox products if there not that good and you don't care why are you here. If you don't want it why are you guys trying to have petitions signed for games like titanfall to come to the ps4. Lets get the straight to i own and like both systems but enjoy mhy xbox more but you don't see me bashing the ps4 so get a life and stop trolling its annoying, most of the 1 star reviews for xbox products as of late come from sony fanboys. i hate using that term to cuz i am a fan of ps4 as well but ive seen and heard enough bashing from ps4 fans rate the product if you played it and wanna give people your insight don't leave negative reviews because your i don't know scared who knows. I apologize for getting off topic and i just want you all to know get this game you won't be sorry if awesome.",03-11-2014

its way better than cod. You are able to call in Titans and shoot everything up. The case of the game is so
unappealing its just some randon guy sitting on a titans arm for some reason. I MEAN HELLO, you are in battle
so why the heck are you sitting outside of the titan? They should have made the title smaller too. So thats
my review, thanks for reading and i hope i helped.

Bye ;D

PS: You need xbox live in order to play this game, which is a huge rip off btw. Oh and its the only game in History
that does not have a single player. Xbox should consider changing their box color to black. green is ugly, nobody likes
Green. Please like my review, i am really trying to help people. Ok bye now. Ohhh and Eminems new album is awesomeeeee
Its better than his other ones, encore and Relapes are horrible compared to the marshall mathers lp 2. I don't like the
fact that he changed his hair back to blonde though. Oh and what the heck is Respawn entertainment? is that EAs new name
or something? if so they should change it back, because ""EA"" sounds better. and this game should be 20 bucks. Because of
no single player.",03-11-2014

However, I think they did brought a great idea, but they executed badly. For instance, whether you win or lose, its all the same ending except there is an losing version and a winning version. The story however, is confusing because they won't tell you what starts the story because it FREEZES in the middle of the intro.

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,Call of Duty meets Transformers,"Being mediocre at the Call of Duty games can get frustrating. All the equalizers in the game are based on kill streaks, which once one falls behind they typically get left behind (pirate code). The great part of this game is no matter how bad one is doing, every three minute, give or take, you get to call down a giant robot and run around and wreak havoc.

Mixed in with a bunch of unlockables for load outs (similar to call of duty) for both your person and Titan (giant robotic killing machine) this game is a lot of fun to play. The only place it falls short is the campaign. In a typical unreal tech fashion they neglected to make a true campaign. Instead of a story you just play the computer in multiplayer games and win or lose you move on to the next. More of a single player mode than a campaign. With so much potential for an awesome story, it would have been nice if they bothered to make one.",08-14-2015
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,3,"Slightly different FPS with titans, double jump, etc - no real campaign/storyline","Bought this at full price, which was probably not the best idea. Storyline is shaky at best, but if you ever enjoyed mech warrior games and FPS you'll definitely enjoy this. It is pretty fast paced and there are lots of strategy that can be used between your titan and being on foot. Probably much more fun and easier to win matches if you are playing with a group of friends. When compared to a lot of FPS games these days this game doesn't have too large of matches (8 people per?). It was entertaining, but as time passes this will probably be a small blip in the xbox one game library.",08-13-2015
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,"Probably my favorite FPS ever, quite honestly","This is probably my favorite FPS of all-time. I was a diehard COD4 fan and less so Modern Warfare 2. From then on, I lost interest in the COD series. However, this is akin back to the COD4 days but with a lot more to it. The game is incredibly well-balanced between the titans and the pilots and there's never a shortage of things to do in the multiplayer. I did NOT expect to like this game as much as I did and I'm glad I got it on sale for 15 bucks because it's proving to be one of the most worthwhile gaming purchases I've ever made. I cannot wait for Titanfall 2 and I will now be preordering it the first chance I get!",08-06-2015

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,Titanfall COD or Halo with extra bonuses,"When I received Titanfall I was pleasantly surprised to find that all of the DLC was at the time FREE!!!!
This game is so fun,it has all of the action of a 1st person shooter with multiplayer mode but then add in the Titans and it just takes the game to a different  level of blissful chaos.
Wall running and hanging as a pilot or double jumping from rooftop to rooftop you find your pilot as a more advanced and agile  version of what you wold expect from a Call of Duty character, that is not a knock on COD I am a day one adopter of COD as an avid player of every COD game even from before the days of multiplayer game play.
Simply put Titanfall takes all the things you love about COD or Halo and then takes it up a notch with the use of your Titan and other perks like burn cards that put an extra ability for your pilot at your fingertips  after each time you get taken out in a match, only 3 burn cards per match though so make sure you don't die often.
The maps are massive and the environments are majorly interactive, zip lines and tunnels all over the place.
Campaign mode is also multiplayer a spin on things but I like it, the weapons are cool and you get a chance to know them all because in order to REGENERATE , or PRESTIGE as we are used to it being called, you must pass several challenges with different pilot and Titan weapons.
As you progress you earn different Titan insignia as well as the ability to purchase different packs of burn cards as well as different voices for your OS in your Titan,my favorite is Sid.
There are plenty of different  game modes I find in order to level up the quickest Frontier Defense is the way to go but in order to REGENERATE you will have to play a different mode because requirements always include a number of pilot kills with different weapons.
Titanfall is a great game and I look forward to future editions  to what is sure to become a popular multiplayer 1st person shooter the likes of COD or Halo",07-16-2015

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,Not Bad,"I owned call of duty advanced warfare on ps4 before ever getting an xbox one.
This was the first game I bought for it.
And though I had read criticism on advanced warfare about stealing pretty much everything that made titanfall great, I couldn't weigh in on it until I played this.
Now that I have, I must say it is absolutely true.
Everything from the dash to the double jump and cloaking present in advanced warfare is present here.
Aside from all this titanfall is in a league of its own.
It manages to keep the genre fresh.
The controls respond nicely.
The only thing missing to make it a complete package is a solid story mode.
Instead you get buts and pieces of story through the multiplayer matches.
Nothing great.
At $20 I would recommend this title as a buy.
If you're looking for a good story I would recommend renting this first.
With most people I know this game is either a hit or miss.

About the hackers...I'm starting to think the game industry secretly promotes hacking and boosting after a game has been out for awhile.  By doing this, it frustrates/drives the gamers to buy new products being released.  The hackers then appear on the new product and the cyclic process starts all over.  The only true winner is the gaming industry.  This process IMO has ruined the best FPS games like Modern Warfare 2/3 (Which I would still be playing).",02-06-2015

It definitely wasn't the best at first as it got boring quickly. With time though respawn has made this a great game. The variety of game modes they created. The extra things they added such as ranks. The updates to make the game smoother and better such as matchmaking. The game has over time become really fun and great and with the DLC there's a lot to do. So many game modes on many maps its fun. Definitely a fun game to just turn on after work and spend a hour just blowing away folk and get off. Rely that's what I use it for and its great.

The XBL sale where the Deluxe Edition was only $12.50 made me decide to give TitanFall a shot, and I'm glad I did. This reminds me some of the Call of Duty games, from modes and leveling up. The Mech aspect is pretty cool and I dig how your pilot ejects out when it's nearly destroyed. Graphics are decent, but not top notch for XBO. All in all it's a fun game in spurts, much like COD. The lack of any true single player and less than stellar graphics take off 1 star, 4/5.",01-31-2015

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,Great Multiplayer Experience,"I liked COD Modern warfare games and since I knew the same developers were making this game and I liked the trailer, I bought this. Here is what I think.

****************************************************************PROS*********************************************************************************
-Great FPS/Titan gameplay: Gameplay is the number one reason you should buy this game. It is a mixture of FPS like COD but in addition to that you can wall run, double jump, use stealth but most importantly play as Titan. Playing as a pilot (simple FPS) and as a Titan, both have their advantages and disadvantages. So plenty of tactics to explore between two types of play. If you become an advanced player, then you can both control your Titan while playing as a pilot(human). A must experience.

-Incredible graphics/sounds: This one goes without saying. Anyone who has seen the trailer can tell this game has great graphics and sounds. Little things like Titans falling from the sky are very well done. Makes the play very enthralling.

-Variety of multiplayer modes: Like other FPS, there are variety of modes. I have had this one for almost a month and still haven't gotten around to exploring all of these modes.

-Upgrades: As you play more, you earn more points and you can customize and upgrade both your pilot and the Titan. Makes the gameplay very addictive.

****************************************************************CONS*********************************************************************************
-Lack of a good single player campaign/story: It has a very generic horde single player mode. A great concept like this could really have used a good single player story mode. But unfortunately it is simply not there. I really hope developers include it the next time.

****************************************************************CONCLUSION*********************************************************************************
I wouldn't buy this game at full price as it doesn't have a single player mode. But now that the price has lowered, I recommend buying it and experiencing the amazing multiplayer experience.",12-13-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,"Not Earth Shattering, But Fun and Refreshing","This was the first game I purchased for my Xbox One and it did not disappoint.  For those who have played Call of Duty, the game will feel familiar, however, there is enough that sets it apart that the experience feels fresh.  Perhaps the biggest thing that sets this game apart are the Titans, which one gets access to after a certain period has passed during the match.  The Titan customization is good, but simple and not very deep.  It would have been cooler to see more classes, however, there are enough primary and secondary weapons options to keep it interesting.  Overall, the weapons and experience has been really balanced so far.  I am not the greatest when it comes to death matches on FPS games, however, I find that I rarely finish near the bottom.  Thus, the game is easy for the casual fan to pick up and not get too discouraged.  I also really like the statistics feature that records pretty much all of the statistics for the game that you can imagine.  You can use this feature to find out which is your best weapon and what maps you do best on.  All of this said, the game is nothing Earth shattering, but is incredibly fun and refreshing for those FPS fans looking for something a little different.  I especially recommend the game now that it has had a price cut.  That said, a few things keep this game from being a 5-star experience.

Summary:

Pros:

Great Graphics
Excellent game play and controls
Titan feature a welcomed and fresh addition
Fun to pick up and play
Statistics feature
Balanced weapons

Cons/Complaints:

Could use more customization
Not enough death match game modes, pretty basic overall
Some issues with screen tearing
No split-screen option

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,2,NO Single Player Mode!  Read before buying!,"I have mixed feelings about this game and am thinking about selling it after owning it for only one day.  I would definitely say this game is not for everyone.  I'm not the type of person who wants to play online with random people.  I want to either play alone or with a friend when we are together (CO-OP) and not online.  Sure, I've played multiplayer in games like Halo and others, and it's fun for a while, but it gets old.  It's not something I perosnally would do more than once or twice a month, at most.

If you are looking for a multiplayer shooter (with no campaign) this is the game for you.  The entire game is the is like the multiplayer from the Halo series.  I'm not talking about the story mode as Co-Op, I mean the capture the flag, etc multiplayer modes.  That's right, there's NO single player, or Co-Op, from what I can find. The entire game is you and random people playing the ""story"" mode.  I say it like that because it doesn't seem like much of a story.

I loved the tutorial and it got me pumped up for the game.  The weapons, titans, and moves (wall jumps and more) are super cool.  Then I spent 5-10 min trying to figure out where the campaign mode was and googling how to find it.  Sigh.  I found out that there was no real campaign mode. The only way to play a campaign is to play it multiplayer , and it seemed pretty crappy to me.  I wouldn't have bought the game if I knew this.  In fact, I'm beating the game as I write this review, because I don't really need to do anything to beat a mission, I can just let the rest of my team do it.  I have no real impact on finishing the mission.

In the multiplayer campaign I couldn't tell who was on my team and who was the enemy.  By the time I figured it out, I was dead.  It's not like a single player game where you may die once or twice in a mission, I am CONSTANTLY dying.  I don't know who's good and who's bad, the objective isn't entirely clear, and to make it worse, you can turn invisible, so even it you do know who's on your team, someone can turn invisible and kill you without you having a clue as to what's going on.  Again, this might be a fun party activity to play with friends as a multiplayer, but that is NOT how a campaign should be run.

Oh, it gets better.  Since it's online only, you have to be connected to the internet the whole time.  No problem right?  I've never had internet issues, but during the middle of a mission, I mysteriously got booted out with a ""Lost Connection to Server"" message.  Can you imagine that happening while trying to beat a game?  Incredibly frustrating.  Then when I log back in, I'm playing a different mission (because you can't choose which level/mission you want to play).  The good news, after 70min of playing I'm on the second to last mission.  Yay?

To sum things up:

Pros:
-Cool weapons
-Fun moves
-Playing in a titan rules

Cons:
-NO single player
-Random ""Lost connection"" causes restart of missions
-Utter chaos (who do I shoot and who don't I shoot?!)
-No pause (seriously, sometimes you need to step out of the room, answer the phone, or pay attention to the dog.  But when it's online and ""real time"" you can't do it)

This could have been a really fun game.  The Titanfall setting and universe is amazing. Sadly, the tutorial was the best part.  Targeting multiple people with one trigger pull?  Count me in!  Oh, wait, it's multiplayer only, so these aren't AI, meaning people don't group together, so you'll almost never get to do this.  I can't believe they spent so much time with stunning graphics, awesome weapons and a cool setting and then left out the actual game.  I'd be all in if there was a campaign, but without it I don't see the fun in the game.  If you don't mind the multiplayer only, give it a shot.  If you're like me, steer clear.

PS: I'm not on the last level.  Total time since starting the game (including the long tutorial): 1hr 20 min.

PPS: In the time it took me to edit this review I have completed the campaign.  Sigh.",12-01-2014

With a more interesting universe than Destiny, Titanfall's lack of a solid campaign prevents you from being full immersed in its mythology.

It's highly accessible and WAY more fun than Call of Duty games for those of us who don't want to spend hours practicing the latest glitches and exploits or learning the maps for sniper points. Titanfall multiplayer is very forgiving, and I would encourage you to check it out if you have a distaste multiplayer games because of the general tenor of multiplayer gaming. You can just sit down and plan and have a great time without worrying about being not good enough or out of practice.

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,If I could...3.5 stars,"I have owned this game since it was first released.  I purchased a second copy so me and my daughter can play online this Christmas after she gets her new Xbox one.

The gameplay is great in this game.  The attention to quality in the gameplay is evident.  Graphics also look great.  Really, the only reason i remove a star is for the lack of customization, and the lack of a good story.  Sure, customization isn't important to everyone, not even me really.  I just feel that a next gen game such as this should have more of it, and not less than competitors like Call of Duty.  Why should I be able to have more customization in a last gen CoD game than in this exclusive, high profile, next gen release? Again, it isn't that important to me, so I really only took away a half star.  The other half star is for the lack of story.  I actually think this would warrant a full star removed, but since I can't do 3.5 stars, I'll round up, not down.  This game would have made for a fantastic campaign, and begs to have more of the story told, but the ""campaign"" is nothing more than multiplayer games with a little more story telling in between.  Not what I consider a fulfilling story.

In the end, the great gameplay and graphics trumped the lack of story and customization.  This allowed me to still consider the game more of a four star game than a three star one.  As mentioned before, 3.5 would have been about right for me.",11-19-2014

I first must start out by stating that I LOVE playing this game, and would recommend it to anyone now that it's cheap - its mechanics, gameplay, graphics, etc. are fantastic, its a blast to play with friends, particularly since its an exclusive.  However, there's always a small part of me that feels disappointed in what the game could have been.  I bought this new off a third party seller here for less than $20, which was a great deal.  However, if I would have paid the full $60 at launch for it, I would have felt VERY let down.

My issues, which are still very affected by the fact that the game is/was $60 at retail:

A big complaint - there is no REAL campaign.  They didn't try to hide it, but still.  It seems stupid sometimes, but many people & gamers (including me) would be so much more sucked in by some sort of story.  Campaigns in shooters can have very fun unique missions and provide some sort of context/connection behind the premise of the game. Hire a writer to create a clever, even somewhat cliche story for the campaign and spend some more time on the design, and it would have made the game much better, even if it wasn't at a high standard.

Multiplayer is what this game is, and it's fantastic, but even that has its shortcomings.  The amount of maps the game comes with, along with some minor customization gripes and missing features like private play, more modes, etc. are unacceptable.  You have to pay a little extra cash for more maps, and still hope for more promised DLC, which may or may not come.  It definitely borrows heavily from the mechanics/feel of Call of Duty, but not in a bad way.  More options would definitely improve the play.

Other than that, its still a fun game, and if you're among others like me who finally got convinced to buy an XBOX One at the end of this year because of the holiday pricing, Master Chief Collection, or whatever, I would highly recommend getting this game.  It will entertain you for many hours on end.

Like me, you will also likely find yourself thinking that it is a good, fun game, but that had the potential to be a classic.",11-15-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,Wow is this game underrated,"If you like shooters and you have an Xbox One you should be playing this game.  I'm shocked at the tepid reception this game has gotten.  Yes, there is no campaign and that is absolutely a strike against it.  Any lost sales due to the lack of a one player mode are totally justified and the sequel NEEDS this to succeed.

As for the game that we did receive, the multiplayer is amazing.  Given that multiplayer is what most FPS fans are most interested in anyways, I fail to see why so many haven't given it a chance or gave up on it.  I've seen many gamers on forums say that it got boring!  COD sells 10 million units every year, then this game comes along and basically gives the same old formula a shot of adrenaline, and it's only a mild success.  It's COD plus piloting huge robots plus double jumping anywhere on the map.  Plus instead of simply leveling up constantly you actually have to complete challenges to prestige (or regen in this case).  I just don't get it.  Are gamers this averse to change?

Like I said if you enjoy shooters and you purchased the new Xbox I have no doubt you'll get your money's worth here.  The community isn't as busy as COD's but there are still plenty of people and full lobbies.  This one deserves to have success.",09-30-2014

As a new player to FPS games getting headshot over and over by snipers was rather daunting. I've found the game has no remorse for lower level players and will pit them against the die hard veterans, so be prepared to leave and rejoin a few times to get a fair game (or get better).

It's pretty fun even though it plays like a Call of Duty game mixed with giant robots and Battlefield-esque environments (no destructive environments. Just map style.) Unfortunately the game doesn't have split-screen and it doesn't really have a campaign. The campaign sorta plays like the multiplayer except in the multiplayer, you can choose the gamemodes you'd like to play. I haven't really tried the campaign as much to give a good chunk of information about it.

I can highly recommend buying this game if you just got an Xbox One or need a game for it. I got mine for around $30 new, so hopefully you can get a good deal as well.

NOTE: At the time of this review, Titan fall is 40% off in the Xbox Live Store. Enjoy!",07-16-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,2,Titanfall stops short of being all that it could be.,"As many now have heard, the game has no campaign mode. While that is a problem for some, perhaps many, of the consumers who bought this game, my focus is on the multiplayer and the marks it hits, but also where it falls short. The campaign, for the sake of mention, is basically a very light coating of story, that is at times incomprehensible, that is added in the form of short cutscenes before a few missions and some dialog while the missions are ongoing. The campaign lasts about 9 missions, but now that few people play the game, its nearly impossible to complete any campaign missions.

The multiplayer is classic call of duty style FPS, it is fast paced and often frantic. Instead of ""kill streaks"" you get giant titans, which as some other reviews have mentioned, often go down with relative (and disappointing) ease. Long story short, titans are somewhat of a disappointment and you require a great degree above average skill to use them to great effect. Essentially, charging into battle with your titan is a waste of a titan, because it WILL go down sooner than you'd expect. You have to be smart about how you use titans or they're rendered utterly useless gimmicks. That said, getting in and out of the titans, when it works properly, is pretty cool and they can be used to great effect, just under limited circumstances and when using appropriate strategy.

The gameplay was smooth when the game was first released, I find it is a tad more sluggish now that a few months have passed and less people play, but it may be my imagination. Unless my eyes deceive me, I'm seeing everyone's latency bars at 3-4 bars instead of 5 bars, this has become the new norm. What it means is that most players are now experiencing some degree of lag while playing. There are only a few guns in the game and many of them are utterly useless. Like in many of the call of duties of years past, most players use the same 2-4 guns, but with the majority playing with the standard automatic assault rifle (for some reason, theres only one.) There are just enough types of guns, but not nearly enough going on here to keep you playing. Frankly, I only play this game because COD:Ghosts is downright awful and lets be real here, there are not many next-gen online FPS options available right now, you can count them on half of one hand. Further, how many online FPS games that are out are worth playing? Well, I would argue this game isn't a terrible place to settle, but it stands to reason that the game would have seen limited success if COD:Ghosts had been better, or if another FPS like Halo or Destiny had been released at the same time.

The game could have been great, but what you're getting, as many other reviewers have alluded, is merely an unfinished beta of a game that you paid full price for. The titans are cool, but there isn't much replay value here. My primary issue with the ""regen system"" which is this games version of call of duty's prestige system, is that it forces you to complete certain ""challenges"" before you may complete a regen. Each regen is different and has different challenges. What this was likely meant to do, is to encourage players to use different weapons and experience the game more fully, what it ends up doing however, is forcing the few players who play to use weapons that are down-right awful if they want to get any sense of progression from the game. Lastly, all I can do is express disappointment at the new trend for developers: releasing half-finished games to the general public at full price and expecting us to play and enjoy them. We are essentially paying for the anguish of discovering all the games positives and shortcomings. The latest update did make some positive changes to the matchmaking and the balancing of weapons, which was much needed, but many weapons are still down-right terrible, and I am often stuck on losing teams. Frankly, most games are decided not by the skill of the team, not by the success of the matchmaking, but by an excellent performance by one or two individual players. There are still many bugs in the game and lots to be fixed or improved upon, but if you like online FPS, you basically don't have too many choices, so you may as well try this game out. I'd like to close by saying that this game could have been great, and is great in some respects, but is lacking in many of the details.

Update:

I'm lowering the score of the game from 3/5 to 2/5 stars, although I considered lowering it to one star. Frankly, this game is an overpriced social experiment, like most of the terrible games released for next gen consoles. It is unacceptable for developers to release unfinished games with no features, a bunch of unpleasant drawbacks and force consumers to do things they just flat out dislike. The prestige system, as discussed above, is terrible. While the way they have it set up is genius from a development standpoint, thats irrelevant because this isn't a game for developers, its for consumers to enjoy. In other words, we did not pay money to be Guinea pigs for some unpleasant digital social experiment. And where that experiment leads to negative feedback as to some of the features, you remove them, period. The regeneration system makes a game I would otherwise enjoy much more, all the less enjoyable. The only reason they are getting away with this, is because there is literally no other FPS worth playing because COD and BF were flops this year (which is the subject of multiple lawsuits and I think is a great example of how unacceptable it is to release junk.) So if you purchase this game, you may enjoy the first one or two prestige, but I promise you, every single prestige after that will be unpleasant. Also, if you happen to be a good player, prepare to be teamed up with the worst players imaginable 80% of the time, which just adds to the frustration that the prestige system requires you to complete challenges that are either stupidly difficult, or just down-right annoying. The worst part about it, is that you can play this game quite a bit, but because of the design flaws, you get sick of it and end up hating it, only to maybe pick it up later, but only because there is literally no other FPS available. So as said in my earlier review, if you want to have some fun with big robots and don't care about prestige, your rank, your scores, or any of the things that most FPS players care about, this game may still be of some value to you. If you are a ""completionist,"" perfectionist, or competitive gamer, you will likely dislike this game as much or more than I do.

Playing this game is like living in a midevil land, ruled by a faceless tyrant, you are told what weapons to use, what to do with them, and how you will play. If you follow the prestige system, you are required to do the challenges, which usually amount to using really terrible weapons and doing a lot of really difficult stuff (if only because you have to do it with terrible weapons.) Am I complaining about challenges? Nope, I'm complaining about being forced to complete specific challenges that make the game less fun. These challenges are mandatory. If you want to progress YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE THEM! If that were all, it would be fine, but when you add that to the fact that you get matched with people who suck, in a game with terrible spawns and lots of stupid little bugs or design defects, you end up hating the game and rage quitting a lot. Selling video games is not unlike running a business, you want your customers to be happy, you want them to enjoy their experience, you do it for the customers. I feel like this is the love child of Respawn and its development team, but they didn't think at all about what sorts of people would enjoy playing or about the long-term success of the franchise. Long story short, unless the developers really put some effort into releasing a proper game next time, they will likely go bankrupt, because as the game is now, they cannot compete with other FPS. I expect no one will play once the new FPS come out in Fall of 2014.",07-14-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,"I don't like it, I LOVE IT!","I have been reading these reviews and am shocked at the reaction to this game.  It seems to be a very polarizing or just a misunderstood project.  To be clear, Titanfall IS the next great thing! It is revolutionary. It is the epitome of multiplayer. It is little new but full of things you already love and things you didn't know you love.
I don't want to rebut another's review, however, I feel compelled to reign in the rancor. The most popular review by 007, aka ""cmyth007,"" is a poor representation of this product. In the review, it is said the customer knew this was a multiplayer-only game, but the customer praised the multiplayer aspects of Titanfall and faulted it for having no co-op or single player campaign.  If you knew no co-op or singleplayer existed, why buy it to begin with if that's what you were looking for?  It is also claimed that no multiplayer-only game is worth $60 or a 5-star review. It begs the question, why buy a game you knew was a multiplayer-only game if it wouldn't be worth the $60 you paid?  An edit was added that then contrasted Titanfall to Gears of War 3.  Gears of War 3 is the best third-person-shooter on Xbox 360. It was a huge game that vastly improved on its predecessors. But, is that a fair comparison?  Wouldn't a more apt comparison be the original Gears of War? It was the first killer app for the Xbox 360 and had meager multiplayer offerings. The multiplayer on OG Gears was thrown-together and didn't acknowledge the Xbox Live platform: no party system, no matchmaking, and broken mechanics, i.e. invulnerable as you chainsawed enemies.  Gears 2 and 3 fixed these problems and expanded the game.  It would be safer to wait and compare Titanfall 3 to Gears 3.
To reiterate, Titanfall is an online-only multiplayer game. The campaign is multiplayer matches mixed with back-story. It has a few modes that are different twists on game types you are already familiar with if you've played any shooters recently. Attrition game mode is like team deathmatch, but NPC kills, Titan kills, and Pilot kills add to your teams total, each being worth a different number of points. Last Titan standing is a round-based mode where everyone begins the round in a Titan and must destroy the other team's Titans to win the round, whether you kill the pilots or not. Pilot Hunter is like Attrition, but only pilot kills add to your team's total points. Capture the flag is just that; get flag, return it to ""base."" Hardpoint is very similar to Domination in CoD or Territories in Halo. Three capture points are fought over in order to reach the time goal first.  They recently added temporary game types starting with Marked for Death. This is my new favorite mode. One player on each team is Marked as the target; the goal? Kill the other team's marked man before your team's gets whacked. If you do, you get a point and new targets are selected. Get 10 points first, to win.
Titanfall includes things you have seen elsewhere, but few games have so many in the same game.  As you play and rank up you unlock challenges to complete that net you more XP and Burn Cards (We'll get to those).  As you focus on unlocking the challenges, you will rank up faster and unlock more gear for your Titan and pilot.  You have seen similar set-ups in games like Call of Duty.  But, Titanfall does something different from Call of Duty.  When you prestige, or regenerate as it is called in Titanfall, you will be given a specific list of challenges to complete before you can regenerate again.  It's a  nice change.  Not only do you need to put in time to rank up, you'll need to be SKILLED and unlock some very difficult challenges.  The other change from the norm are the Burn Cards.  These are brilliant little perks for unlocking challenges that give you one-time-use advantages in game.  They can give you extended abilities, stronger weapons, free Titans, extra xp and faster titan build times.  They burn up after one life or game with them.  Only 3 can be taken in to each game, but since this last update, you can hold around a hundred at once if you are Generation 10.  For folks who have said that Titanfall got old too fast, you're doing it wrong!
In Titanfall, there is so much happening at once on screen you will have a difficult time taking it all in at first.  I think a lot of these negative reviews stem from that and misunderstanding the lack of singleplayer.  You have drop ships flying over head dropping off more grunts, drop pods falling to the ground with more spectres, titans roaming and dropping in constantly, and pilots ziplining, wallrunning, double-jumping, shooting, etc.  No call of duty or Gears has this kind of scope.  Even with AC-130 gunships flying overhead, Titanfall has more action than any of those.  I went back to play CoD Ghosts and felt like my character was stuck in mud the whole game.  I used to think CoD was twitchy, nope, not anymore.
Respawn Entertainment just updated the Xbox One and PC versions of Titanfall.  Now, they've added new customizations of titans and new burn cards and challenges.  They updated the lobbies and menu screens.  The game looks even better now!  And, I have more to unlock.  I have been taking my time with regenerating and love just playing to play.  I am currently on Generation 9, working on my challenges for 10.  I have loved my Xbox One and this game.  Xbox Record That! is my new catchphrase.
Note: I have both the Xbox One version (downloaded from MS) and the 360 version (from Amazon).  The Xbox one is the way to go.",07-03-2014

Back in the day, my friends and I would spend countless sleepless nights grinding away in matchmaking.  No game has really come close to the fun times had in Halo 2 and 3.  Titanfall at least makes a valiant effort toward this end.  In terms of in-your-face, instant fun, Titanfall does the job.

Here are the factors that played a role in my rating:

+ Small learning curve despite innovative gameplay.  The game does a nice job of getting you up to speed.

+ Innovative FPS experience.  The wall running, pilot/titan dichotomy, and end-of-match escapes provide a relief from the mainstream call of duty experience we deal with every year.

+ Great balance between pilot and titan gameplay.  You don't feel at a disadvantage as a pilot.  You don't feel like you're ganged up on as a titan.  The balance is perfect.

- No single player is a downside for a game of this caliber.  I would have liked to have seen some beautiful cinematics and meaningful storytelling to show off the Xbox One's capabilities.

- The leveling/ranking system is similar to the ""prestige"" system made popular by Call of Duty and pervasive in today's online shooters.  I would have liked to have seen a return to the systems that reward skill more than time spent playing (circa Halo 3).",06-10-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,3,"Very fun and fast-paced, but load times are horrible!","I took off one star because there is no single player campaign. Every FPS should have a single player campaign, especially considering the size of this game. It doesn't have to be as great as the CoD campaigns, but I'd be fine with BF4-ish. Otherwise, the story is kinda dull in the multi-player campaign mode.

While the graphics are very nice and the gameplay is great (I especially love wall running and jumping from building to building), the load times are horrible. I do not know if it is the match making or what.

For example, I will select a campaign mission that I enjoy, and it may take 2 minutes to find a team, then it takes another 2 minutes to find an opposing team, and then when you finally get that match, you have to wait 90 seconds for the level to load! These times are unacceptable.

I must say the overall concept of being a pilot manning, a well equipped Titan, during a War is a great concept! However, with these irregular circumstances there should have been an EPIC STORY LINE. But there was no story, well at least one worth following. There should have been CHARACTERS, VOICES and PERSONALITIES! Instead there was nothing at all but random voices that would chime in for not apparent reason.

MULTIPLAYER
One word LACKLUSTING!!! All of the maps are Giant patterns that are of no significance, If we had a story line I feel that the players would be more interested and connected with the maps. Also I bought the $27 Seasonal pass. It was WORTHLESS because no DLC was released. The only thing that was released was more MUNDANE maps that were identical to the older ones.
And also I want to know WHY CANT I COLOR OR CUSTOMIZE MY TITAN'S SKIN???
Because everyone's Titan looks a like the game's graphics are a waste.

OVERALL REVIEW
I really hope that they get this right whenever they release a second game. As someone who was a potential fan of Titan fall I must say I am disappointed. I made it up to level 46 and just have no interest in picking the game back up. I troll the internet looking for DLC every day but I am left hanging after spending $27 on a season pass.

With many traditional game styles you will have a lot to do.

Upgrades are challenge based, helping to make you a better player.

Overall the game styles are great, but lack any variability.  What I mean by that is you generally will start in the same place and have the same goals on the same maps.  Hardpoint locations do not vary, as well as Flag locations.  This can make the game very predictable.",05-21-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,1,Multiplayer Only!!,"If you want this game strictly for its Multiplayer capabilities, than it is a decent game. The overall mechanics are those of a normal FPS but with cool additional features such as wall running, Titans and a couple others. What totally killed this game for me was the lack of a Campaign mode. Before others tell you there is a Campaign mode and this is false, let me explain. So ""technically"" the game offers what they think is a Campaign mode but really just another Multiplayer mode.

A typical Campaign mode to me is:
*One player mode with the option of co-op sometimes
*Great story line with engaging cut-scenes
*The ability to pause and pick up where you left off
*Somewhat linear story in that you have to complete Mission 1 to proceed to Mission 2 and so on

A typical Multiplayer mode to me is:
*Usually online focused
*Multiple players are required
*You can choose any map or mode you like
*No story line

Here is TitanFall's Campaign mode:
*Online focused
*Multiple players required (No user level moderation so you will play your first time at level 1 against a level 42 user)
*No story line or engaging cut-scenes
*No ability to pause and pick up where you left off
*100% linear story in that you have to complete Mission 1 to proceed to Mission 2 and so on

As you can see, there is absolutely nothing that makes the so-called Campaign mode anything different than a Multiplayer mode. It is Multiplayer 1 and 2 mode. The only thing different I can recall is that instead of starting on the ground on the level and your goal being displayed on your screen (something like ""Kill all your enemies to complete this mission) you are in a helicopter and a voice tells you ""You must kill all the enemies to complete this mission"". They then drop you on the ground! I completed three missions and still have no clue what the premise of the story is besides kill the other team before they kill you.

Putting it bluntly, EA and Respawn are absolute idiots if they think this game offers a Campaign mode. Lol, it was probably the producers of NBA Live who worked on this game. If you want a $40 Multiplayer game that is decent at best, you are in luck. Otherwise, save your money and time for another game.",05-17-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,"Great game, just needs.....","Titanfall is a FPS (first person shooter) game that is set in a future time. You play as a pilot, which starts off running & gunning (and jumping, scaling buildings & running on them) on foot. Then, a few minutes later you are told your Titan is ready to be deployed! At which point you can deploy it, or save it for your next respawn (should you end up dying). If you save it for when you respawn, you'll drop from the sky inside it. Or if you deploy it. It drops from the sky. And you can get in it, or have it on a auto control and fight on it's own while you run around on foot and attack! Various types of these mechs are available. As well as various weapons and abilities. You will continue to rank/level up. And it unlocks a lot of cool weapons,skills,ect...Also there are burn cards. Burn cards are like percs or bonus items you collect. You can hold many. And you can pick 3 burn cards to use in a match. If you maybe wanna use one to make your Titan like a bomb. So when others attack it and it is about to be destroyed. It will blow up s much that it's blast has a radius that it will damage anything in it! This game is pretty fast paced! Much like Call Of Duty, you battle it out on various maps. And with people online. This game is great, and with this level of creativity, it will only get better! Titanfall is great. But, it does have one area of the game that needs to be present. And that's a offline stoy mode. You can only play this game online. So if for any reason your net service is having a issue.

We purchased a Wii 5-6 yrs ago but games like CoD and Battlefield have always been banned from our home.

Titanfall while still violent isn't like the other FPS games.  The game-play doesn't revolve around maximizing violence.  Don't misunderstand, as a player, you're still shooting people but you're not inundated with blood and gore at every turn like CoD. A decent number of your enemies are huge mechanical titans and human sized ""drone"" robots / soldiers. The only gore is when a Titan squishes or punches an unarmored human or shoots a human with a ridiculously large lightning gun.

With all that said, I have to admit it's addictive and ridiculously fun. The titan element is awesome.  I got this game for my 11yr old and he has handled it quite maturely. I don't know that I'd go much younger than that simply b/c some of the idiots that play, curse like sailors.  We ALWAYS mute other active players but this is a problem with online play in general. I cringe when I hear parents tell me they let their 5-8yr olds play CoD. The things those kids hear and see... wow.

My only nit is that it's a single player game.  You can't play w/ 2 people (on the same machine) in split screen mode. I didn't realize that fact when I bought it. I was hoping to use it as father/son bonding time.  Oh well, we'll have to train for the coming zombie apocalypse some other way...

The graphics are excellent, the gameplay and control is very fluid, and the concept is just awesome.  However, Titanfall fell short for me in some VERY big ways.  The lack of a story or campaign mode was very disappointing, but I gave it a shot anyway after reading all the good reviews and hearing friends tell me how great it was.  The only two options available to play are the online ""story"" and the multiplayer games.  The story is very thin, hard to follow, and practically nonexistent.  It's just a shortly narrated excuse for shooting at things.  While the gameplay itself is glorious fun, it feels exactly like what you would expect an online-only multiplayer game would.  Run, shoot, die, respawn, rinse, repeat.  Matching seems to be an issue as well.  I was immediately thrown into matches with players MUCH MUCH more experienced than myself, which lead to me dying very quickly and a lot more than I expected.  This takes much of the fun out of the game.  If you are a fan of online multi-player games, (I admittedly, am not) Titanfall is a solid game.  It's only real drawback in the multiplayer arena is the lack of options for the matches.  However, I expected so much more in a game with such a collection of awards and accolades.

I'm not going to take that away from Respawn. It is an excellent effort and I have already spent tons of hours playing it. I also did hear that Respawn was on a limited schedule, so they couldn't do everything that had planned out. And most impressively, I did see that they will be making add-ons for free that they thought should have been included in the game. Like the private matches and more game modes (still to come though).

To continue to play Titanfall I would need to see updates for players having more classes of pilots, more titans, a co-op mode and more interaction on maps. I was not destroyed by the lack of a campaign because personally in the past I spent about 10% playing campaign and 90% online play. Though, I would like to see these updates on the more titans, pilot classes, and co-op mode because without those I can't really justify playing Titanfall much longer, or buying Titanfall 2 for $60 in the future.

From the wall running to the ""Prepare for Titanfall"" this game has kept me more than occupied. The multiplayer player maps are fantastically designed and fun to play on.  Overall this fast paced, action packed is one of, if not the best FPS I have played in quite sometime.",04-23-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,Titanfall Lives Up to the Hype,"I was very excited to try out Titanfall when the gameplay video was released from last year's E3.  When it was finally released last month, it didn't disappoint.  I've been playing just about every major FPS game ever released from Quake III, Unreal Tournament, Halo, Call of Duty, Killzone, Battlefield, etc.  Titanfall reminds me of a mix between Unreal Tournament and Mech Assault/Warrior.  The double jump was something I remember from Unreal.  The wall running adds a whole new dimension that challenges you to get vertical for a good vantage point or get killed from above.

Once you are in a mech, it's like a completely different game.  You have to keep your mech on the move or risk getting boarded via rodeo.  There are a couple ways to deal with cowboys, give them an electric cloud or jump out and shoot them.  One recent method I discovered was ejecting then detonating a satchel charge to blast cowboys off your mech, usually killing them.  As with Mech Assault, if you stand toe-to-toe with another mech, eventually one of the mechs will get destroyed.  The survivor usually only has a sliver of health left, easy pickings for a second enemy mech or pilot.  But the countermeasures/defense help add depth to a mech matchup.

Throw up a shield and fire off an ordinance of cluster missiles at the right time and location, and you can damage two or three different mechs while targeting pilots all from a protected position.  I am really looking forward to the expansions that will allow you to add your own custom decals, additional weapons and possibly a new mech class.  In the mean time, there's no other game that gives me more of a rush than Titanfall.

Personally, I'm glad that Respawn spent more time perfecting the multiplayer than getting tied up by a tacked on single player mode.  They can always create a kick ass campaign mode for the sequel with cinematics and everything.  That will all be made possible by the success of the first game.",04-22-2014

The beta didn't have all aspects of the game, and I get that.  I just didn't feel $60 was a fair price for what you were getting.  The game went on a one day sale down to $36.99 and I was all over it at that price.  I was saying at launch ""make it a $39.99 game and more people will be willing to buy.""  there are games with full campaigns and different multiplayer options for the same $60 price tag.  Why would Titanfall, a game with only online and an ok story thrown in be the same price?  whoever decision it was to drop the price below $40 even for a day is a genius.  I'd be willing to bet more people would venture to the game if the price were to stay.  All in all great game for what I paid.",04-22-2014

You call it in and she drops down like a gift from the Gods.. if you feel like staying outside for a little enemy titan rodeo, go ahead and throw your titan into auto mode.. nothing like having an ogre titan watching your back while you continue sprayin newbs. The options are great and leave you wanting more and more unlocks. Not sure why people are saying it doesnt have a campaign, it has a campaign its just an online one. Fighting for both sides will give you around 4-5 hours of campaign time. Dont believe the nay sayers when they claim its just Call of Duty with mechs.. its much more.

The graphics are outstanding, the controls are great, but the story is lacking....in a big way!  The fact you have to be online to play the game, never really understanding the story, gives this game a huge disadvantage.  The game is though very fun, but with the ridiculously big holes in the game and limited game modes, it is a serious detractor.  The game is good, but nothing exceptional, and definitely not worthy of 1 star, but definitely not a 5 star game either.

Ive been very tempted to sell my xbox one, but have been holding on to it to see if they change there ways, and make them like they should! Today it seems they want you to buy a half game, and they spend another 100.00 on extra content that should have been in the game to begin with. Also, no single player is also a let down! No bots, no co-op, no-offline play! Hope they change back, because otherwise I bought a system for NO reason!

The things you can do in this game make you feel awesome. Just the fact of running on walls and soaring the sky and dashing with the stryder Is already a 4 star Rating. I truly feel many of the lower reviews put bad ratings because there is no campaign or they just ran into good players. I'm not here to brag, but i can literally go 50-0 4 out of 5 games, even against good players.

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,3,"Lot of hype, little substance","Was really excited for Titanfall to release. Especially with all the hype surrounding it. (Yeah, I fell for it, hook line and sinker). The fact there's no true campaign or co-op modes doesn't bother me. I knew this going in. I buy shooters for the online play anyway, so no biggie. My disappointment came from the lack of content. To be so hyped, this game has very few weapons to choose from, the customization is sparse at best. Game modes...............ugh. Cap the Flag, Hardpoint Domination, and three versions of Team Death Match. You gotta be kidding me. I'll give it this much, it's visually pleasing and the gameplay in and of itself is smooth. Have experienced no usual online shooter issues (lag, poor hit detection, losing server connection, etc), so hats off to Respawn for that. Only problem, with all the good, the lack of substance really makes this game fun in short spurts. I still play it every now and again, but it's not my ""go to"" shooter I was hoping for. The other shooters on the One have much more depth and offer a much more immersive experience. Overall, it just falls short of its billing. If you're contemplating buying this game, and it is fun, but I'd very much advise to wait for a price drop. Just not worth the price tag.

NOTE: Though I knew going in there was no story mode, I feel like Respawn missed a great opportunity at a fantastic story with the new world they've created. Could've been something great.",04-11-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,1,Disappointed!,"Was looking forward to a new game and this one reminded me of the MechWarrior game (which I had liked so much) of the past. I thought I'd take a chance on it till I read it is ONLY multiplayer and ONLY on-line!??? Two killers for me, so I will not be buying this one. It seem to me it is just a come on to sell their ""Gold Live"" on-line account which is another $60 per year just to play the game. Add that on to the $60 or so of the games cost (if you buy it straight out of the chute) and we are looking at a very expensive video game, not to mention that Xbox One purchases (yes, Xbox 360 version is out now) ...what is up with that?
I am in a rural area and depend on Sat. Internet for my connection. I have had bad vibes from other player when attempting to play ""on-Line"" do to the slow speed affecting their play. Then there is the ""bandwidth"" restriction to deal with? The very reason I don't play Multiplayer On-line with Halo. But, I have enjoyed playing all the Halo (1,2,3,4 ) game at my own speed and level through all the Campaigns.

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,3,Awesome game. Just needs more,"This is probably one of the best designed and balanced games that have come out in a long time. It plays so smoothly and there is hardly any lag at all online. I have played this game close to a month now and I still enjoy it. My problem is it has been a month and we still only have 5 game modes, limited weapons/upgrades and many other features that should have come with a multiplayer only game. This game is already losing its luster. You cant keep people engaged for long periods of time with what is offered here. To me this is a solid base of a game.

Pros:
1. High quality and quantiy of maps
2. Great game balance between pilot and Titan. Either one could be their own multiplayer game. Together they are fantastic
3. Good solid weapons and upgrades that are very well balanced. There are some favorites.
4. Very fluid gameplay. Everything works
5. The offered gametypes work very well. (Attrition is my personal least favorite)
6. Solid sound effects and graphic effects. You really feel the difference between being on foot and in a Titan. The guns all feel powerful.
7. This game does not feel as frustrating when you are having an off night.

Again all of this makes for a great experience but this game needs some updates. If you were to compare the multiplayer only features of some of the top games last generation to Titanfall it would not be able to stand next to them. Titanfall does not have a rich feature set at this point. If it changes I will update my score. Being a multiplayer only game it should be feature rich or at least have had stuff added already.

Some Cons
1. Match making is not of Halo quality. Most of the time I am destroying the other team or we are getting destroyed. The high intensity close matches do not happen a lot. (they look like they are working on this)
2. Leveling up feels like a grind. Why should I do it
3. 5 game modes. ummm yea
4. No customization. Outside of a few loadouts.
5. No clans, no hoard mode (i know not really applicable), no private matches, I could go on

PvZ has been updated already and they sold way less then you. I will stop there cause you get the point. Like I said once or if this game gets up to par I will update my score. I still would recommend this game. They did some wonderful work in creating a nice base of a game. We just need the gravy now and it will be great.",04-07-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,Insanely addictive game!,"Titanfall really isn't anything new.  The concepts within it are pieced together from many other games, and at times it feels like an amalgamation of Call of Duty, Tribes, and Mechwarrior all combined into a single game.

However, those pieces - fast, parkour style running, and the added element of mech battles - are assembled in an incredibly clean, well polished manner that is so different from your typical multiplayer shooter these days (ahem, I'm talking to YOU Battlefield 4!).  For players that are either new to FPS, or new to playing them on a console with a gamepad (as I was), you are not forced to solely be at the whim of other players who will pummel you mercilessly for possibly weeks, as I found in COD: Ghosts, where the gamepad learning curve is steep and sometimes depressing.  Instead, Titanfall also adds in Grunts and Specters.  These are AI controlled combatants who are relatively easy kills, even for the newly initiated.  This gives an overall sense of accomplishment to the noob, even if that person isn't making a whole lot of headway against actual players.  That makes things a whole lot more fun, and makes you less prone to simply throwing down your controller in disgust.  At the same time, between actual players there is still enough of a challenge to keep even the most skilled engaged for a long time.

Overall, the game could use some more game modes, and some more weapons, but the fluidity of gameplay - even without a true campaign mode - has this as one of the most fun games I have sat down with in a long time.",04-04-2014

Most games like this have a campaign plus multiplayer this game is pretty much 100% multiplayer.  If you like COD multiplayer this is for you but if you are expecting a game also like Halo etc you will not be getting that.  The campaign is just multilplayer stages that is just not enough for a game like this.  Now the idea that I can run around and shoot PLUS drive a machine is a cool concept but is only step 1.

The menu's are easy to navigate and joining a game is easy and takes little navigation or effort.  Titanfall is smooth and you'll feel right at home after 2-3 rounds.  I'm a big COD fan, but I also play the Battlefield series along with Killzone and Halo.  I think this gives you the best of most other shooters that are out.  It has the speed and ease of use of a COD title, the weapons look and feel similar to a Killzone title, and the Titans bring the shield and armor system that a Halo game has.  My problem with Halo games are I don't like the shield and armor on a soldier.  It works great on a Titan though, where you are still a fragile human driving this monster.

I've played Titanfall for around 10 hours or so since it was released and I have to say that I find myself looking forward to playing it more than COD: Ghost's, Battlefield 4, or Killzone.

I decided to give Titanfall a chance when I was invited to the beta. I was instantly hooked. I am still not very good at the game, but for some reason I absolutely love this game. I am slowly becoming better and every time I play it I find I still enjoy it and don't get bored. While I still die a lot in the game I am finding I am having fun while doing it.

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,Very enjoyable effort from Respawn,"I'll keep my review simple:
- If you're looking for an extended single player game, this isn't the game for you.  That being said, the campaign that is part of the game is a lot of fun.  You play though it twice - once as each faction in the game.  Yes it is short, but still fun. You play version of the multiplayer as part of the campaign.
- The multiplayer is a blast!  You don't have a to be good at FPS to have fun with this game.  Each team is filled in with AI soldiers, therefore even a novice player can still rack up some kills.
- As with any FPS each player will find the weapons they prefer.  The weapons that are available are fairly easy to get used to and you can upgrade them as you progress through the campaign and multiplayer.
- As a pilot you have to get good at wall running and double jumping.  Becoming proficient at those skills will make survival a little easier.
- The Titans - I'm still not very good in my Titans, but man are they a blast to pilot.  It's a good thing the training isn't optional, because piloting a Titan would have been difficult.
A couple of general things I have experienced:
- The games move quickly - not a lot of down time during the round
- Very few players camping!  I'm sure there are some that do, but I haven't experienced hardly any in the matches I've played.
- Time between rounds can be way too long.  Now this is kind of a double edged sword.  It gives you time to change your classes if you want without having to rush.  On the other hand, if players keeps coming in and out of the room, the timer can sometimes keep resetting.  Not a big deal, but a little annoying.",03-27-2014

I was excited to have this game for almost a year. When it arrived, everything was awesome!!! For about a day. I beat the whole game in 3 hours... then I played through again, then I got bored with it. Also, I was interested to find out the hard way that campaign mode isn't really campaign mode. It's ALL multiplayer. You can hang out in the beginning part of the match when it first starts to see this so called storyline, but meanwhile the 'real players' on the other team will just dominate your team.

Here's my pro's and con's.....

Pro's-
Amazing graphics
Smooth gameplay
Wide variety of weapons, classes and titans retains small amount of replay value
Acrobatics add a nice touch (double jump, wall run, etc.)

Cons-
No communication. Nobody talks ( I mean NOBODY)
Felt like game was over before it started.
Sniper rifles are unrealistically inaccurate.
They have a smart pistol that locks on headshots? (Hello? Multiplayer?)
Somehow players have managed to sniff out all exploits in the game and now after just a week or two it's just like call of duty,
gank central
Way too many players brand new to FPS's being forced to play online (nice shooting gallery but sucks when they're on your team.)
They hand out way too many achievements, ( I think I got one for dying once, WTF?)
Every single friend of mine that has this game is now bored of it and hates it ( about 30 friends or so)

The graphics are just OK which I can get past and the multiplayer is fast paced and intense BUTTTTTT the whole sense of achievement you get feels hollow.

The games are non -stop action, but it's not non-stop action against other, skilled players. It's most playing against bots and/or auto-titans. At the end of the match when you check your stats you MAYBE killed 9 real people and that's a good match. The experience is very cheap, not in the call of duty everybody is camping way, but in its own sense. You kill or get killed because the bots are distracting you or maybe a mech spots you from across the way.

I applaud them for trying something different but after the hype dies down this is just another shooter and the experience feels water downed and less competitive.",03-26-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,2,"Great potential, but doesn't follow through.","I really wanted to like this game. I played enough to get to level 20 before passing judgement.
What's good:
The gameplay as a pilot is really nice, and as you advance, you gain ordinance and weapons to make it more enjoyable. I would say that it slightly edges out other FPS because of the parkour movements you can perform. The wall running and double/mid-air jumps you can perform are pretty cool. If it weren't for that, it would fall behind other FPS because of the lack of customization and available weapons. Playing as a titan is so-so. You're big, you have armor, shields, and big guns, but by itself is nothing new. What makes the gameplay original is the ability to switch between pilot and titan or set the titan to automatically assist you in battle. This is really a unique and fun experience that I haven't seen in any other game. It not only allows you to choose how you will do battle, but who you will do battle with - you can choose to target other pilots or go after titans (whether your a pilot or titan).
What I didn't like:
1. No single-player campaign. I know that creating campaigns takes a lot of time and money - but that's what other games do and charge the same price. You are only getting a portion of what other games offer - the smaller and cheaper portion - for the same price. They developed a good FPS platform, but just didn't bother putting it in a game - just little matches that are usually the side content of a game. Only having online multiplayer also forces you to always pay for the online subscription in addition to the cost of the game.
2. The multiplayer modes they have really don't offer much variety. They all end up playing very similar - kill everyone on the opposing side.
3. No matching of players. When you first start you will be playing AS a level 1, but your opponents are not matched to you so they can be level 20, 30, 40, etc. This makes a big difference because they will have access to better weapons, scopes, abilities through game cards, etc. You can also get very lopsided teams - a lot of high level players on one team and low levels on the other.
4. How the matches are playing out. The matches now all seem the same - run around and kill as many enemies as you can. About 85% of kills comes from player A shooting player B in the back, while player B is trying to shoot player C in the back, while player C ... you get the idea. 5% come from campers/sniper kills. 5% from face-to-face combat. 5% from titans killing pilots or titans. More and more the matches seem to be devolving into everyone jumping into a titan for as much of the game as possible - its getting to be a new form of camping. Also, the free-for-all nature really takes away from the great parkour movements. You never really get to use these other than to scurry into or out of a combat area.

At this point, I choose this game only when I don't have a lot of time to play. I can get in and play 3-4 matches and get out in under an hour. 3-4 matches is about all I can take anyway as I get annoyed by the lack of variety, zero progression without a campaign, and how the matches always play out.

If you like online multiplayer FPS and quick free-for-all matches of ""kill as many as you can"", then this is the overpriced game for you. If you want many hours of gameplay to hold your interest, then I don't recommend it.",03-23-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,Best Shooter Multiplayer in a while,"This game has the best integration of movement into general gameplay of any shooter I've ever played. Anyone who says Titanfall is ""dumbed down CoD"" is either playing a different game or not using the capabilities of this game correctly.

The wall-running, double-jumping and ziplines create ways of moving around the map that simply don't exist in any other current shooter. It also creates a new skill set that you can use to get the advantage over other players. If you're able to use the environment to your advantage better, you can escape situations that others can't and also get the drop on other players.

Kills are quick, but not overly so (not near the idiotic speed that you saw in some of the recent Infinity Ward CoD titles). Graphics are excellent, although there can be some lag every now and then when gameplay gets intense.

The total number of guns is less than I might have expected, but each one has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, unlike some situations in games like BF3 where yes, technically there were TONS of different sniper rifles, but many were more or less interchangeable. In Titanfall, each gun has its own role, and no other weapon really replicates that role. That said, I hope they do add more weapons, particularly sidearms, in updates.

To address concerns of getting bored quickly: EXPLORE THE MAPS and try out new options. The size and complexity of many of the maps lends them to many different styles of gameplay and strategies, and strategy completely changes based on game mode as well.

As to the balance of AIs vs human players: some other reviewers have addressed concerns that they can't find other human players and spend all their time killing AIs. This is what happens if you're not mobile. As long as you're active in the game and not just sitting in one spot (which could definitely be a winning strategy in deathmatch style games from titles like MW2...Rundown, anyone?) you shouldn't have a problem finding plenty of action.

Overall Pros:
- EXTREMELY fast-paced, frenetic gameplay
- EXTREMELY good movement capabilities and integration into gameplay
- Good definition of weapon roles
- Excellent maps
- Good graphics
- Good customization options for loadouts (both as a human and for your Titans)
- GAMEPLAY REWARDS QUICK THINKING AND CREATIVE MOVEMENT

Overall Cons:
- Some more weapons, particularly sidearms, would be nice
- Occasional Xbox lag
- Melee attacks are still one-hit kill from the front (personal preference: I think CS, BF and Halo did it right)

My advice? If you like shooters for their multiplayer, buy it!

P.S - A lot of people are complaining that there's no (real) campaign. Get over it. We all knew that going in, and campaign is not where the vast majority of replay value is for games like these. That said, I think they COULD make an excellent campaign if they choose to do so with Titanfall 2.",03-22-2014

The issues so far:

1. Took FOREVER to download and unlike the Xbox 360, the Xbox One timed out while downloading it more than once.  12 hours later and having to turn the Xbox One back on a couple times I was at 97%.  This is what Microsoft thought was the future of gaming?  Yikes!

2. Connectivity issues - on a multiplayer only game this game is worthless when xbox can't connect. But don't worry, once they got that solved, we've had regular server issues within Titanfall where it can't find a matchmaking server.

3. Screen tearing.  The graphics look OK but certainly not good enough to be called ""next-gen."" I expect the 360 to look about the same.

4. Severe lag on occasion, especially when there is a lot going on in the game.

5. 1st update happened last night which ruined the Hardpoint game mode by reducing hold points, thus turning the game into TDM for people who are bad at TDM.  Since you no longer get significant points for holding a point, people now camp near the hardpoint and pick people off as they go for it.  They get to then ""recapture"" the hardpoint for more points.

6. No singleplayer.  I knew this going in and actually prefer multiplayer but when the servers are down, which has been a lot lately, the game is just taking hard drive space.

7. Too easy to level up. After being out for one week, lobbies are full of people being Generation 4, 5, and 6.  One guy completed all 10 generations and maxed out at level 50 in just a few days.

8. No real matchmaking.  WAY too often I jump into a lobby where the opposing team is all Gen 4 or greater and the team I get put on are very low level and haven't regenerated at all.  You know how much XP you get when your team gets slaughtered?  Very little so leveling up takes MUCH longer.  If they shuffled up teams like COD does, matches wouldn't be lopsided and both teams have a fair chance at winning.

All that being said, the studio is active with the community and appear to be making changes based on feedback so I have high hopes this game will continue to get better.  I don't regret the purchase and look forward to the upgrades and changes to come.",03-22-2014

Boring game that was fun for a couple of days,"It was ok for a couple days, but then all my friends stopped playing it and said it was boring. I kept playing a few more days and finally saw what they meant. It's the same thing every match, just kill bots. Not enough people, you can't destroy anything at all. Can't even blow a hole in a wall, just shows a black mark. the few game modes it does have are all the same, there's no teamwork. The only fun part ended up being a novelty, Jumping up a wall. Games have done that forever, the game can't even run properly, it freezes up and starts stuttering and the framerate dips down to probably 3-4 frames per second for no reason at all. This happens not even in intense combat, just randomly.

Avoid the purchase, unless you're like me and don't care what others think or say. I had to find out for myself, and it cost me $20 that I lost when selling it used on ebay. It's just not a good game at all unless you're renting it for a weekend.",03-22-2014

No doubt about it.,"First of all, if you never played any first person shooter then you don't like much shooter. But for the people who enjoy first person shooter for example when BF4 works well its very fun to play.
Titanfall is a solid game that brings very new features to table. Its the combination of titans and pilots in the game that makes it nice.
Hardpoint is my favorite mode and its like domination and you have to hold the flags. Hold 2 flags and you will win.
Titanfall does have short amount of weapons for pilots. Needs more guns. But if you think like this if a game have 5 assault rifles people will always use the most powerful one and call the gun overpowered. So having less guns is good in this matter.
Titanfall comes with 15 maps as oppose to 10 maps for $60 in other multiplayer games.
If you buy Titanfall and you enjoy first person shooter you will enjoy it for hours, hundreds of hours.
I myself have 45 hours already and it feels like I haven't played it much. So I will be rocking hundreds of hours in this game.

I have three games for the one.  They were all right.  I actually only like one of them.  So, I got Titanfall.  That and the special controller.  Best Buy had it just sitting there.  One left.  Here are my thoughts.
Titanfall is the best looking One game I have.  The first one that looks crisp and clean.  The controls work great on the game.  I never have a problem moving around or doing whatever it is that I need to do.

Now for the problems.  Haha

Ok, firstly, can you say chaos?  The game starts, I move around, kill the enemy, move around, level complete.  What the hell?  That is what I thought the first day I played.  As soon as I start getting into the game, its over.  I understand there are things that must be done, but Ive not a clue what they are.  The game seems to just sits you in a location and gives you a task.  They do not do a very good job of letting you know why your doing it or, as I said, even what your doing.  I almost feel like I am watching a video of other people playing.  It just never feels like a game.  Perhaps its just me.

I guess that is all I will say about the game.  While it looks good, and may be fun, I never actually get the chance to get into it.  I wish I would have rented it first.

Oh, one final thing.  Seems like Ive played the main part for like a half hour.  When I went to play today, it looks like I am half done the levels.  I am to assume one of, if not both of these things.  You can go back and replay the levels.  Be cool to build up your stats.  For what purpose Im not sure.  Two, there will be more once you get through the levels that they show.",03-20-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,"Great multiplayer matches, no real campaign","I bought it with full knowledge of the nonexistent campaign. They have a campaign mode but it is just player matches with dialogue and you advance regardless if you win or lose. I think it is more like a tutorial than campaign. It is very short as well. I have not play single player campaigns since the first Modern Warfare came out. Multiplayer is my preference as is most of my friends. We just want to jump in, blow $#^@ up for 30 mins or so and then we have things to do. Sucks being an adult and have responsibilities.

Multiplayer is smooth, fast, frantic, action packed and loads of fun. If you like shooters, you'll love this. The integration of parkour system and mechs is amazing. This game gives you abilities that is loved in many games combined. On top of that, it does it very well.

What's bad besides no campaign? The AI is really dumb and slow. However on a counterpoint, the AI is not meant to great affect your multiplayer experience. The AI is used as dummy to boost your speed of getting a Titanfall. It is meant as an extra element of strategy to the game. If the AI was good, I would have a lot of trouble getting across the map because there's a lot of them and they deploy in squads.

There's really not much complaints from me besides it needs more content. There's really only 3 Titan chassis and a handful of weapons. There's not much upgrades for them either. On the pilot side, there's more choices but limited upgrades as well. I think for a Sci Fi shooter, the weapons needs more wow factors and differentiation. I really just want more of them because it is basically multiplayer only.",03-20-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,3,Zero Storyline,"I have to say that, with all of the hype that surrounded Titanfall, I had very high expectations for this title.  I'm a big fan of shooters, particularly sci-fi based shooters, so I was pretty excited to get my hands on this game.  I pre-ordered it weeks in advance without really doing any research on it, so shame on me.  I guess I assumed that since reports had dubbed Titanfall the ""XBOX One Savior"" due to slumping sales and the PS4's market dominance, that it would be a sure hit.  After a few hours of the game, I can safely say I'm pretty disappointed.

First, let me say that this isn't a bad game at all.  Visually, it looks great.  Characters and environments are well done.  The sound, controls and overall gameplay are also first rate.  In all honesty, I only have one gripe...albeit a major one.  The game is devoid of an actual ""campaign"".  Sure, the main menu gives you the option of a ""campaign"", but it's not in the traditional sense.  The ""campaign"" is simply a series of multiplayer game sets.  There is no real story or substance.  It's basically just a drop ship dropping you into a multiplayer battle.  Shoot, shoot, shoot, earn a titan (a large robot that you can pilot), blow some things up for a bit, and if you win the battle, shoot down the opposing team's escape ship before it leaves for a bonus.  If you lose, get to the escape ship before you're blown up for a bonus.  That's it.  There is no character development, only character classes from which you can choose at the beginning of each battle.  Heck, there aren't really any characters to be heard of.  The lack of story really makes the game seem shallow and unltimately, boring.  I know there are a lot of multiplayer fans that will love this game and, as I said, it's not as if this game is ""bad"" per se.  I just prefer my blockbuster games to have an actual true campaign that contains a solid storyline and a bit of depth.

So, take this review for what it's worth.  I'm not trying to bash the game as I am simply stating that it's not really my cup of tea.  Multiplayer is a nice option, but I don't want a game that's multiplayer only.  While MP can be fun, it wears thin after a while.

The game's environment is muddy for the most part, there is a lot of brown everywhere you go.  I also don't see any environmental destruction.  If you shoot a wall with a titan's cannon gun, the wall is still standing after the smoke clears.  Enemies can hide behind a barrel the entire time, no matter how many missile shots it takes.  The story is worthless, I don't care about it or any of the characters in the game.  It's as if Respawn tried to create something meaningful, but what they delivered is not interesting at all.  Two factions are fighting over energy on different planets with no characters to base the story around, at least that's what I think is happening.  I understand I'm a grunt, but shouldn't there be somebody leading this story to its conclusion?  Each match basically boils down to running around and killing as many opponents as I can or capturing an enemy's flag.  I don't know why I'm doing it, but I'm doing it nonetheless.  ""Campaign"" mode is not a traditional campaign mode.  It's online multiplayer with the previously mentioned attempt at a story.  It is one online match after another, there is nothing to develop a story aside from banter by a couple of digital faces that appear on your screen via the HUD as they try to convey drama and a sense of desperation that simply is not there.

Speaking of online multiplayer, it's 6 vs. 6 at all times.  Why are there so few players on a next-gen console?  Instead of providing more human opponents, the game fills the maps with mindless bots who can be dropkicked (literally) to death as they stare at you with their guns pointed at you for 5 seconds.  Fighting these bots reminds me of the scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail where Sir Lancelot approaches the castle on a loop for about 30 seconds as the guards watch him the entire time.  They then seem surprised when he reaches them and stabs one with his sword, just like these bots are unsuspecting of your run toward them with your lethal dropkick prepared to impale them to their digital deaths.  The humans who are in the maps are mostly running around like chickens without heads spraying and praying until their 24-foot tall robot is available for occupation.  Once in the robots, the humans continue their spraying and praying tactics without trying to achieve any objectives, such as capturing the enemy's flag or a waypoint.  There is no organization as a team in this game, just people sprinting and floating with jetpacks in an attempt to get as many kills as possible so they can see a high number next to their name after the match is complete.  If you play with friends who are dedicated to playing the modes the way they're intended to be played, I'm sure the experience is slightly better.  But, if you're playing with strangers, it's an all-out mess of a rush with no direction.

The audio is decent, nothing spectacular is happening.  The sounds of gunfire are heavy and the footsteps of the titans are satisfying.  But, the audio isn't of a quality I haven't heard before.

In the end, this is just another frantic FPS with no real reason to play for an extended period of time other than trying to level up.  But, after leveling up, then what?  The weapons are not plentiful as in other FPS games, so the variety is pretty limited.  When playing Titanfall, I feel like I've already played the game a hundred times before, but with different titles.  Nothing about it says ""next-gen"" to me, nothing.  I feel like I'm playing Call of Duty on the 360, but with robots thrown into the mix and stupid bot enemies/teammates to make the experience even worse.  By the way, the novelty of robots wears quickly, especially after you see how fast they're destroyed by opponents.  A titan falls from the sky, gets a few rounds off, and then explodes seconds later because an entire team's attacking focus is on that titan.  Players wait 2 minutes for 15 seconds of robot action.

This game is not the recipe for excitement, longevity, next-gen gaming, or fun.  It is my opinion that this game was very much overhyped and not worthy of some of the high praise we have all seen.  I would not recommend it to a friend.

Titanfall does not hide what it is and that's a multiplayer game. How many people do you know that play Call of duty who go directly into the multiplayer without bothering to even touch the single player campaign, if you are like me then you know a lot of people like that. We have seen games lately which never bothered with a multiplayer to focus on the single player story and they have been acknowledged for their discipline. I can't imagine knocking a developer for doing the exact same thing but only this time they decided to strictly focus on multiplayer.

Pros:
Adrenaline filled matches
Noob friendly
comes with a large selection of maps
being able to parkour adds a new dimension never seen before in a shooter
everyone gets a Titan, the only question is how fast you get it

Cons:
Limited selection of weapons

Some people said the majority of the crowd cares only for MP.  I'm not sure.  I was thinking more about half and half.  If you've played Uncharted 2, that's a heck of a game well worth the $60: it got 15 or so hours of campaign, plus a very cool MP.  I think that's what makes a gamer feel like the money is worth it.

For people who care about having a game with good story, if Respawn works out a deal with Bandai, they can easily take the many rich stories of the Gundam series to make it a ton of money.  Even if they just start with the original story, and because it's pretty long, cutting it into one of two sequels (like Lord of the Rings, etc.) would surely be a big hit.  If I had the money, I would have done it.",03-19-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,3,Only Half A Game At Full Price,"I was certainly disappointed in this game after being psyched up for it from all the cherry picked reviews shown in commercials. Having enjoyed and still continue to enjoy Call of Duty Black Ops II and Black Ops, I was looking for the next step for the Call of Duty type of online multiplayer.
What really reeks in this game is the fact that the bots (non-human controlled players) are easy to take out. It is like having them handed to you on a platter. It's like going fishing but the fish have all been caught for you and placed in a small pool for you to fish in). Then there are the other players that play oblivious of their full capabilities.
Don't get me wrong, it can sometimes be fun for short spurts as you execute moves and work with your team. It can be downright sad, too, to watch and hear as you take down the big behemoths. The roaring sound may give some satisfaction but for me it was sad to watch as these big mechanical monsters go down. After all, you, too get to commandeer a machine to do your bidding. You can set it to protect an area as you do your own thing or you can be in control of it. That aspect of the game was fun.
This game is not meant to be played in a long time span. This is, after all, an online multiplayer through and through. It just sorely lacks a single player campaign to flesh out the story and give you a good background and feel for the story. It is kind of disturbing to me that given the time that the producers had that they could not come up with a single player campaign. I had read that the staffing for this production was smaller than a typical blockbuster production. And it shows. It is disturbing to think that this could be a trend for producing half games for full price. This is definitely NOT a killer app that some professional reviewers have anointed it to be. And it just confirms to me what others who have both systems, the Xbox One and PS4, have told me. The Xbox One is not all that it is cracked up to be. I think that I will be sticking with PS4 games in the future. I feel ripped off by this half game being packaged as a full game.
Pros:
1. Nice graphics
2. Great controls
3. AI for Titans are good
4. Parkour
5. Constant action
Cons:
1. Only half a game
2. AI for bots are bad
3. No single player campaign to flesh out a story
4. Full price for a game that should be added to a full campaign
5. Getting on a game can be a chore when linking up with Xbox Live
6. Gets old after doing the same thing over and over again
All in all, I would give this game a C minus. Had they included a 15-hour long single player, this game might have been the game to take the Call of Duty idea to the next level. It does feel next-gen. It just does not feel like a must-have game.",03-19-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,2,A small and soulless step forward,"Don't believe the hype: ""Titanfall"" is not a transcendent classic in gaming. Indeed it adds a variety of slight innovations to the traditional FPS format, but none are so groundbreaking and revelatory as this  ""Xbox One exclusive"" would like you to imagine. Perhaps it is one half of a great game, but there are numerous shortcomings which make one believe this was rushed to launch instead of being properly developed into a full experience.

""Players can scramble anywhere with crazy parkour!"" - See ""Brink"" or ""Mirror's Edge""
""Giant mechs are awesome!"" - From ""Lost Planet"" to ""Star Wars Battlefield,"" plenty of others have done it before and with far more personality in the bots.

What's most telling about the weaknesses of this game is how little attention is paid to the superfluous parts of the game beyond the online multiplayer. The campaign is minimal, there's no originality in design, and the ""story"" is completely forgettable. Future, space, aliens, whatever - ""Titanfall"" just wants you to plug in and shoot each other into oblivion in their generic and soulless sci-fi world.

There is much praise for the ""speed"" of the game, but really that just amounts to madcap scrambling and respawning, with hardly any unified strategy or teamwork. The touch and mechanics are identical to ""Call of Duty"" as well, for better or worse.

I would watch even the most experienced killers try and fail to execute various wall climbing/running maneuvers, making for a frustrating experience when you cannot get the character to do what you want it to.

Why no split-screen either? We have 2 systems even, but 4 players, so only half could play at a time. From other deficient features like the paucity of execution animations, the choppiness of the melee attack, to the dearth of weaponry, there is no doubt room to grow, but this version is half-baked at best.

It doesn't even look that great - The hud is both bland and muddled, while the environments feature little destruction of elemental flair.

This one is only for the most hardcore of FPS junkies. Its online base will predictably vanish soon once the mainstream gamer population realizes they've been duped. When our friends brought over the new ""Metal Gear"" and ""Dark Souls"" games, our group was all too eager to abandon this redundant shooter, since 10 minutes of play is the same as 100.",03-19-2014

Audio - 9/10 Clear in-game audio
Redundancy - 9/10 - Game is extremely redundant
Difficulty - Varies (online only)
Story - 1/10 - It has an online campaign mode but lacks any substance to the story.
Online Play - 5/10 Gets boring quick
Overall Game Play - 3/10

This game needs a lot of work! While it is mildly entertaining, there are still quite a few bugs to iron out. I think Respawn made a mistake by not offering a single player campaign, I usually will not give a game a second thought if it does not offer the Single Player Campaign, however because I had friends getting this I decided to bite the bullet and try it.

Now, aside from the lack of single player mode; there is absolutely not $60 worth of content here. If they want an online only game then there should be many more maps and match types and introducing mods to change the flow of things would be great! There simply isn't enough variety, this game gets very redundant very quick I was bored within a few hours of game play. Players also have no ability to choose a preferred faction, there is also no option to choose a map (or let players vote on the next map to be played, it is all random, you choose your match type and you are randomly thrown in, replaying the Campaign is the same thing.

Someone had compared this to an MMO is defense of its online only restriction and well, just about every successful MMO offers a wide array of single player missions and PvP is optional. If they wanted online only that is fine but offer a co-op campaign for the players.

For FPS games, any good game should have and focus on the Single Player Campaign, the online play is just a perk; another way to play the game, it is a nice bonus for the price paid for a full game. FPS do not really make good online only games. It absolutely feels like I paid full price for a third of a game!

This game had huge potential, they really could have made something with Titanfall! I feel like the developers really let the players down with this one, I don't know if they just didn't feel like making it a complete game or didn't know how to tie it into a story mode but it absolutely feels like a half-butt effort.

So, if an online only FPS is what your looking for then this game may be great for you but I would advise you wait for the price to drop, new content to be added (though they will charge you again for any new content) and work out some of the ""new game"" bugs.

I really wanted this game so I wanted it to be awesome. After the honeymoon ended (24hrs later btw) I was disappointed. When the smoke settled, I realized I was playing a game that consisted of shooting AI controlled bots, then maybe a real person (pilots) every now and then, jump into a mech and shoot mechs. Then die, then repeat. LITERALLY that is all that you can do. Shoot something, die, respawn, shoot something, die, respawn..your titan will be ready in 2 minutes, die, respawn in titan, shoot bots, die, respawn. Get the picture? Yea I get that COD and Battlefield were more or less the same however COD has different gimmicks to balance out the game and left those completely in control of the player. Titanfall misses the mark by putting everyone in the same playing field for fairness. If you must try this game, buy it used or ask a friend to borrow it. There is nothing else to it; to up the replay. And the story is so bland that you have no idea what all the cut scenes and stuff are about so these are worthless. Something about being a group of soliders defending a mining colony or something. Alot of people are jumping all over this game and I was too at first.

It's not a BAD experience, it's just not what it could be.  By comparison, I have a PC that doesn't quite meet the *minimum* specs, and it plays the game a little better than my Xbox One does.  Normally I'd stick with the Xbox One anyway because I prefer to play with a controller, but the PC version has excellent gamepad support.

So in a nutshell, if you have an Xbox One and not a PC that can handle the game, by all means get it:  it's fantastic.  But if you have a PC, the experience is better there in my opinion.  The game also scales down to lesser PC's VERY very well.",03-17-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,2,Not good enough,"This is supposed to be Xbox One's flagship game that was so hyped up with the release of the new system.  What I have experienced over the last week and through the Beta is just not enough to carry that weight.

Let me highlight the good about this game as a purely PVP multiplayer.  It is definitely entertaining.  The controls are great, and the game is gorgeous.  It is a lot of fun and easy in terms of match making.  The weapons have great control, even though there are not that many to choose.  The upgrades are interesting and somewhat easy to achieve.

Now let me discuss what I think is wrong with this game.  The bots are a complete waste.  At first I thought I was unstoppable, until I realized that for every 4 or 5 kills that I made, only 1 of those were an actual human player.  I think the problem is that the boards are just too big, and without the bots, you cannot even find anything to shoot.  Having said that, however, once the Titans start to drop in, the board gets a lot smaller.  I understand the challenge that the developers have here, but I am not encouraged by their solution.

I could complain about the Titans themselves, but I knew what I was getting into when I bought the game.  The multiplayer just gets so repetitive and tedious once the Titans drop in.

Here is the principal issue that I have with this game:  Without a real campaign, I have no character to identify with.  All of the quality FPS games that I have played in the past have had some campaign (good or bad) where there is a real character that we progress and develop through a story.  Without that, I really have no connection to this universe at all.  Take COD for example, all of the campaign modes were done with real story telling and had such a quality of production that added so much to the experience.  Many of the voice actors were A-List movie stars.  The same could be said about other games (Tom Clancy, Assasin's Creed, GTA).  Without strong character development, what would those experiences have been like?

I knew that this game did not come with a real campaign, but I was still interested.  Going forward, I will not even consider a game that does not have a compelling story.

Respawn are talented game makers, but I think they lack heavily in story telling.  For those that are just interested in multiplayer and want to shoot things, then you might love this game.  For those looking for more than just shooting a gun, I think you will be disappointed.

Also Respawn has already announced that they will be adding both free and paid DLC, one thing they already announced is a private mode where you can host private games, also they've announced that the game may receive a patch in the near future to make it run at native 900p or even native 1080p but they're not promising.",03-16-2014

Further, if there are network problems, and there are tons of them, the online experience is at best annoying with the short match and long intermissions and at worst not even playable during outages. Heck, the network has been up but every several of matches I get locked up and have to restart.

Could be a great game but the reliance 100% on xbox having no network issues is a gamble that could potentially hurt the lifespan of the game. (People will buy but future dlc releases may suffer poor sales as people get fed up of network issues and move on to more reliable games)

I would not buy.. I would wait, maybe even consider  buying on xbox 360 instead of xbox one. (Btw - the graphics are good but more on the levels of  the 360 not the new current gen.. Actually it feels more of a port from the last gen to this gen)

I really feel that this game has a lot of marketing and hype around it and for now it is fun but as soon as the next call of duty, halo, or battlefield come out this will take a  permanent. backseat",03-16-2014

Darn, it looks great and plays like a dream. It's not some quantum leap forward in terms of gameplay and graphics, but I would call it something of a move forward. However, I was aware before I bought this that it didn't have a single player campaign, and I think that this just cries out for it, especially if Microsoft and EA expect this game to be the biggest selling point for the Xbox One. Don't forget guys, there are some of us who much prefer a single player campaign. Then again, and to illustrate my indecisiveness about this review, it's a whole lot of fun anyway and I hope that EA wait a long, long time before doing there usual trick of pulling down the game servers, something they have hit people with far too many times.
At that point, this game becomes nothing more than a drinks coaster. In the end though, I'm happy with my purchase, having a ball playing this, but I can't help but think this should have been single player also.

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,2,The same game we've been playing for a decade with online-only restrictions.,"I'm a huge fan of the XB1, and I'm one of the outnumbered ones who is standing by this system over the PS4. I'm not taking a jab at the Xbox for the sake of trolling by giving this game a low score. I wanted Titanfall to be good, but it didn't have to be for me to enjoy my system. Unfortunately, it turns out that it actually is not very good. When your internet connection and the servers are working properly, it's a decent game, but the online limitation doesn't sit well with me, and the justification for making it online-only is completely bogus. Using the cloud to control AI didn't make the AI any noticeably better, and focusing solely on multiplayer didn't help improve anything about the multiplayer experience compared to the huge variety of excellent FPS games already on the market, many of which have offline play options.

Here's the main issue right out of the gate: the multiplayer experience offered by Titanfall has not improved over 2004's Halo 2 and most other top tier FPS games that have come out in the past 10 years. Honestly, hook up Halo 2 to an online LAN server via widely available software, and you can play it online to this day. Hook it up to another Xbox and you can do local matches without an internet connection. Alternatively, you could play single player. Without system link, LAN, or single player, Titanfall gives the player less. It's likely that Titanfall will never function properly without an internet connection, and the day the servers are shut off, the game won't be playable. In 2004, if your internet was terrible or lost service, you had options to play your games offline fully featured in every single game mode. In 2014: no internet, no game. We've seen this before from EA. Sim City was plagued by the same issue, and the justification was similar: they said they needed the online connection to control the citizen AI. That turned out to be a lie. They didn't need that at all. The online-only was done simply to combat piracy. Even so, the pirates cracked the game and were enjoying it offline. It was the paying customers who suffered. Titanfall is no different. You get the same basic game you got back in 2004, which is a good game, but you get no single player, you get no offline options, and you get nothing drastically new.

Titanfall features huge robots called titans which you call down to fight alongside you or to pilot manually. Having a titan fight by your side seems cool, but I've seen my titan stand there shooting the ground and other ridiculous things. When all is said and done, titans are nothing more than a glorified vehicle, no better than piloting a vehicle in any other FPS game. They aren't exciting and new. They're vehicles which can follow you around if you want. Imagine if your vehicle in Halo followed you around and shot at people while you weren't riding it: that's basically what it comes down to. It's not innovative enough to simply have titans in the game and just make everything else the same as usual. A deathmatch in Titanfall is still a deathmatch. A capture point game is still a capture point game. I mean, heck, every player gets a titan in every match, usually twice. In other FPS games at least you could fight for control of the various vehicles in a level. In Titanfall the only way to gain any advantage over anyone else is to try to lower the time you are waiting until the titan is ready by playing better than the other people, but getting your titan 15 seconds earlier isn't nearly as useful as simply stealing the level's only vehicle spawn in a different FPS game.

On that note, Titanfall really fails to give the skilled players much to set themselves apart in general. Not only do all players get the chance to have a titan on every level regardless of how they play, but there is an auto-aim homing bullet gun which does 1-2 hit kills, and its only drawback is that it takes a slightly longer time to fire it. This means that some guy aiming in your general vicinity might be able to kill you in a couple seconds without any sort of skill. The idea behind this is to level the playing field to make the game less daunting for people who stink at FPS games, but it's really counter to the spirit of playing one of these games. You'r supposed to have to aim and shoot at your opponent. Giving people the option to be lazy may cater to the new players, but it's not making the game a better game.

Along the same lines, the game will let people contribute to the team score by killing AI bots who run around the levels, and spawn in large numbers in various sections of the map. You'd think the AI would still be a fair challenge to kill, like fighting grunts and elites in Halo or something, but it's not like that at all. The AI bots are idiots who barely do more than stand there while you kill them. Farming the AI is exactly that: farming. It's not challenging or engaging in any way. Without any effort, I could mow down 5 of them at a time.

One neat thing is that Titanfall lets you run at high speeds at all times, and you can run along walls or jump from wall to wall. It's a fun mechanic, and it's simple to do, but it's hardly worth buying the game for. Limitations in mobility in other FPS games don't make those games any less strategic or fun. Sonic the Hedgehog runs faster than Mario and can run upside-down. Is Sonic more fun to play than Mario? It's just a different game with its own rules. There's nothing wrong with Titanfall's mechanics, but it's not worth buying the game for.

Along with these thoughts, I'm also rolling my eyes at the slow pace the developers have taken with making the game look next-gen. A bunch of cool effects don't change the fact that the game is launching at 792p, when most people expect next gen to run at 1080p. I can understand that launch titles weren't running at full specs due to time constraints and developers learning to use the new hardware, and the 60 frames per second is nice, but you're looking at a game which is supposed to really sell you on the next gen experience. Lighting effects are nice, but people want 1080p 60 frames per second before they want all the cool effects. It's sad to see the XB1's early system seller failing to at least meet that standard on time for launch.

All that being said, Titanfall is a game I could recommend to someone really itching for a online first person shooter, but for anyone else, stay away. If you're a casual gamer looking for a game to play on your new XB1, go for Dead Rising 3 or something with the ability to play by yourself without the internet. In 10 years, when the Titanfall servers are shut down, and you want to revisit your old XB1, you'll be a lot happier if you stick with games that don't require an internet connection. Don't get me wrong, online games have their place, but it takes a lot more to justify them than Titanfall offers.",03-15-2014

This game is more, you have to think about how you want to do a simple task such as crossing the street... you can jump building to building, sprint, zip-line, or call in a titan and take 1 step...  I do not understand how people can be so disappointed with this game.... it has great graphics, gameplay, features, and everything... only thing i have to complain about is the join in progress that always happens to me.... it's annoying when 90% of your games you play you join towards the end when your team is behind by a few hundred points...

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,3,Flashes of Next Gen Gameplay with No Sign of Next Gen Graphics,"Gameplay:  The gameplay is good and can be a lot of fun for casual gamers.  Matches are fast-paced, weapons seem a little unbalanced, but playing as both pilot and Titan offer several innovative features such as par-core, double-jumping when you play as a pilot, and a variety of neat offensive and defensive weapons when you play as a Titan.  Titans aren't overpowered, can be earned easily, and can be killed just as easily.  Getting a Titan amounts to getting temporary superpowers or a kill streak.  Map design is top-notch as expected.  Unfortunately, the low number of human opponents and the high number of rather stupid enemy bots, are real weak points to the game, because it's difficult to distinguish between bots and humans, and mowing down a bunch of bots, who initially have the upper hand on you, just isn't very rewarding.  If the matches were 10 v 10 humans (at a minimum) with a few less bots, the longevity of the game might increase significantly.

Graphics:  Any reviews you've read saying that Titanfall is beautiful graphically are simply being dishonest.  At the highest settings, the game looks comparable to Homefront, is noticeably less impressive than Black Ops II, and is simply put to shame by both Battlefield 3 and especially Battlefield 4.  In fact, both Tomb Raider and Battlefield 4 on the PS4 look and run significantly better than Titanfall, at the highest settings, on PC.  So if graphics are important to you, Titanfall is definitely not the game for you.  Additionally, the color schemes are quite bland with pale green, beige, and light brown schemes without a lot of contrast, which can make it very difficult at times to identify enemies hiding in plain sight.

Verdict:  For the casual gamer who enjoys chaotic battles that don't require a lot of skill or the hard-core gamer who wants the occasional distraction from his or her competitive shooter of choice.  While I think the gameplay is good, the game lacks any longevity because of the lack of human players and the abundance of distractive, stupid enemy bots.  $60 is definitely about $30 too steep to pay for this game.  If you want to play the game on console, my gut tells me that both the XBOX One and XBOX 360 versions will have identical gameplay (hence the delay in launching the XBOX 360 version).  So you're probably better off getting the XBOX 360 version of the game to experience flashes of next gen gameplay, without having to shell out the cash for a new system on the false promise of experiencing next gen graphics, which simply are not part of the Titanfall package.",03-15-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,3,Good game but not enough.,"I only rated it 3/5 stars simply because the game is good but lacks some things. The graphics are great, and the gameplay is flawless (little to no bugs, no lag time, good connection, speedy and flawless moving etc.) My main issue with the game is the campaign and amount of things to unlock. Weapons don't have a large choice, titans are also lacking with choices and weapons mainly.

The campaign was also too short to enjoy mainly because it wasn't a single player campaign with a great story line but rather multi-player that included players that had already beaten the campaign playing on the opposite team/faction. I found this to be a jab because I had though that the campaign would have been longer and more immersed than what we were given.

All in all only *** is what I give this game only because I believe that could have added more but then again it probably will but only through season pass which players will obviously have to shell out an additional 50.00 to gain access to more weapons, maps, characters, etc.

Hopefully EA see's this as I am not the only one and develop a more hands on approach to the game where we have more choices to what we're playing because I don't see this game as a long term game I would play everyday compared to a game such as Halo or FIFA just as an example.",03-15-2014

When I was little, the idea of playing games over the internet on consoles was a distant idea. I'm 29, so I was raised on Nintendo's Mario, then grew into Killer Instinct, and eventually Halo. I loved the Halo series and to this day it remains a game that changed a lot of what it means to be a ""gamer."" Online play was incredibly fun, however the story of Halo and really most games are what keeps me coming back. I second it only to movies as far as edge of the seat goodness. I can't help but feel like Titanfall is just missing something. There's an attempt at a story but I have no idea what it means. Don't get me wrong here. The free running mech battling goodness is really, really fun. I just would REALLY have loved to see a story developed. My character is just a nameless body who goes by my Xbox Live Gamertag. No substance gets a star knocked off. It feels like a really advanced arcade game which blends multiplayer of 50/50 Call of Duty and Halo with giant mechs. The story that could be developed here is RIPE. I really hope EA and other brains behind this game hear these types of pseudo complaints. I hate to knock the game too much as the gameplay and fun level are pretty high up there. With a story campaign this could have been a solid 5 star rating, and a triple A game.

It will feel familiar to you if you are used to playing Call of Duty , classes , perks , load outs ( for your pilot and your titan ). Absolutely everything you would expect to be in an epic multiplayer FPS..

I just can't recommend this game enough , it truly is what I needed to break up the monotony of call of duty and battlefield.. this is a solid 5 out of 5..",03-13-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,2,"Fun for just a little while but terrible ""story"" and repetitive.","Amazon is doing the unheard of and removing reviews arbitrarily. Personally, I come to Amazon and check reviews (and leave reviews) for any product they sell, even if I bought it elsewhere. Played the PC version and seen the XBoxOne version, and they're about the same except for the major downgrade in graphical fidelity on the One. It has to be downright bad on the 360.

Gameplay does get repetitive quickly and it really seems like there should be more real players on each map at once. It doesn't need to be 40, but 20 seems reasonable. Not as innovative as some sites make it out to be. I honestly, seriously, do not understand the high reviews from some sites.",03-13-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,Excellent game!,This game is really not what I expected. I didn't think the whole Titan dropping in and you controlling it would work. It seemed like it would be way too overpowered but I was wrong. There is a good balance thrown in there. It's a lot easier too take one of these things out than expected. This is a really good thing because he wants to have a group of Titans going around the whole time beating on you. The running on walls is great for the most part. I'm still getting used to it so maybe i'll feel differently about it once I've got alittle more experience with it down. The people saying there is no campaign in this game is wrong. They have campaign it's just online. You do the campaign against other players. It's not that bad it actually makes the campaign a lot of fun. The graphics are pretty good. They are crisp but you can tell the frame rate has alittle trouble when the action picks up. It's not a real big deal it's hardly noticeable unless you know what your looking for. This is a great game you really just need to purchase and try it out for yourselves.,03-13-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,Only have 2 problems with it,"First of all, my REAL review score is 4/5. I gave it a perfect 5/5 though, because I really think that people are just giving it a low score for no reason at all. I'm pretty sure a lot of them didn't even play it to be reviewing it so low. But back to my review.

One problem I have with it is the framerate. I expected a buttery smooth, solid 60fps. That's not what I got. The framerate is usually fine, unless it's getting crazy! Explosions, particles here and there, etc. This is also a very fast paced game, so 60fps would've helped tremendously.

My other problem is the Engine they used. I forgot the name of it, but the game engine is very old. I think something like 10 years old. For a next-gen game, I expected better.

With that said though, this game is VERY fun. I usually play with my 4 friends. The wall-running is so addictive, that I do it for no reason lol. I'll wall run by a crate next to me. Why? I don't know lol.

My favorite game mode so far is Last Titan Standing, because it reminds me of MechAssault, and I was OBSESSED with that game!",03-13-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,1,Overhyped game,Gets dull after a while....wouldn't recommend you pay 60 dollars just for the online multiplayer especially for those that don't have live since its mandatory for it,03-13-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,A quick summary,"What I like...
Being that the motion/movement is similar to ""Mirror's Edge,"" traffic flow is what I like most about this title.  With this, there really isn't any camping and there aren't really any choke points that slows down the gameplay which also rewards high player mobility.  This game requires a good level of awareness being that flanking can come from any angle.

What I don't like...
There is a ""campaign"" mode which is simply multiplayer with some dialog.  The story is so incomplete that is gives the feeling that you're playing a demo.  There could be much more variety in weapons and attachments!  There is generally one gun for each type of weapon (AR, SMG, Burst AR, marksman rifle, sniper rifle) along with about five anti-titan weapons.  A decent number of ""perks"" gives some flexibility and variability in playstyle, but when comparing to CoD or BF4, it lacks in number.  I do complain a lot about how a simple ""kick"" from the front can kill you in one hit as well.  A melee being an instant kill from the rear makes sense....from the front does not.  At least allow countering.

Added notes...
I do enjoy playing this game and the fact that it allows for such a mixture of playing styles and how the controls and movement contribute to a more ""run and gun"" play-style being heavily rewarding.  I just wish it had more variety in actual weapons and attachments.  It's hard to beat down a game that essentially promotes being highly mobile which obviously takes a much higher level of skill versus sitting in a corner or looking out a window.

All questions are welcome!",03-13-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,2,This is what the hype was all about?,"This game will be just like Gears of War series. The first one will be mind blowing because its a new IP no one has heard about along the hype of  ""______ is developing the game"". Like many has said it looks like COD with robots. Even from the commercial's slow motion i felt like it was a COD DLC commercial. So yeah it's very easy to pickup n play, i didn't have any lag issues. I donnot think this will be the game that will make users jump shift from COD to titanfall as this one is probably a every 2/ half years game release not a yearly release....It also waited months before/after COD release because I""m sure they didn't want to go head to head with COD, smart for business maybe but titanfall was hyped up to be a big AAA game so I don't see why they didn't go for COD season release from Sept-December. Then that's when you know the developers are confident in their game. Releasing alone with no competition makes it seem like they only held the game off to get some easy sells in the drought of no games releasing.....",03-13-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,1,NOT Next Gen,"Titanfall has a few novel ideas, but this is NOT a next-gen game in any way shape or form.  There are many issues/annoyances with this game, just to name a few: 1) 792p is ridiculous, 2) multiplayer is 6v6 only, 3) no single player or offline, 4) graphics look ancient, 5) limited game play modes that are the same old variants, 6) as many have said this is simply COD with mechs, 7) day 1 outages and ongoing issues with being kicked from servers while playing, 8) many seemingly basic features simply left out of the game (e.g map voting, clans, etc., etc.).  Titanfall really just feels like a hacked up very crude version of an OLD COD game...it's nowhere nearly as fun or polished as COD.  Also, many are burnt out on the COD formula, and this is just more of the same old stuff.  This was a decent idea for a game...but the gaming community really didn't need/want a tweaked COD clone.  Titanfall may generate some sales because Xbox One owners are so starved for something new...but Titanfall is not the ""next-gen"" title that is a must have for Xbox One owners... that must have game is yet to come.  As far as the stellar ""critic"" reviews of Titanfall...the credentials and motives of the so called critics are questionable at best.  I played the beta and I own the game on Xbox One so that is the basis of my review. In summary Titanfall is simply not that great of a game...saying it was average or even a bit below average is in fact a fair assessment.  Rent it or go play with a friend first.",03-13-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,A seismic shift forward in the FPS genre,"At the Xbox One launch, I reluctantly purchased Call of Duty: Ghosts and instantly regretted the decision. The thrill that I had when I played Call of Duty 4 urged me to continue purchasing the annual release, but with each year's release (Especially beginning with MW3, BlOps2, and now Ghosts) it is blatently clear that the FPS formula is tired and uninspired (honestly having few major refinements since Quake). Call of Duty: Ghosts made me sad. Call of Duty: Ghosts made me feel like the FPS genre (that I love) was running on fumes and had nothing left to do to reinvent itself. Then the Titanfall beta happened.

Titanfall feels familiar to Call of Duty in the button configuration and basic mechanics, but the addition of jetpacks brings the consideration of verticality into the players equation. While ""camping"" had its benefits in COD, this is not the case in Titanfall. The verticality forces the player to continue moving as there are few ""safe"" areas to camp. Similarly, the inclusion of jetpacks for brief double jumps and wall runs creates opportunity to scale many buildings and jump across rooftops. I found myself having to relearn the FPS formula as Titanfall's fluidity offered so many more options for the player.

Graphically, the game looks great (not outstanding). But that is second to the level design and sharp controls. If you want a game that looks great (at the expense of gameplay) please buy Ryse. If you want a game that plays well and truly feels ""next gen,"" Titanfall is the game for you.

Unlike others, I do not have a problem with the lack of a single player campaign. There is an ""attempt"" at a campaign (labeled ""campaign"") but i'm not sure I could write a one-sentence synopsis. But is that really a bad thing? Many FPS gamers only pay attention to the multiplayer component and this practice (of not including a single player campaign) isn't being pioneered by Respawn here. It's a AAA title without a single player (but with a REALLY good multiplayer).

My only gripe is a lack of multiplayer diversity. One would think that if the game lacks a single player then it would be brimming with multiplayer options. That isn't the case here. Don't get me wrong, the included modes are fun (expect for ""Last Titan Standing""), but I do think more variety would be nice. Articles on the web suggest that DLC and updates should add modes (and up resolution. Gotta have more ""P"" because more ""P"" is better! Sigh. This resolution bit reminds me to the ""bit"" wars of the 90's. Few could tell you what a bit was then, few can explain the significance of a game in marginally higher resolution now.)

Pros:
+ Spectacular controls and gameplay
+ Takes the FPS genre forward by throwing verticality and significant movement into the equation
+ Good, balanced maps
+ Nice balance between pilots and titans
+ Great (not outstanding graphics)
+ Good online service (no server problems to date)

Cons:
- Lack of variety in multiplayer

4.75/5 (Five Stars)",03-13-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,Believe the hype,"Don't believe the nay-sayers.  They basically fall into two camps.

1. They want a single player game
This group really needs to reevaluate why the bought a game marketed as one of the first solely multiplayer games looking for a single player element. If I bought Tomb Raider and complained about the lack of team death match multiplayer, that isn't a fair assessment of the game's quality because it never set out to be what I'm looking for. In other words, you can't complain about the lack of a feature that was never promised, intended, or within the scope of the game.

2. They are insatiable
These gamers are becoming the bane of gaming. Nothing, and I mean nothing, is ever good enough.  Both Battlefield and COD launch their titles riddled with problems and bugs. This game, as far as I can tell, runs almost flawless.  Even the beta ran beautifully with only a few server hiccups.  And yet people posture unimpressed and bored with a game that has taken us to new heights of intense cinematic online gaming.  I jumped on the back of a buddies titan, jumped off, ran along a wall, double jumped onto a roof, and laid into an enemy titan with a sidewinder.  You can't do that in any other game and have such a smooth and amazing experience.

This game is easily one of the most amazing multiplayer shooters I have ever played.  Graphics are fantastic, weapons and mechs are smooth and diverse, maps are big yet small for a variety of battles and encounters.  Everything about this game screams next gen and fun.",03-13-2014

All those who designed Xbox One should be fired!,"[I AM AN AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASER]  Folks reading reviews should look to see if the reviewer is an ""Amazon Verified Purchaser"".  If not, then take their review with a grain of salt as they're likely a fanboy of XO or PS4. I have both and want both systems to succeed.  That said, TITANFALL is fun but it it runs like garbage on the Xbox One hardware.  Get ready for some clunky play when the frames per second dip significantly during intense moments (which happens alot) and constant screen tear.  I'm shocked they couldn't make this run smoother than it does since its only 792p resolution.  They should just drop it down to 480p to get a consistent framerate.  Pretty disappointed.  Everyone who designed Xbox One should be fired for building such a weak machine that's supposed to last us the next 10 yrs.  Its 4 months old and can't run its flagship exclusive title smoothly?  I'm a frustrated customer.  I don't give a rat's azz about talking to my console!  Take the goofy Kinect back and give me the 10% boost in power to help run games like Titanfall a little better.  I debated buying this for PC in order to get a better experience however I wanted to use a controller and play against others who are using controllers instead of playing against opponents on Mouse/Keyboard.  I thought since Microsoft was putting so much marketing into this game that most of the wrinkles would be ironed out.  Nope.  Its pretty rough.  But again, it IS a fun game if you're willing to compromise smoothness.  (Disclaimer: I have both an XO and PS4. Plus 360, PC fwiw)",03-13-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,3,Ehhhh,"Titanfall is WAY over-hyped and not worth the purchase of an Xbox One as the Xbox 360 version will be nearly identical.  It is a fun casual game that you pickup and play without the worry of being good as there are plenty of bots to shoot.  These bots rarely shoot back and are there for the purpose of making the game feel action packed.  I am not a fan of the modes, graphics, frame-rate issues, campaign, or even the concept but I will admit it is fun to throw on and play for a few.

This is merely a version of COD with added Mechs and CPU fillers.  There isn't much variety and it is incredibly casual.  No leaderboards, no private rooms, and a terrible ranking system make me not want to keep playing.  I do not see myself playing this game every night and probably not at all a few months from now.  Not NEXT-GEN at all.",03-13-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,Solid multiplayer experience and well worth the wait,"Titanfall has finally dropped and I'm happy to say this much, the fact that the game lived up to the months of hype that it generated since its reveal nearly a year ago says a lot. Titanfall is a lot of fun to play and in the end, that's all that really matters. The game looks great, with detailed backgrounds and graphics. A big fuss was made over the fact that the game is output at a resolution of 792p instead of 1080p. These arguments are silly. If you're looking for the best graphics you've ever seen in your life, then look elsewhere. Titanfall is all about the gameplay. It's a breath of fresh air in the first person shooter genre, a game that is guaranteed to get you involved as you wade into battles with your friends.

The controls are absolutely wonderful, polished to perfection and completely intuitive. Before you know it, you'll be wall running and jumping in and out of your mech like if it were second nature. The sound is good also, with weapons packing a nice aural punch and surround sound used to great degrees.

A campaign has been shoehorned in and I'd be lying if I told you that I paid any attention to what was going on in it. The campaign is basically multiplayer matches with a bit of a story going on. Now, I don't know about you but trying to pay attention to the dialogue while avoiding death is just something of an impossibility. It's nice that it was included but it wasn't really necessary in the end.

I want to stress that the game is really meant to be played online with no single player component whatsoever. If you're looking for single player, this isn't the game for you and I cannot recommend it under those restrictions.

Titanfall is THE Xbox One game to own right now and very well the game on next gen consoles to own in general, period. Thinking back on last night's session and listening to my buddies marveling at the insanity that was erupting all around them last night, I'm completely confident in making that claim.",03-13-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,9 - The Next Big Thing,"Titanfall is challenging and engaging.  Titanfall makes you feel important.  Titanfall is designed and balanced with precision and expertise.  But most of all Titanfall is fun.  Way too much fun.

Developed by Respawn Entertainment (former developers of CoD 4: Modern Warfare) comes Titanfall, a futuristic fast-paced rock-em sock-em robot parkour simulator.  It's easy to recommend this game, especially to anyone who loves multiplayer games.  But for me, I couldn't be more satisfied with the purchase.  I plugged in hundreds of hours into Halo 3 and CoD MW 2.  I remember late nights, chilling in the forge with my buddies and early mornings getting an attack helicopter after countless rounds.  Since then, I've had no interest in multiplayer.  Sure, the past Halo games had great multiplayer but nothing to encourage those same hundreds of hours I've clocked before.  Battlefield 4 was a bust due to its extended online connectivity issues.  For me, multiplayer love was all riding on this game being great right out of the gate.  If the guys that changed the face of multiplayer once, they could do it again.

And indeed they have.

Story and Presentation - 7/7 = 7

I'll get this right of my chest: Titanfall 2 needs to have some sort of exploration of its fiction in the sequel.  The fiction of Titanfall is rich with diverse ideas, awesome sci-fi creations and creatures coupled with awesome designs for nearly everything.  Titanfall's single player component comes in the form of a multiplayer campaign, which works in certain ways (introducing you to specific characters, giving fictitious backdrops to the maps) but not in other ways (exploring the incredible world, feeling important, or diving deep into the characters).  The menus are fairly bare-bones as well.  Featuring static images for all characters, titans, and backgrounds, it would've been great to see 3D models or epic backgrounds at least.  This is where Titanfall stumbles the most.

Graphics and Art Direction - 10/10 = 10

Titanfall looks gorgeous, and that's a fact.  Running at a (most of the time) blistering 60 frames per second, Titanfall looks and feels great.  Lighting effects are sharp and crisp, explosions look devastating, and the game is incredibly well animated.  Titans feel lumbering yet agile, while pilots respond with great animations when wall running, jumping, shooting among other things.  Textures also look sharp and clear, with not a muddy one in site.  Of course, there are some anti-aliasing issues and screen tearing issues at launch, but those can be easily patched post-launch.  The art direction for Titanfall is the best I have ever seen for a multiplayer-only game.  Stunning backdrops of epic dog fights in space, huge futuristic ship yards, and space dragons swirling in the sky are amongst the few awesome and breathtaking scenes you'll witness while you're kicking dudes in the face.  The design for each class of titan looks inspired and fresh, while the pilots all have different looks depending on class chosen.  The art direction team at Respawn has some massive chops; Titanfall is simply a stunning game to look at.

Sound = 10

Turn up the bass and let this game melt your face off.  Titanfall sounds absolutely fantastic.  From the steely crunch of Titan on Titan fisticuffs, to the light pattering of pilots as they wall run across a gap to the exciting chatter of bots (that actually correspond with the action going on around them) Titanfall's sound design is absolute perfection.  It's big, it's loud, and it'll blow you away.  The voice work and chatter of you friendly compatriots throughout battle is both fairly well written and delivered well.  The balance between important dialogue and intense gameplay never seems to lean one way or the other too heavily, creating a nice balanced effect every match.  Surprisingly, the soundtrack here really stuck out to me.  Composed by Stephen Barton (MGS 3), the soundtrack accentuates on the drama each match.  Jump into your titan and the music will blare deep a chorus of trumpets and dark brass.  Depending on your side, the music is also different and changes according to the position your team has in the match.  Most will not even notice it, which is the sign of a great soundtrack.  But for me, soundtracks can really accentuate dramatic moments of a game or movie, and the composer and mixing team at Respawn has done a great job at doing so.

Gameplay = 10

At the end of the day, Titanfall will boil down to it's gameplay.  Is it fun?  You bet your sweet cheeks.  Is it easy for non-shooter veterans to get into?  Depending if you can easily abandon and learn a whole new set of tactics and combine them with the incredible mobility of the pilot and the intense Titan combat, that's up to you.  For me, getting this game in my hands and playing a few hours solidified how good this game feels.  Simply put, everything works in tandem like it should.  Wallrunning feels smooth, gunplay is tight, titans control as they should, melees aren't magnetic, and killing another player/grunt features a satisfying ripping noise.  Everything here is top notch, impressively well balanced, and fun as all get-out.  One of the biggest complaints is that the bots aren't smart or lethal.  On the contrary, I feel they've been amped a little bit since the beta.  But these little guys are simply there to keep the match going forward, and it makes every match feel much more exciting and kinetic.  The various game modes (while low on the count - 5 available at launch) they all have the quirks and tricks, making each mode entertaining.  (Respawn claims additional modes will be available post launch for free).  Titanfall also features 15 (15!!!) maps right out of the gate.  All are unique, balanced in their own ways, and top notch in terms of design.  Each map can be played with all game types, and feature all sorts of hidden passages and unique mobility opportunities.  I'll leave the experiences of playing titanfall to you, but there will be many an epic moment while playing Titanfall.  Burn Cards are temporary stat boosts and weapon enhancements that you earn through various challenges each match, and there are no micro transactions to get these.  That ""one more round"" mentality is gonna come creeping back.

Lasting Appeal = 9

Titanfall features a hefty amount of content right out of the gate.  A fun, if frivolous, multiplayer campaign.  15 maps, 5 game modes and a whole lot of challenges.  10 prestige generations to work through, and a great and balanced arsenal just waiting to be unlocked.  Titanfall has a metric crap-ton of things to see and do, but it plays it safe and doesn't stray too far from the pack.  It would've been fantastic to see unlockable art, story clips, fiction exploration journals...something to enhance and expand upon the fiction of this incredible game.  If you're all about unlocks, gun enhancements and fun new toys for your titan, then Titanfall will please those endorphins in your brain.

The Verdict: 9.2 (an average) rounds to 9.0

Titanfall is fun, frenetic and polished like no other shooter of this caliber has been for years.  This game is a joy to play, even when you're having a bad round.  Titanfall makes you feel important every match, with exciting moments and explosive battles at every turn.  Titanfall feels like the first fresh step forward for shooters in quite sometime.  Respawn has taken the baggage of multiplayer shooters and given it a facelift, and it's name is Titanfall.",03-13-2014

Why did I knock it .5 stars NO CAMPAIGN they say there is but its a bunch of audio files before a bunch of online matches.  Its not a campaign and I am hoping this is not a trend I enjoy my campaigns.  I liked the ghost campaign I love single player games like Fallout, Bioshock and Assassins Creed (AC).  I really really think this should have been like $50.00 since no campaign.  OK that's the bad know the good.

This is the BEST multiplayer game I have ever played, better than any COD, Medal of Honor, Battlefield or AC.  Yes I am not saying this as hype.  I am an average to poor COD player, being over the age of 40 my reflexes are not so good.  With this game it can suit any play style and on hard point I have been the best player on my team about 25% of the time.  The game is fast, fun and addictive.  I love the controls they are PERFECT, the maps some I love some I like but 15 is  LOT that is the plus to no campaign they give us lots of maps.  The perks to leveling are great and the titans are fun but you can work around them if necessary.  I am impressed it would be 6 stars for the multilayer portion re spawn nailed it.  I cant think of one complaint to it, ok maybe waiting 90 seconds for the game to start.  This is why I bought an xbox one this game is that good.

You need to like FPS but if you have not in the past this is still the game to try.  I am not a huge online multiplayer guy use to be 3-4 hours a week but this game I have in 10 plus already.

This is almost a hybrid of Mirrors Edge crossed with Mechwarrior doused with a  dash of Halo and sprinkled with Call of Duty.  It is a well thought out FPS game with adequately sized maps and overall is fun to play.  Overall a few days in and i am enjoying it, this franchise will go a long way.

My complaints and I have two of them.  I hate having to build up skills to get the build and guns  I want.  For the love of god give us everything at the start and let us build our own characters... My second complaint is a lack of a instruction manual, I miss the days of thick instruction manuals and back stories, does anyone remember the legend of Zelda manual, it was a history,  maps of all keys on the controller and what they do, fun tips and hints, maps, it was a well thought out manual to a well thought out game.

While I love CoD, I'm terrible at it.  This game has some truly new gameplay that puts many of today's shooters to shame.  And it's accessible to people of all skill levels.  Even if you're not a boss killer, you'll have fun with this game.  Being able to have your character scale walls and have maps with verticality is really something that other shooters don't have.  And the mechs (Titans) just make the whole experience new.  Some people prefer pilots (so they can transfer their CoD and BF skills) but I much rather control a Titan.  The action is always fast and there's constant chaos everywhere.

Now, I did play the beta extensively so I knew the strategies of the game somewhat.  However, I didn't get my copy of Titanfall right away so by the time I started playing the final retail version, many gamers out there had already leveled up significantly which put me at a significant disadvantage.  But now that I've leveled up somewhat, that disadvantage is slowly going away as I have unlocked more weapons and abilities (to match the abilities and weapons I had when in the beta).  You will likely get killed a lot until you can unlock the weapons.  But once you do, the game is amazing.

The game hasn't had a perfect launch (seems like most games these days need to get patched after release), but it's still surprisingly robust of a game of this caliber and it's already being patched quickly by Respawn (PC needed the update first).

Every generation, there are certain games that make you fall in love with a system.  Gears of War 2 was my first Xbox 360 game, and it was the game that got me to buy the 360.  Titanfall is the game that will make you want an Xbox One.",03-13-2014

This is the most bare bones shooter I have ever played. The maps are large so the Titans can have room to play, but they are too big for pilot on pilot combat. You spend half the match looking for a HUMAN to shoot until you and them get enough kills to call down a Titan. Then the map is filled with Titans and that is just plain boring then. I was hoping that this game would be great and live up to the hype, but it doesn't. MS must be paying the media and game reviewers off, because this game is just plain bad. I'd much rather play the broken, glitchy mess that is Battlefield 4 than this game. Don't believe the hype. It could have been good, but 6 vs 6 is just too small of a player count to make this game feel epic. And the graphics....you'll have to look twice to make sure you didn't hook your 360 up by mistake because these graphics are outdated and UGLY. Horrible textures, and an odd resolution of 792p....yes 792p keeps everything looking craptacular. But wait. The frame rate is no where near a solid 60fps.

I'm not huge on multiplayer games, but i really enjoy this. Its fun, has good graphics, awesome gameplay with some interesting new ideas. I don't think it's as ground breaking in the genre as some have said.

I rarely play the multiplayer component of games (CoD, Halo, Gears of War), so it is impossible to compete with people that are able to commit 4 to 6 hours a day memorizing the maps and basically dominate the game.  I bought the game fully aware that it was a multiplayer game only hoping the campaign would still be enjoyable.  It is not.  I don't enjoy playing a game that has me running around with no real purpose (except to capture areas, etc.) getting killed every minute.  So for anyone that enjoys the single player campaign experience and usually ignores competitive multiplayer, you will not enjoy this game.  The ""campaign"" has no story or exposition on why these two sides are fighting and it is just competitive multiplayer dressed up as a campaign.",03-12-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,1,Titanfail,"This is probably one of the worst games I've ever played for $60. As a standalone multiplayer game, it's worth maybe $15-$20 as an Xbox Arcade digital download. Though, it's not exactly $60 in my case. It was $249 because I bought the collector's edition. Suffice it to say that the CE-included humongous lighted statue and book combination are both far and away more impressive (and well worth the money) than the actual game. Let's begin with what's wrong.

Repetitive

Okay, okay. What game isn't repetitive? But, literally level after level after level is the same thing over and over and over. Other than the map changing, you're literally doing the same thing on each new level. There's no questing, no level ups, no strategy, no cover, no secrets, nothing to find.. I mean there is nothing. You're running around on a multiplayer map trying to avoid being constantly shot dead by the IMC (other live players). Titanfall is merely a death match wrapped around a weak semblence of a 'campaign' story.

So, the gist is that you either play as the Soldiers (blue) or IMC (red). The sole point is to win the level or be defeated. After one of the two outcomes, you get to the evacuation ship or you don't. You get points for being evacuated or you don't. The only and sole point is to run around killing anything you can find that is not someone on your team... and avoid being killed.

HUD

The HUD on this game just plain sucks. Unless you're close enough to actually be killed by another player, you can't tell if the player running around in the field is an enemy or a friendly. By the time you can get close enough to find out, your character is already being shot dead.

Controls

The movement is way way overly sensitive. Even on the least sensitive, you can literally spin in place with barely a tiny press of the stick. It's way way too sensitive even on the least sensitive threshold. So unrealistic.

Titans

About 2 minutes into each level, you can call for a Titan and it will fall from the sky. You can enter it and start your battle with your mech for as long as it survives (which is usually not longer than about 1-2 minutes). You then have to wait for another one to become ready (randomly between 60 seconds and never).

By the time you get your titan, all of the other players on the level are now in their titans. So, the playing field is leveled, kind of. Meaning, you can't exactly run around squashing other players by stomping on them. So, the point in being in a titan is really pointless by the time you actually get it.

Oh, and the animation to get into the Titan takes AGES to finish. It's like watching paint dry each time you enter a Titan.

Yes, the Titan armor is a clever gimmick. When playing the Titan portion of tutorial, I got the impression that you'd actually be able to use all of the clever things included. Like, jumping out of your Titan, opening doors and then calling your Titan through the doorway to get back into it. Nope. No need for that feature. At least, not in the first 5 level ups. I'm guessing if that's to become useful, it must be in a much later level. I have no intention in waiting through this poor excuse for an expensive game to get to a level where I can actually find out. I really don't have that much interest. If this game is actually about Titans, then let us use them more than not. There are far too many multiplayer ground combat simulators already. We don't need another. If you're going to offer us the use of a Titan mech, then offer the use of it to us all of the time.

Fun? No way

Every level starts and ends the same. The only thing different is the map. Everyone gets their titan at the same time. No fun to be had in that. Basically, every level ends up a free for all death match scenario with a really weak story premise behind it just to get the level going.

Worse, you can be playing the first level of the so-called 'Campaign' mode, but the game selects people who are level 42 and pairs them with people who are level 2. There's no fun in that either. If you're going to design a game where levels are important, then you should pair up people are within no more than 3-4 levels higher or lower than one another. Sorry, but this is single the biggest fail of Titanfail. When you design a multiplayer based game, you don't pair up players who are orders of magnitudes levels higher. That just doesn't work.

Definitely not enough Titan mech time. These things are far too fragile and explode when someone sneezes.

Overall

This game offers absolutely no single player campaign play. This is strictly a multiplayer game. Worse, this game is a weak multiplayer game wrapped in a pseudo-campaign mode that offers just enough of a premise to set itself up as a death match multiplayer game. Worse, there's nothing to do other than running around shooting everyone and everything in sight. There's no strategy, no questing, no dossiers, no audio files, no nothing to pick up around the level. Yes, it is eye candy, but that's it. If you really like just doing nothing but mindless death match and leveling up, there's nothing to see here.

Titanfall, by far, is the best multiplayer game out today!

After playing Titanfall, CoD & BF4 games I feel like they are lacking in gameplay--as I feel like I should be jumping on buildings.. or manning a mech.

CoD & BF4 skills definitely help when you're a pilot, but if the game play is unique where you also have to utilize the double-jumping, climbing buildings and jump on board with calling in mechs.

The statistics say that the majority of gamers playing COD Ghosts and Battlefield 4 are in multiplayer most of the time.. I can agree with that stat but with one exception here.... Ghosts and BF4 both have great multiplayer and a pretty good story campaign. Titanfall only has multiplayer and the price is the same!??? Am I missing something here? The future is moving to multiplayer yet the price is the same as games with multi and a story mode now??? Can anyone else see the problem here? We are paying more for less! We have just given the gaming industry a green light to produce multiplayer games alone for the same $60 price tag! Then to top it off they want us to buy a season pass for half of a game and charge us $25 more dollars just for maps? Really!?? If I am the only one that sees this as a problem we are all in trouble because we all fell for this rip off!

If this is the future of gaming where you get half of a game for full price, you will find me in the past! There is no way I nor anyone else could ever warrant giving this game a 5 or 10 rating! Its sad we now live in the age where there is a Titanfall multiplayer game for $60. Its just as sad that they are charging $30 for Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground Zeroes. Ground zeroes is basically a Demo of the real game that you have to pay $30 for!

Right now Im going to say Titanfall's less ""next gen""(bloody stupid buzzword) than say... Mario Kart 8. Which looks like Boxart CGI and runs at a clean clip of 60fps. (Titanfall dips because combat gets absolutely crazy in this game) You got 12 soldiers and 12 titans running amok all over the god damn place after all.

If I had to describe Titanfall I'd say its Call of Duty 4 with Mechs. Its really evolves the FPS genre by bringing a package that takes previously touched upon concepts in shooters and ties them all together in a nice well implemented package that is incredibly involving and fun. The game is so satisfying from a basic mechanics point of view. Its designed quite soundly. Graphically I'd say the game has some really impressive texture work, its really pretty makes everything look very distinct. I hope to see some updates later like a DLC single player mode,( Like a challenge fest) or destructible environments ( say on the Xbone, making use of its beefier CPU) to really add to the overall feel of the world and game, although I think that'll hurt the framerate even more. Probably why its sort of light on the graphical effects when it comes to explosions, but the texture work is damn good so you don't even care XD.

But Im going to say this, if there is one thing that TitanFall excels at, its speed. This game is really momentum based. You can move incredibly fast in this game, and that ups the ante and dynamic of gunplay a lot in this game. The dynamics of outsmarting your opponent and controlling the field are entirely different.

At one point or another I'd love to see an update where they add some destructible environments that you could jump off of and launch yourself into a Titan where you proceed to wreck the field left and right.

At the end of the day, if you're a Call of Duty fan, you're going to absolutely adore this game.

Which is perfect for the Xbox One. And your PC. And your Xbox 360.

If you like a different flavor to your shooters and something on less epic proportion, I recommend Steel Diver,or Deus Ex. Or Spec Ops:The Line :P

Moral of the Story: The funnest next gen game on the PSbore/Xbone, is not next gen at all. Be wise with your dollars! Buy good software!! Consoles are for games! Not Warfare. Or graphics. PC's do that much better. Its great building a rig and putting it in a living room. I can play Dota 2 right there! Or Mid-Budget indie games with a controller! But PC's are open platforms! So my games won't always support controllers! Drivers can be annoying but hey, tweaking is the joy of owning a PC. Lol. I think the SteamBox will be interesting because it makes the open source platforms slightly more standardized.

When it comes to consoles you gotta do two things well, creating amazing gameplay experiences that are fun to watch and even more fun to play, to explore in, from their mechanics to their world. Games like Bayonetta 2, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, Xenoblade Chronicles, Shin Megami Tensei. Those games. So focus on that. Leave everything else to the rabble. Because at the end of the day Titanfall is worth a hell of a lot more than Killzone Shadowfall will ever be.

I played TitanFall on a PC with Minimum settings(for Kicks) prior to this review. The Xbox One version looks ""slightly better"" than a 360 game I hear.

As for the game. Im just going to say that TitanFall is a very strong and solid core foundation for something more. Its the bones with the muscle.

So far, it's been great to play, the campaign really is just a series of multiplayer missions with a sort-of backstory, but trust me, you won't care.

The action is incredibly fast, and as long as you trust the AI that it will find you a fight, you can just follow the grunts off to the next battle if you find at least 5 seconds where you won't be jumping and wall-running your way to a better position, shooting at enemy pilots, grunts, and titans, or just staring blankly upward while your titan falls from the sky in front of you.

I know 'exactly' why they didn't want to have more players per match.  6v6 is just the right size to scale the right amount of robots and the timers on getting titans are short enough that you are guaranteed to get your titan at least once (usually 3 or more) per match.

Though it's impossible to really describe this game in text.  Go watch some gameplay videos.  You know how smooth those players look?  Dropping enemies like pills and dropping titans left and right?  That is actually just normal gameplay.  It's smooth, fast, and crazy fun.  It's even fun when you lose with the 'Epilogue' mode where the losing team tries to escape on a drop ship and the winning team tries to stop them.

The fact that the servers were/are down (more than a few hours. It was almost 11pm EST 3/11 when I still couldn't play) only accentuates this point.

What happens if/when the servers are taken down in 2-3 years? That means this game will be worthless. Unlike some on here I like to throw in a classic game on the Xbox or PS every once in a while. If I paid for a game I expect it to work regardless of servers. Need for Speed Hot Pursuit and some other games have gone this route instead of allowing co-op. I hate. Co-op should be in every racing game or first person shooter. So in the end it's almost an epic but without a campaign, or co op, this is more of a download only game like Killer Instinct. Good but not at the level of a Gears or Halo.

It is fun as a game can get, without being too frustrating (as Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty can be at time).

Owning an XBox One, I was obviously excited about the game since last year. However, I found the Xbox One version very disappointing in respect to visuals. Having done some research, I realized that the resolution of the final version of Titanfall for the  Xbox One was at 792p. Honestly, I've never heard of such a resolution, being used to 720p, 1080i or 1080p. I was really hoping that this game, for my next-generation Xbox One would ship at 1080p. By the same token, another key element to a video game is frame-rate, and unfortunately, the game also has short-comings in this department. It is a shame, simply because the game is very fun, and I would love to have the performance as well. I plan to purchase the PC version, since it is a vast improvement over the Xbox One version, but I'll wait for a price drop.

Overall, DO NOT buy an XBox One  ""just"" for this game, that's just a misuse of $400 which can be used  for other things. My advice to potential Xbox One buyers looking to get the console to play Titanfall, is to either get the PC version (like I should have done) since the specs requirements are very minimal OR to wait for the XBox 360 version (granted you own one). The Xbox 360 version will be 720p, which is not far from the Xbox One's 792p (specially for the $400+ difference).

This game is a great addition and a must-have for core and casual gamers.",03-12-2014

Matchmaking is also absurd since it appears to drop anyone to fill in the queues. A whole team of level 1s versus an entire team of level 20s? Yeah, that happened. On the campaign mode, you're stuck with your same team members until you finish or you/they leave the game.",03-12-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,Enough Reason to buy an Xbox One,"First Impression:
I was quite split when the new consoles were first released because of having a PS3 and 360 but know that my gamble has now paid off. Sure PS4 has better hardware but the Xbox one is not bad at all and has all the best exclusives like Titanfall, Halo, Gears of War and some other games like Plants vs Zombies, Sunset Overdrive, Quantum Break, Killer Instinct, Forza, Dead Rising, Ryse. Sadly Playstation has some good single player games but nothing new or any great multiplayer exclusives.

Pros:
1.) Graphics - Even though it is at only a native 792p that is upscaled to 1080p it still looks really good for not having any horrible latency issues like BF4. A later patch is supposed to upscale the game to 900p or native 1080p the developers said. About 95% of the time at 60 fps with some minor hiccups at very heavy action in titans but is said to be fixed soon.

2.) Gun mechanics and balancing - Seems like everything in the game is in there for a reason and there are plenty of choices to match your play style. The gameplay between Pilot vs Titan is very well balanced.

3.) Verticality and Mobility - This really makes this game so fun with the jet packs, wall running, wall hanging, double jumping and such.

4.) Unique - It has things like interactive AI and environmental changes like the flying monsters on Boneyard picking up some AI grunts and killing them. The jump kick and snapping peoples necks is really cool and funny.

5.) FUN FUN FUN - Most fun I have had in a FPS game in the last 4-5 years.

Cons:
1.) No single player campaign -  but I understand that Respawn is a small team and wanted to make the best experience possible on multiplayer. That said there is a campaign multiplayer which you play 9 rounds on both the IMC and Militia which kinda gives a story and does have really cool intros when starting the match.

2.) 6v6 - it seems very well balanced and action packed on the maps that it is on but would be nice if perhaps they came out with slightly bigger maps and a game mode that allowed like 10v10 or 12v12 in a DLC or something.

Conclusion:
This game is defiantly worth the $60 and is the stepping stone to a great generation with the Xbox One with having the best games around! Everyone with an Xbox should pick this up and if you are on the fence on what next-gen console the Xbox 1 cannot disappoint! Titanfall 2 may or may not come out on PS4. I'm guessing that Microsoft will keep making a partnership with Titanfall like they did with Gears of War but not own them like Halo.",03-12-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,Clash of the Titans,"There's been a sad trend in multiplayer FPSs lately. It seems that games like Call of Duty and Battlefield have taken a page from the Apple playbook and decided they could maximize profits by playing it safe and offering customers more of what they're used to with minor updates to provide incentive. That's not necessarily a terrible thing in every case (look at Madden for instance, same thing every year with a new coat of paint), but it is for the shooter genre which has infinitely more creative potential. That being said, Titanfall is a breath of fresh air for myself and many other fans of the genre. It's a bold new take in a market that's been stagnant for too long. And though it does have it's faults, it has more than enough strengths to tip the balance in it's favor.

I've decided to focus on the NEW features of the game for this review, since basically everyone is familiar with the core elements of an FPS (aim down sights, put bullets into things that aren't you until those things are dead).

[Titans]:
These 30 ft. tall mechs are the real stars of the show in this game and after playing it, it's easy to see why. The Titan gameplay is definitely a refreshing and somewhat relieving change of pace for an online multiplayer shooter. Some have wondered why the addition of Titans in an FPS is a ""gamechanger"" for the genre. Here are the 3 biggest reasons.

1). Durability
Playing as a Titan is in stark contrast to the COD/BF formula, where your soldier feels about as fragile as tissue paper against your opponents. In a Titan you no longer have to worry about ""campers"", ""spawnkilling"", ""noobtubers"", C4 or even lag! There are really no cheap deaths with Titans and everyone gets a fair chance to live for more than 10 seconds.

2). Survivability (is that a word?)
Titans are also different compared to vehicles in other games, like Battlefield, because Titans don't explode instantly when they're finished and they can also eject players. Basically that equates to being able to survive a vehicular destruction and continue playing on the same life. In most shooters with vehicles if the vehicle goes down, it's taking you with it. Or even if you manage to hop out at the last second, what are the chances that whatever destroyed your vehicle isn't going to blow you up as well? Thank you eject button!

3). Customization
Pretty self explanatory, but it's still a first. In BF or Halo you simply find stock versions of vehicles scattered around the map. Now you can tweak these walking tanks to your liking in a variety of different ways to suit your playing style.

[Bot Reinforcements]:
This is something that may need some tweaking to reach it's full potential. Bots, or ""grunts"" and ""spectres"" as they're called in-game, populate much of the battlefield in Titanfall. They do a surprisingly solid job at creating a full scale war illusion. It takes a humble 6 vs 6 scenario and turns it into a massive conflict. They definitely bring something to the table, but for the most part they behave like they haven't really decided what they're supposed to do with they're gun yet. At times you'll encounter them and they'll simply stare for a moment before shooting you with what must be a pellet gun, because it awkwardly takes it's time sweet time to kill you. They can be dangerous in groups, but that's pretty much it. It's bad enough to make you feel embarassed when one kills you. But it's still plenty of fun to take them down. Everyone loves a free kill, and these guys practicaly gift wrap it for you. Perhaps they deliberately went for the brain-dead behavior so little kids or your golden retriever can take pride in the fact that they made something dead.

[Multiplayer Campaign]:
This is where the game falls short the most, but since this is a multiplayer ONLY game, it's hard to really be too disappointed about it. Even after playing through the campaign with both factions, you'll most likely have no idea what the story was about. There's simply too much going on in-game to pay attention to the talking heads that pop up intermittently. If they wanted to present a story, they should have done it in cutscenes, not while a Pilot is riding your Titan like Seabiscuit trying send it to robot heaven.

[Burn Cards]:
Burn cards are little bonus perks that are one life use only. You get them frequently, but you can only use 3 per match. Truth be told, they just seem very unnecessary and slightly unbalance an otherwise pretty well balanced game. For example, some of these cards will straight up give you an enhanced version of a gun that does more damage. That doesn't quite feel like an even playing field, but there are probably many who would disagree. However, there are also cards like Double XP that feel perfectly fine. So it's obviously a mixed bag here.

[Jetpack]:
You can finally double jump in a FPS... and it's beautiful. No, but seriously, it makes getting around so much easier and it's a lot of fun. Don't know why this is the first FPS to do this, platformers have been doing this for decades.

[Parkour]:
Overall, the parkour elements of wall running and wall jumping are pretty hit or miss. It's not that these moves don't work, it's just that there are numerous times where it can feel a bit clumsy and imprecise, resulting in maneuvers that can only be described as a fail.

Pros:
+Titans
+Mentally Challenged Bots
+Jetpack/Double Jump
+Vehicle Customization

Cons: (All Very Minor)
-Story Campaign
-Burn Cards
-Occasionally Clumsy Parkour

Only get this if you want fast paced twitch style multiplayer only.  And, if that's what you want you can't do better than this game.  This is one of the best multiplayer games I've played in years!  Hands down the best of breed for 2014.  It's got a few new twists that keep it interesting.  Plus I found that gameplay was extremely well balanced for both new and old game styles and abilities.  I'm old game style, and can handle my own but carpal tunnel issues slow me down these days...  Yet I was still able to rack up plenty of kills and scores without much.  Of course I was rarely on top, but that didn't keep it from being fun and exciting.

That said, I'm not much of a twitch style gamer any more.  So I was sad to see this game was that and that only.  But I kept playing because it was so good in that aspect.  Also I was surprised to see zero single player gaming.  This is the games biggest mistake, and why I took away one star.  Other negatives were the pathetic ""training"" mode you are forced to go through.  Really guys?  I think we all know how to play FPS games these days.  Just throw us into the action and we'll figure it out!  Leave the training there for those wuses that need it but for us seasoned gamers it's annoying!

I guess I was expecting a little more, mostly in the visuals. Alot of gamers say this defines next gen. Don't know why. Is on 360 too, so how is it next gen? I will be very interested to see what this looks like on 360. I honestly see nothing that grabs me and makes me say wow, that looks amazing. It looks like a 360 game. I wish it had the visuals of something like BF4.  I do applaud Retro for introducing a new spin on FPS games. MAybe it was the overkill in all the hype that's left me somewhat disappointed. I do recommend the game for FPS fans. It's a fast and frantic game with a good amount of choices in loadouts for pilots and titans. It has a strong COD feel to it. For me that is a negative, as I have grown tired of the series, but the wall running and titans break that feel a little. XB1 has the better game library compared to the PS4 and this game is much better than Killzone. Brilliant move by MS to secure this as an exclusive for the xb1. Can't help but wonder how this would look on my PS4 though.",03-12-2014

There is no way I can see this game getting all the awards that were listed in the hoopla that was vomited by the media in support in this project.  Well, maybe they were the only game that was nominated, that would work.

I will say that the static graphics of the game are great, they are crisp, clear and very sharp, but other than that the graphics are a joke.  The NPCs look like they were drawn by a 5 year old, is that really the best that could have been done?

But who cares about graphics really, the real reason you pick up a game is to play it.  Then why have many of the advancements that have been made in game play just been forgotten?  We are back to a non-destructible environment with impenetrable walls, even COD realized that you can shoot through stuff.  They also realized that you don't stand straight up in a fire fight, really guys, the Okay Corral was a long long time ago.

Campaign
Wow, the campaign was at best short, you finish it win or lose, so why have it.  You can't play it on your own, which means that unless you have a team that is willing to play domination rather than run around and die, you will lose.

Attrition
This is nothing more than a slugfest, who can shoot first and fastest. There is no strategy, just force.

Oh well, this game will be cheered to the heights by those who love it, and I'm obviously in the minority opinion so I'll leave it at that.",03-12-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,"Perfectly Balanced, Inredibly Fun, Room for Expansion but No Gambreaking Issues","Score: 9.5 based on fun, mobility, balance, scope, but lack of modes.

 Titanfall is easily the most hyped-up game Ive ever picked up on day one.  The awards at E3, the fantastic beta with accolades raining down from 95% of the sources, stories of how this game would decide the Xbox Ones fate.  It was a maelstrom of blissful anticipation and angst.  And it was doomed to fail.  I mean, come on, hyped games always fall flat.  Its simply the nature of the beast: you cant live up to marketing.

 I am happy to say that in this case, for once, the hype storm has not wrecked the impression of the final product.  Titanfall truly shines as a shooter, albeit one that builds on current ideas rather than innovates into the future.  But before I get into the nitty-gritty details, one thing needs to be said: this game is unbelievably fun to play.  No really, it is shocking.  It has been a long while, back to Halo: Reach, since a FPS mechanics (rather than story or the thrill of unlocking things) made the game enjoyable, and that in and of itself is a huge feat in my book.  If you enjoy multiplayer FPS and want to skip the read and grab the game, you probably won't be dissapointed.  So, what makes this thing so fun?

1) Style/Graphics
 I need to start by saying that I am no videophile.  I cant tell the difference between upscaled 1080p and native 1080p, but I know many can.  If it matters to you, be aware that Titanfall runs native at 792p.  Yep: 792p.  Theres a weird one that doesnt come up very often.

 What I can attest to is that this game is beautiful.  Like, my wife will actually sit and watch me play for more than 30 seconds beautiful.  The maps are drab enough to look real, but there is definitely color enough to be found.  The design of the maps is impeccable, and this flows over into how they look architecturally.  I don't think any two maps are really similar at all.  Each has unique structures and different styles.

 The titans look awesome, and are different enough in their appearance so that you are able to recognize the specific type and morph your tactics based on what you are fighting.  The detail on the pilot and grunt design is nice enough out of the match; in-game, its good enough to not be noticeably good or bad (I never had a chance to look closer than that without dying).  Also, its nice Respawn used of the same color palette for the peeps and the world.  While I wouldnt recommend camping, character models blend in rather nicely to the environment to the point where moving slowly and hiding becomes a viable tactic once in a while.

 What makes this game really stand out graphically is the animations.  Moving, wallrunning, mantling, aiming, and (I think everyones favorite) getting grabbed midair by a giant robot and placed gently into its gut, all come off with beautiful fluidity.  Sometimes if you watch from a 3rd person perspective you notice some hiccups when a player works the system inelegantly (read: using the expanded parkour kit to do triple vertical wall jumps), but other than these oddities all the actions still seem very real.  The best compliment I can give is that watching a titan battle is a brutal ballet rather than two robots quasi-floating over the ground.  Yeah, the footwork is that good.

 Lest I forget, I need to give a shout out to the water.  I literally stopped dead still in a match when I jumped in a puddle and the stuff moved like, you know, water!

2) Story/Storytelling
 I doubt Im going to have time to finish the campaign before I want to post this.    That said, Ive heard that it is still total multiplayer with snippets of story.

3) Gameplay
 If you expected Titanfall to be anything less than gameplay-centric, you were kidding yourself.  Respawn didn't want to make the prettiest game, it didn't want to create a sweeping epic; it wanted to revolutionize the shooting genre.  And  Well, not quite.  The final product is more of a perfect polishing of current ideas rather than a complete revolution, but as a revitalization Titanfall truly shines.  If you want a rough take on the gameplay, think COD as a pilot, then Halo as a titan.  That really doesnt do it justice, however.  There are three things that really make gameplay stand out: mobility, balance, and size.

 It is strange that many FPS often underemphasize mobility.  Soldiers run daily for a reason, the cavalry was so important for a reason, the English navy wrested the seas from the Spanish for a reason: mobility is essential in combat.  Titanfall grabs this idea and shoves it to the forefront.  If you don't move in this game, you're dead.  If you don't exercise discretion in how you move, you're dead (I sometimes wonder why I am running through an open field where a giant robots sits, waiting to shoot at me).  If you don't embrace verticality, you're dead.  Even the Ogre, the biggest and slowest titan, has a short lived speed boost and moves at a good clip normally.  This newfound love of the battle of positioning is extremely refreshing.  Fortunately, the maps do not have clear stand here and win locations, forcing you to constantly evaluate where you are and who is near you.  More than anything else, Titanfalls speed and movement make it a blast to play.

 Balance is the next greatest feature of this game.  Everything in this game appears to balanced beautifully.  Smart pistol that locks on for insta-headshots?  Three second lock-on time for pilots.  Suppressor that hides your location on the minimap?  Noticeably less damage.  Giant robots that squish you as a pilot?  Innumerable hiding spots, powerful anti-titan weapons, and you get to hop on their heads and blow their robo-brains out.  Its a great feeling to not get completely owned in a map because the other team got the sniper rifle/tank/uber-death robot first.  The balance really emphasizes skill over tech, and who doesnt appreciate that?

 Lastly, the scope of each battle really stands out.  Yes, Titanfall is only 6v6, so how does this indicate the scope is impressive?  Two reasons: AI and titans.  The AI is cannon fodder to be sure, but in a beautifully distracting sort of way.  For one, you are constantly doing something: shooting them, snapping their necks, hacking the specters, wondering whether this human is on your side, etc.  As an extension of that, all the character models look roughly the same, meaning you never immediately know whether you're shooting at a pilot or a grunt.  And that, dear reader, is the point of uniforms.  Embrace it.  Back to scope, however, the AI grunts make you feel like you're actually in a war.  Not a battle between two elite units, an all-out war between two sides with grunts and heroes.  Its a neat fusion of competitive multiplayer and a horde mode.

 Second, titans are impressively massive as a pilot.  Anything other than 6v6 with titans would be infreakingsane, and not in a good way.  The maps are perfectly sculpted to make your dinky little pilot feel minute, leading to a feeling of emptiness at times.  But you fill these babies up with four, five, six titans per side and it gets real crowded, real fast.  As a pilot, trying to figure out a way to fight off 3 titans while your timer slowly ticks down really reinforces how miniscule you are.  Its a dichotomy not often realized in most games and really emphasizes how different the scope of the game is depending on who you are playing as.

 Outside of those three big features, there are a few pros relative to the gameplay that certainly deserve mentioning:

1) Tactically, the maps are incredible.  You have buildings, roofs, alleys, auto-turrets, hills, you name it.  On top of that, Respawn went out of their way to ensure the maps played to both titans and pilots, as well as the mobility of both.

2) I don't if this belongs, but its so shocking I have put it in.  I am not constantly staring at my minimap.  I don't know whether it is a function of better graphics or map placement or what, but without even thinking about it I am no longer spending the whole game looking at my map a la Halo.

3) The unlocks in this game are fun, especially burn cards.  I hate play-to-win multiplayer games.  Play-to-be-good for a few rounds is kind of neat, though, especially since you get bonus points for killing folks who use the burn cards.  Also, the weapons add variety without being overpowered.

4) The AI on the titans is surprisingly good.  They have a good grasp of when to block and when to shoot.  The dodging needs work, though.  Id love to see a tech-demo where the AI for titans and grunts is bumped up to the max.

5) The different modes are varied enough to keep them fresh and force you to switch up your playstyle.

6) The fact that there is no single player.  Gasp!  This is a pro?!?  What is this madness?  Come on, folks.  Do you really think Titanfall would be so balanced if there was a single player component?  Do you really think the maps would be as good?  Im a huge fan of single player games, but focus is not necessarily a bad thing.  This game still has enough content to be worth $60, and I am glad Respawn chose to focus on one part of the game to make it great.

 All this fanboy raving aside, there are some cons to the game:

1) Theres no single player.  Alright, fine, you win, I want more backstory to this awesome universe!  Standalone campaign, perhaps?

2) There are only five multiplayer modes: Attrition (every kill counts), Last Titan Standing (kill all enemy Titans, multi-round), Pilot Hunter (pilot kills count), CTF (with a side switch at halftime), and Hardpoint (multi-hill king of the hill style).  Now, as stated, these are actually quite varied in their playstyle to the point where each are fun and unique, but a free-for-all is definitely lacking.  An asymmetrical defend/attack mode would also be nice.  Hopefully these get bumped in a few weeks or so, but for now there are definitely some missing features.

3) Titanfall is locked at 6v6.  Okay, I know I applauded this in the section on scope, but it would be nice if they made a giant desert world playground for a 12v12 match.

4) Server issues.  Someday this won't be talked about.  HA!

 Titanfall has not met my ridiculously high expectations, but it is still an exceptional game.  It is surprisingly fun, fresh, and fast.  It didn't reinvent the wheel, but it does stick you in the driver seat of one hell of a ride.  All the pros of this game are vital (especially balance), while all the cons easily fixable with updates.  Definitely grab this game if you like FPS.  If you are a single player person, give it a try.  Titanfall is different enough that you might find yourself surprised.",03-12-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,The next great FPS,"Titanfall is all about fast paced action, fluid controls and stylish parkouring. It can easily be ridiculed for simply being ""Call of Duty with mech's"" because of its similar reload animations and weapon designs. Make no mistake that Titanfall is a totally different game in its own right. You can wall run, double jump, and sprint your way around each of the games 15 maps ranging from rich mountaintop bases to dilapidated cities and burned out beaches. Each map does a fantastic job of making you feel like it was once inhabited thus giving it substance and a hint of the games lore. 9 of these levels are especially well done since they take on a general theme even though the story never really seems to take off. This brings us to one of Titanfalls shortcomings: the Campaign Multiplayer. From the main menu, you are tasked with choosing one of three modes: Campaign Multiplayer, Classic Multiplayer and Training. The former assumes you in the role of the IMC and Militia(IMC must be played first) where you battle for supremacy and take down enemy players. The whole story seems like an afterthought, and I honestly couldn't tell you a single thing about it even after playing through the 9 Campaign maps as each faction. Luckily, the radio chatter can (and most likely will) be ignored throughout the missions and you will eventually forget it's even there so I wouldn't consider it distracting. My favorite aspect of the campaign came from experiencing different insertion points and pre-battle sequences. They really put you knee deep into the conflict, and it does a good job of getting your blood boiling before the bullets start flying.

Respawn left many gamers concerned when they announced Titanfall would only support 6 vs. 6 but I can assure you, each round is as hectic as if there were 24, or even 30 players running around at the same time. This is a double-edged sword though, because the majority of movement comes from infinitely generating AI grunts and spectres. After playing a handful of matches, I found that the presence of the AI often encouraged bad gameplay habits. For example, if you see an enemy running near a hard point objective, your instinct would be to take them out before they can capture it, but if it turns out to be an npc, you will often draw unwanted attention to yourself and give human enemies a free kill. To be fair, human-controlled pilots are clearly highlighted on your radar with a large, solid red dot, but often times they wouldn't show up on my minimap(not sure if it's a glitch or because they were cloaked). With every kill, my eyes would glance down to the bottom of the screen looking to see if my stylish takedown was against a human or a brain-dead npc running towards an objective(mostly the latter), and that's really discouraging, if not annoying. Some of my worst games occurred because I couldn't get a handle on where my enemies were, and despite my good aim and aggressiveness towards the AI soldiers, it only made me look like I did absolutely nothing for the team.

At the start of each match, everyone has a countdown timer indicating when they are able to drop their titan in the battlefield. Killing human pilots as well as the AI grunts shaves seconds away from your timer which allows you to drop your titan faster. This creates an interesting strategy that forces you to net points to get your armored beast summoned as quickly as possible. Titan combat is just as fluid as being a pilot, despite the main difference of dashing rather than jumping to be your main method of evasion. The three titan types, (or chassis) all have their own separate stats which leaves it up to the player to decide which one is right for each situation. One is slow and powerful, another has less health but moves faster, etc.

There's such an amazing balance between the coexistence of pilots and titans. Running and gunning only gets you so far, and you need to play it smart, especially if the other team is working together. Each battle in Titanfall essentially plays out the same, and it's disappointing to note the gametypes aren't exactly innovative for a game trying to set itself apart from the norm. Team deathmatch and capture the flag are a standard affair, while hard point domination essentially is a capture and hold (like Call of Duty's Domination game type). Pilot vs. Pilot and Last Titan Standing aren't all that interesting either, since the core aspect of the game centers around the combination of running and gunning as a pilot while titans wreak havoc on their own accord. One cool feature is the addition of burn cards, which are essentially buffs that apply to a single life that can be chosen before each match. You can hold up to three per game, and they can range from an upgraded weapon to faster movement. It gives you an added sense of strategy when deciding on which cards to take with you between matches.
Each location in Titanfall has its own visual flair, and there are tons of subtle touches that allow you to essentially get around the entire map without ever touching the ground. This takes practice though, and understanding the ups and downs of each map is essential to gaining any advantage on your foes. Titanfall isn't a perfect game though, and like the beta, it suffers from a lower resolution (792p) and various performance problems. Although the art style for this game is often really nice to look at, this is not what you would expect out of a next generation game. During play, you will notice frequent screen tearing and frame rate dips when things get hectic, and that hurts considering this is already a conservatively optimized game. The Pilot and Titan customizations leave a lot to be desired as well. First of all, it's weird that you can't rename your loadouts or alter the look of your soldier (other than changing your gender). Equipping different weapons comes with a pre-set character model so it's not like the different outfits don't exist, it just sucks you are forced to look a certain way depending on what weapon you choose. The unlockable weapons are mostly bland and uninteresting (even though they all carry a nice oomph to them and are fun to use) and there are far too few perks. As far as connection, I am happy to announce that I experienced little to no lag when running through a broadband connection (15mbps).

Verdict: This game doesn't redefine first person shooters, but if you are looking for a breath of fresh air for the annual releases of Call of Duty and Battlefield, then Titanfall is a more than worthy competitor. Sure, It has technical problems, a pointless backstory and npc's that may get you killed here and there, but it's all fleshed out to create a fantastic multiplayer game that can be summed up with addictive gameplay, a fleshed out progression system, amazing control and awesome level design.

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,Good game but I expected more,"First off, I like the game, I really do.  But for a game with no single player, this game should have a lot more multiplayer features.  Not to mention it should have more titans and more customization of said pilot/titan.

15 maps is good for a game that has a single player campaign element.  But yesterday I found myself playing the same maps a lot.  We should have gotten 20-25 maps since this is all the game is.  Not a big fan of that aspect.  I know DLC will address a lot of the issues I have, but some should have been addressed prior to launch.

You should be able to customize your Titan and Pilot with different skins, colors,  armor, helmets, something......but there really isn't any of these features included in the game.  Again, a multiplayer only game should have a ton of extras like this.  Also more weapons and perks would have helped make the classes more your own.

There are not very many game modes.  I like the variety pack option, but it is very limited as to what they offer.

Again I like the game a lot, but for $60 bucks I guess I was just expecting more.  I mean really the game is just the beta with more maps.  I was expecting them to be holding something back to reveal to us when the actual game shipped.  Sadly there wasn't much more to it than maps.

Also I wanted like 6-8 different types of Titans at least at launch.  3 doesn't really allow for much differentiation between players.",03-12-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,Fun fast paced shooter.,I'm not really a fan of COD and fast paced shooters. Battlefield is my favorite. As of right now I've bought the xbox one for titanfall and the game hasn't let me down. A fast shooter that I enjoy and even though people compare it to COD I don't see it that much. With jet packs and wall running it seems like a completely different game. Really enjoy it. Will always go back to battlefield but this is a great change of pace.,03-12-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,The most fun I've had with an FPS in ages!!,"I used to be a huge fan of shooters, however over the past few years I'd lost interest.  When I first heard about Titanfall I was hopeful, but remained cautious.  When I got to play the Beta a few weeks back my hopes were lifted.  Now after several hours of playtime I've got to say this game is certainly worth the hype.  I've not enjoyed myself this much playing a shooter in years.  Even matches that don't go my way, or matches that I downright suck at I still find myself having a blast.

The game is very fast paced.  At no time do I find myself wishing there were more players in the match.  6vs6 is the perfect balance for this game, and I'm sure most anyone who has actually played the game would agree.  Sure the bots aren't very intelligent, but it still feels great to wipe them out.  The graphics are great, I could care less about the whole resolution thing, bottom line is that for a fast paced shooter it looks amazing.  In the end the most important thing for any game is the fun factor and this game is downright FUN!  I highly recomend it to any gamer, shooter fan or not.

***Update***  So I've had the game about a month now and thought I'd give a quick update.  While I'm still playing and still for the most part having a lot of fun I felt I needed to drop my 5 star score down to 4.  The main reason being that the Matchmaking system leaves a lot to be desired.  They recently did an update to it, that they claimed would improve it, but I'm not seeing it.  Its not game breaking bad or anything, but it could definately be improved a great deal.",03-12-2014

Hands down the best game out right now.",03-12-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,2,Almost an epic.,"The game fails because it has no campaign mode. I was willing to accept it as is and reluctantly purchased. Then I popped it in on launch day and I was reminded why I hate games centered around multiplayer. The fact that the servers were/are down (more than a few hours. It was almost 11pm EST 3/11 when I still couldn't play) only accentuates this point.

What happens if/when the servers are taken down in 2-3 years? That means this game will be worthless. Unlike some on here I like to throw in a classic game on the Xbox or PS every once in a while. If i paid for a game I expect it to work regardless of servers. Need for Speed Hot Pursuit and some other games have gone this route instead of allowing co-op. I hate this approach.  Co-op should be in every racing game or first person shooter. So in the end it's almost an epic but without a campaign, or co op,  this is more of a download only game like Killer Instinct.  Good but not at the level of a Gears or Halo...or is it worth more than a $40 purchase.",03-12-2014

Great game play, great graphics, 12 player co-op campaign and just all around greatness...

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,FPS shooter for the hardcore and casual player,"I'll be the first to admit, I am extremely competitive. So when playing any game, I play fairly serious. For the hardcore gamer, you can definitely have a challenge on your hands battling other players. But if your more of a casual gamer or not very good, the game has AI bots walking around for easy kills, so at least you can still feel like your helping your team out. So often games like COD, BF, and Halo, inexperienced or casual gamers cannot enjoy playing online. Constantly getting killed by those better than you or having unlocked everything, it's not fun or fair. At least with the AI bots, casual gamers can enjoy playing online and getting kills. Yet hardcore players can fight other players or find a game type that more suits them.

As for the gameplay, it's fantastic. It's frantic, fast paced, and action packed. A lot of items to unlock and different abilities keep the fun coming. 15 maps is also welcome as it never feels like you've played the same map 50 times in a half hour. Being able to free-run on walls and go wherever you want is really nice. Being a pilot up against a titan, you never feel like you have no chance. You can jump on the titan, rip their access panel off, and shoot their core. Anti-titan weapons can do some damage as well. Everyone gets a titan which is nice. The more kills you get the faster you can deploy one. Titans are so much fun to play as since they offer different play styles and layouts.

All in all, I've been waiting for a game like this for a while. If you like FPS, multiplayer, and the ability to free-run and jump into a giant robot and wreck havoc, do not hesitate and buy this. The only mistake you've made is not buying it sooner.",03-12-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,Good game that has quickly grown on me.,"I've been waiting for this game since Jason West and Vince Zampella left Infinity Ward a few years ago.  For those who don't pay attention to movements within the industry, this pair built the Call of Duty franchise (which has waned in their departure).  They hopped the fence and signed on with EA, and everything they've named since seems like a jab at Activision and the Call of Duty franchise.  ""Titanfall.""  ""Respawn.""  Like most gamers I had high hopes for this game and my take on it so far has been a mixed bag.  I will break it down into my initial impressions, since it just came out today.

The graphics are pretty good, but definitely don't scream ""next-gen.""  It's clear this was cross-generation development, and I'm feeling more strongly that we aren't going to get a true 'AAA' title built solely for a next-gen console in 2014.  The graphics are fairly detailed, but on-screen clutter causes things to blend together, namely campers and the background they are hiding in front of.

The campaign:  there is one, but it is integrated into online play.  Honestly, it could have been completely omitted and I wouldn't have noticed.  As it is, you have some guy yelling at you to do things that you would be doing anyway in an online shooter...  ""Capture this objective so I can see the computer.""  Sure, guy.  Whatever you say.  I have no idea what is happening with the story and couldn't care less.

Music:  In the background during the menus.  As I write this I can't remember anything about it, so I guess it does a good job of staying in the background.

Gameplay:  Fast and fun.  On day one people are already doing some pretty advanced stuff with the controls.  The game allows you to wall run, double jump, and wall hop.  It seems inspired by ""Mirror's Edge"" or more directly by parkour.  You can also cloak, which means finding people and effectively fighting them is difficult and quickly turns into a scramble.  I could see people becoming ninjas in a game like this, becoming virtually unstoppable just by how they move.  Once you get into your ""Titan,"" you slow way down.  It's almost a detriment to use the darn thing.

Bots:  Not sure why they are in a next-gen game.  They are distracting when you are trying to fight the actual players on the opposing team.  They get in the way, but I guess it's to make up for the 6-player teams, which is also baffling.  This game doesn't seem to be pushing the hardware and BF4 runs just fine with 64 players.

EA being cheap:  I know, I know, EA hasn't put instruction booklets in their games for a couple of years now.  I'm old-school, though, and this game would have benefited from a manual.

Overview:  The game reminds me a lot of ""Lost Planet"" for the 360 and PS3.  Not just the mech bit, though, I feel that the gameplay is going to cater to a very niche crowd and will have a tough time catching on with the mainstream.  Those who get good at this game will get extremely good, which will turn-off/frustrate newcomers.  Those who become really good at it will defend it as the greatest game ever, because Titanfall does give you the pieces necessary to develop skills that other players will struggle to match.  As it stands, at this early state, I would recommend it to core gamers that are willing to invest the time to get good at it.  If you are a casual gamer looking to just check it out, rent first.  You might be disappointed.

*EDIT*  Today is day three of Titanfall and I will admit that it has grown on me quite a bit.  The pace of the game makes it a lot of fun and I have gotten decent with the controls fairly quickly.  The game does a great job of keeping you interested in it, there are a ton of challenges and unlocks to keep you playing.  I've also gotten used to fighting in the Titans and have figured out how to use them effectively.  I added a star to my original score primarily for the fun factor.",03-11-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,4,"Fun, but maybe a bit overhyped. (EDIT: really started to enjoy it after a month)","I bought the Xbox One bundle that came with the digital download of Titanfall. I do find the game somewhat enjoyable, but I guess I expected more because of all the hype it was getting. Anyone that says it's just a COD clone with mechs is clueless. There is a lot more to grasp in this game than there is in COD. It takes time to get used to it, and learn the controls. Right now I'm not loving it, but not hating it either. It's definitely not your ordinary first person shooter. I played a few matches randomly during the day, and didn't experience a single issue, so don't listen to the negative reviews talking about how it's ""unplayable"" or whatever they're saying. I can't say anything bad about the game really. Who knows... Maybe ill start to enjoy it even more once I get more time into it.

EDIT: So after a month I started to enjoy it more. Understanding the mini map helped a lot. You need to know the difference between Pilots, Titans, and Minions on your radar. I regenerated once (which is nothing compared to some of the other day 1 adopters)and what I'm liking now is this isn't exactly like prestiging in COD. You get an XP multiplier for each generation which makes you earn XP slightly faster. You also have a list of challenges that need to get done before you can regenerate again. So basically, if you want to keep regenerating you CAN'T keep using your favorite weapons. This was a breath of fresh air for me because I enjoy using ALL of the guns in the game, and I like challenges... It also keeps people from using the best guns ALL the time. This gives Titanfall more replay value for me. I've learned to really enjoy it... So after a month I'm bumping my 3 start review up to a 4 star. If you're an XB1 owner and enjoy multiplayer shooters this is a must buy! You just have to give it a chance!",03-11-2014

Now that I have played all day on the final release with all that maps, all I can think is ""this is the most fun I have had with any game in a long time"".  This game is just pure genius.  It allows for many players with many different play styles to come together and have a great time.  Truly something to behold.  The maps are beautifully designed.  The movement and speed of gameplay is just incredibly addicting!  You never want to stop playing!

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,5,A refreshing boost to the FPS genre,"As a long-time first person shooter player, I had started to get bored of the games I once sunk hours into. Even the Halo franchise, which I have enjoyed for a long time, gets less and less play time, and I have spent more time in other genres. To put it plainly, the shooter genre just got stale. Nothing really new or compelling had come out in a long time, and the existing mechanics weren't enough to keep me around.

This changed with Titanfall. If nothing else, the movement of the game is enough to keep it from feeling like any other FPS out there. Jumping through second story windows, running on walls, and hopping from rooftop to rooftop just makes it feel different than any other FPS out there. The myriad ways you can traverse a map means that even if you have a general direction you like to travel on a given map, you have myriad ways of arriving there.

Throw the Titans into the mix, and this where things start to get really interesting. It essentially adds another game into Titanfall because the mechanics between being on foot and being in a Titan are so different. Where being on foot allows you visceral, fast movement and freedom, the Titans are a little more restrictive. You can only go certain places on the map, you are a hug target to any enemies on the map, and you need to think more about cover because being in a few-meter tall mech makes it harder to dodge fire. However, mastering the different Titans (there are three) and their various loadouts to give you the perfect combination for a given situation is very rewarding.

Speaking of rewards, although the game is short on story (the campaign mode is 9 missions that can be played from the viewpoint of each of the 2 factions), the various weapon rewards will keep you coming back for more. Whether it's getting the new scope for your carbine or unlocking the rapid fire mod for the Titan rocket launcher, there are some compelling upgrades that you're going to want to nab.

I've been having a blast with this game (more than any other shooter I have played in the past couple years), and suspect I will be for quite some time. Hats off to Respawn for breathing some new life into a genre that had otherwise begun to become very stale indeed.",03-11-2014

I didn't experience any issues in the time I played it. In all fairness, it's not a crappy game like some of the 1 stars say, but it's nothing earth shattering, like the 5 stars say. Have you ever played Quake or Unreal Tournament? Imagine it with mechs, and you've been here before. If it HAD had a really awesome single-player component, it might have been more interesting. There's a lot of fanboy fervor surrounding this game. I love the original Infinity Ward boys as much as anyone, and this is a quality game, but it didn't hold my interest for very long. Back to (buggy) Battlefield I guess.",03-11-2014
https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,3,"Fun game, but does it live up to the hype?","Titanfall is a fun multiplayer game.  But it lacks substance and can get boring fairly quickly in my opinion.  It doesn't take long to level up to max... it can be done in 3-5 sittings.  And it completely lacks a single player campaign.  It's basically a multiplayer only Call of Duty with robots.  If that's down your alley then this game is for you.  But personally, I have a hard time recommending it at full retail price.

Visually it doesn't look very impressive, and the framerate can be choppy at times.  After 15 hours or so of playing, I have experienced the framerate dropping significantly where it was an unplayable slideshow, but fortunately these moments were rare.  I'm going to chalk that up to being a bug.  A few reviewers have mentioned this as well (giantbomb), so apparently I'm not alone.  I have also played the PC version and it doesn't seem to have these sort of bugs.  Visually and performance wise, the PC is the way to go if you have a capable machine.

So does Titanfall live up to the hype?  My thought is, that would be impossible.  This game was built up to be a game changer, and it doesn't do all that much to differentiate itself from other shooters like Call of Duty.

So would I recommend it?  I would say if you spent countless hours on Call of Duty multi-player, then you'll probably be able to do the same here, and therefore it's probably worth the full price.  Otherwise I say wait for a price drop.",03-11-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,2,"Very good game, but not enough","I'm going to take a little different approach on this review. I see a lot of reviews getting slammed because they were expecting a single-player or cooperative campaign, and didn't read the fine print. I, on the other hand, knew that going in and I'm saying that what they released isn't nearly enough to warrant a five star review.

The game is fantastic, don't get me wrong. Resolution and graphics are solid, gameplay is smooth, frantic and fast paced. In short, it is a wonderful multiplayer experience--but so are plenty of other games. There is a lot you'll be familiar with here if you are a fan of multiplayer games. You have a character--you play and get kills--you get to level up and thus, get new stuff. Nothing new there. Now in this case, you have your mech, and depending on how you use him, he is either a vehicle (If you are inside) or an AI controlled squaddie (If he's following you around.) Is that new? Maybe, I mean who doesn't like having a 20 foot tall mech at his back. But revolutionary, absolutely not. There were articles out there saying this was the ""first true next gen title."" I don't see it. It's good. It's solid, and it's a great multiplayer experience, but the lack of a cooperative or single player experience makes me feel like they released half a game. It would certainly be worth $40, but $60 is a little steep.

They tried to weave a story into the multiplayer experience, but there's nothing there that is going to leave you feeling overly satisfied, or at least it hasn't with me.

This is a great multiplayer game. But a great multiplayer game, by itself, is not worth $60. I knew that going in and I bought it anyway. I make a good living and don't care about spending an extra $60 to play with my friends, but a lot of people don't have that luxury. And if you're like me, you expect more out of ""Next Gen"" games--not less. And this game just shows the disappointing trend of continuing to cater to the multiplayer crowd and neglect everyone else. Sad, but true.

EDIT*** I'm surprised at how few people are willing to throw their money into a game that is so lacking. I wanted to add a little to my review to give it more context. Titanfall is a shooter. Here is how you build a five star shooter, folks. I'll use one of my favorites as an example. Gears of War 3. A fantastic campaign, competitive multiplayer with far more options than Titanfall offers. Still not enough? No problem, then you can play cooperative multiplayer with your friends against bots, for those times when you aren't in the mood for playing with a bunch of bratty twelve year olds. Still not enough? No problem! Hop over and play the fantastic Horde Mode for even more fun. THAT is a fully fledged shooter worth $60. In fact, after having the discussions, I think I will probably end up knocking Titanfall down to two stars. When you have a company try to sell a game like this for the same price as a shooter that offers much, much more, Titanfall really shows its lack of polish. As a gamer and consumer, it should be insulting. As consumers we vote with our dollars. And every copy of this game that sells is a vote that says--We as consumers accept games that lack features. I say think hard before you do that.",03-11-2014

exploding bodies
jet packing
beautiful and unique weapons
Titans
cloaking etc,

Reasons you might not want to buy it:

Story is forgettable it's just team deathmatch and domination with cinematic parts inside of them

The graphics they are just decent not high end but only gameplay matters when it comes to a game
like this *Trust me*.

But if you wanna miss out on getting the best game on your xbox one hey be my guest :)
I wouldn't wanna be you.

But overall solid game to play with friends and strangers maybe you can make some friends on xbox live and every time you go into a different match it's a different experience you go from getting crushed by a running Titan or letting your Titan land on an enemy from above haha great stuff.

MUST BUY!!!!!!!
and oh yeah don't let those sony fan boys in the reviews fool you into not buying this wonderful game.

Even the campaign mode on this game is strictly multiplayer, no option for solo play.  To make it worse, After numerous attempts I have yet to find enough people in the lobby to even play the campaign mode.  The multiplayer is pretty good, don't think its as ""spectacular"" as some reviews say though.

If you solely enjoy online multiplayer its a good buy, for me and those like me who don't always want to deal with online players all the time however, its disappointing.  This fact should have been better publicized before the release for those of us who preordered.",03-11-2014

I only have about 3 hours in so far, so I may have to change the score later.  Server stability seems good, a few lag spikes/FPS drops here and there; but overall it has been a very smooth launch.

If you enjoy the fast, frenetic pace of CoD multiplayer then you'll feel right at home as the pilot.  In addition to watching your corners, make sure to watch up and down as this game is by far the best implementation of vertical combat I've ever seen.

Titan combat slows things down about 2 notches. Obviously, you move slower, but even the Ogre (heavy Titan) doesn't feel plodding. But the number of different tools at your Titan's disposal makes the Titan combat far more about strategy than quick reaction time.

Pilot vs Titan combat is balanced, but definitely favors the Titan (as it should).  Pilots can ping Titans relatively safely from a distance with their weapons (I would like to see the grenade launcher's damage toned down) or cloak yourself, sneak up on a Titan and ride the bull (called rodeo).",03-11-2014

The movement is fluid, the action is fast paced and there are quite a few new ideas that have been flawlessly implemented.  I'll undoubtedly get a lot of flack for offering a critical review, but reviews shouldn't be clouded by blind fanboy allegiances or posturing, so below you will find the aspects of the game that are less than stellar.

No Single Player component.  This is not necessarily a negative, depending on what your expectations are, but it is worth noting.

Graphics aren't spectacular, but the game is still quite good looking.

Limited number of play modes, though Attrition is fantastic.  Other than attrition, it's pretty standard FPS fare as far as the modes go.

Extremely limited matchmaking (which is disappointing considering Halo 2 made set the standard a decade ago).

That being said, the game is fantastic.  If you don't already own an Xbox One, it may not be worth buying a new console for (especially if you have a PC newer than five years old).  Everyone should play this game though.  The inevitable sequel should address all of the shortcomings of this title.",03-11-2014

Then (depending on the quality of yourself and your fellow gamers) it starts to rain, not water, not blood, but red-hot steel comprised death mechs! Then the game changes completely, where once you were jumping, hopping, and scaling, around the gorgeous, crazy-active maps, now you are a lumbering mech, with the intent to deal as much damage as mechily-possible before you turn that ride of yours, into a mini super-nova. Burn Cards, Campaigned-layer MP, Crazy cool weapons and strategies, and gorgeous visuals....this is what gaming is all-about, this is gaming!

-Based on the few hours I've played so far.

First things first- the mobility in this game is beyond fluid and so accessible.  To practically anyone.  Even if you're not a fan of shooters, you'll fit right in to this game.

Second, tons of customization and perks, unlockables, etc.
There are 3 titans and my god, they will become your best friends on the battlefield.

Third, pretty much everything is super balanced in this game- something that is no easy feat to accomplish.  I'm stunned by how stable and fluid this game is.

Fourth, 15 maps!!  15 freaking maps at launch = awesome news for a mp shooter.  Most shooter nowadays launch with very few maps, but these 15 maps come in quantity and quality (balanced with thoughtful design).

Fifth, if you dig call of duty or battlefield, you'll grow to like this game as the mobility will take you out of your comfort spot (which is a great thing)...

I'm not an avid shooter by any means but when I play this game I just love the feel, the ebb and flow of combat. I mean I may not get top leader boards regarding K/D but the moments in this game when you get a kill are very rewarding. So if there is anyone out there who may be in the same boat, you should pick this game up.

https://www.amazon.com/Titanfall-Xbox-One/dp/B00DB9JYFY?th=1,10,Video Games,Titanfall - Xbox One,4,2,I give a straight up 2.5.,"I have something called freedom of choice, and speech. I did not like the game therefore I am rightly entitled to MY opinion on it. I bought the bundled package yesterday, wanted to really play the game. So after downloading it and playing for about 2 hours, the servers go down. And still are not 100% up today. I find this unacceptable. The graphics are ok, crisp, clear, but with some jagged edges and blurs that harken back to last generation consoles. I have noticed all the 1 star reviews have been deleted by Amazon, in order to boost sales, and not let good old Microsoft down. Well guess what? Tough %%%%!!

The game has it's fun moments, wall running, jumping with the jetpack in the air to take down a titan or soldier is great fun. But after a while you think wow I payed 60 dollars, or got the console JUST for this. Which I was ready to purchase Forza 5 and Dead rising as well. Well suffice to say I won't be purchasing anything from them. I took back the system, period. Especially when the servers went down, and the excuses started.

Also having 6 vs 6 is not that much fun, people are easy to hunt down, I want more challenge, free for all, a single player campaign that doesn't require the net. In case it goes down (again). So this game is/was overhyped, but I think the true gamers know there are a lot better games with much better substance out there. I've never in my life seen something like this, just to boost sales, and popularity for a product. Take it down as much as you want, I'll just keep posting it back.

Pros
Accurate controls, unless your in the air, then it's tough
The learning curve is pretty easy, but not overly so.
The Titans are loads of fun, especially to pull out the pilot of your rival, and toss him away.
Environments are rich.
Very fast paced, so if you have epilepsy, best play something slower.

Cons
Server keeps crashing, even today.
Graphics are ok, barely looks next gen.
Frame rates can drop dramatically, making it very hard to play. (I have a 50mb connection with boosts to 70mb) btw.
Overall it's just another innovative shooter that has been glorified because of poor console sales. Period.

This is an authentic, to the point, review and opinion of the game. If it gets taken down, you'll know I was right. Thanks.

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,4,"The ultimate Halo single-player campaign omnibus, online MP is catching up (check most recent update)","Hey Folks. Just wanted to point out a couple very important things real quick about the collection and this review.

First, I personally love TMCC. I love it because it was the single-player campaigns that drew me to the series in the first place, and it is still what gets me most excited about upcoming releases. I love Halo's story, its characters, its writing, its pacing, its presentation, etc immensely. Very few gaming series delivers the incredible feeling of adventure, mystery, and discovery the way Halo does. I love it so much that I've devoured most of the extended fiction as well. If you are predominantly a fan of single-player Halo as I have always been, then TMCC is a wonderful product that is and has always been definitely worth purchasing. That is something I have not and will not budge in with regards to TMCC. I have never experienced any problems whatsoever with TMCC's SP content. Whether it's the stellar Anniversary editions of Halo 1 and 2, or the upgraded 1080p/60 fps Halo 3 and 4 campaigns (with Halo 3: ODST {I believe that stands for ""Omnipotent Deities Serenade Turkeys""} soon to join them), the collection has been a dream come true for me. Everything plays smooth and runs like a dream, looks better than ever before, and the fact it's all in one convenient place like this is fantastic. You easily get your money's worth just with the single-player content alone. That's my opinion anyway.

HOWEVER, that leads to my second point. The collection's myriads of unfortunate, inexcusable online MP problems are well-known by now. A lot of them have been ironed out, sure, but I implore you to read the  reasonable reviews on here that are critical (key word being ""reasonable,"" and they are rare, trust me). That's the beauty of Amazon: their review system will expose you to differing views from people with their own perspective and backgrounds. For me, I approach Halo with a single-player first priority, but it's good to get a well-rounded perspective from people who view it from the MP angle, and there are plenty on here worthy of consideration. The top review on the collection is pretty good in that regard, if a little harsh in my personal opinion. Still, it's always good to get other perspectives. That will help you make sure your hard earned money isn't wasted.

Lastly, this review is ridiculously long. Honestly, it was super long on its own, but given the bizarre and unusual circumstances surrounding The Master Chief Collection and its launch period it has become WAY longer because of all the updates I've had to write about it. I've labeled my review so you can easily skip all these and go straight to the original review at your convenience. Sorry for the length, but again, because TMCC is so unusual, it feels like you'd get an incomplete picture of this release if I just deleted all but one update. So there you go. Hope that clears things up and you enjoy this review. Have a wonderful day. Toodles.

*Update 6/22/15: There have been many new additions to TMCC since I last updated this review. First (and best) of all, Halo 3: ODST is now available for download. If you played the game before 12/19/15, you get to download it for free. If not, it's only $5. Yes, five bucks for one of the most inspired, unique, and interesting Halo campaigns ever made. Seriously ODST is a superb little game with an amazing sci fi noir mood, a great cast of characters (Nathan Fillion's Buck is returning in Halo 5!!!), a really unique story, and a soundtrack tied with Halo 3 as the very best in the series. It's very much worth $5 if you ask me. They also added in Spartan Ops from Halo 4 finally, but there is no matchmaking for those missions. You either have to play solo or with friends. They also added ""Remant,"" a Halo 2 Anniversary remake ofthe classic Halo 2 map ""Relic"" to matchmaking. It is free to all. Last night I played several different playlists online and had a great time. Matchmaking works really well for the most part, with very little-to-no connection issues. There seem to be new playlists added from time to time, and a ranking system is being added to others. All-in-all, very nice. The ONLY problem with matchmaking in TMCC now is low population of players. Many of the people who quit long ago when the collection wasn't working well seemingly have not returned (probably too busy yelling at 343 and using stupidly vague, confusing hashtags, I kid I kid). Overall, TMCC is a pretty fantastic package at this point. 4-stars.

*Update 1/28/14: Well, here we are, a few months after release day and TMCC works very well now. It's just too bad it had to take months to get this game up to a level where it should have been at release. 343 are constantly releasing updates and patches that makes the online component work better in various, incremental ways. Overall, TMCC is worthy of a purchase now, but I don't think it's worthy of anything higher than 3-stars, just because of the principle of it all. The biggest upcoming patch is actually going to be offered to select Xbox Live members as a BETA to test it out before it's released to public. I'll let that sink in for a moment... Yes, 343 are literally holding BETAS for CONTENT UPDATES for TMCC, TWO MONTHS after its release date. Wow. You cannot make this stuff up. I understand that 343 originally wanted to just make Halo 2 Anniversary and Microsoft essentially forced them to take up the mammoth task of making this a collection of Halo 1-4, with each game getting their own various updates. To do this, 343 essentially had to contract out each component of the collection to other companies, with Saber Interactive making H2A, Certain Affinity handling the MP and H2A MP updates, Ruffian Games handling the collection's ports Halo 3 and 4, etc. 343 DID work on the online networking and interfaces, however. Evidently they did test the online components prior to launch, but weren't prepared for the huge load on their servers after release day and ended up having to rebuild them from scratch. This is all very unfortunate and, for me at least, it's easy to feel bad for 343 given the circumstances. It was extremely unlikely that a release of this scope wouldn't release with significant problems, and as it turns out, it did. I don't think 343 are the evil harbingers of Halo's doom the way so many people rush to accuse them of being. The Halo 5 beta proved to me that they're passionate about the series, listen intensely to fan feedback, and want nothing but to give Halo the hyperbolic treatment a legendary series like this deserves. Weirdly enough, I'm more confident in Halo 5 than I've ever been after the beta. Still, this does not excuse the terrible launch of TMCC, a release that should have been legendary unto itself and one that could have cemented people's confidence in 343's stewardship of the series. Sadly, that's not what happened. It just makes me sad. So yeah, TMCC is quite good overall now. It's probably 4-stars good objectively speaking (even though me, Single-player Halo guy would give it 5-stars because I really do ""love it"" as Amazon says that rating means).

*Update 12/27/14: The title says it all. The game is working better every day. The value here is pretty astounding. There's just SO MUCH content for $45-55, even with its (increasingly disappearing) issues. AND if you were an early adopter of the game, you'll get to download Halo 3: ODST's campaign in 1080p 60FPS (one of my favorite Halo games ever!) AND the classic Halo 2 map ""Relic"" remastered all H2 Anniversary style. Very classy response by 343 to a very unfortunate flub on their part with such a major release, but things are thankfully getting better every day, and I am merciful. What's there now is a very good value. The single-player campaigns are more than worth it by themselves, the MP is quite fun now, and most of the smaller bugs have been totally ironed out. Hopefully the Halo 5 MP beta runs smoothly on the 29th. We shall see. Until then, take care, and toodles.

*Update 12/19/14: Another small update is in order. Many of the multiplayer issues that I experienced for the first couple weeks of the game's launch have been largely ironed out. The truth is, this game is worth the roughly $45-50 it costs right now based on the single-player content alone IN MY OPINION. Just playing through these campaigns alone will take you about 40 hours to do. To say nothing of the substantial updates that Halo 2 Anniversary has, as well as the smaller visual updates and performance improvements all the other games received. As far as multiplayer goes, the online functionality is much, much better. It's becoming harder and harder to fixate on the failings of the collection now. Of course, many are irrationally going around down-voting any positive reviews simply because they refuse to stop being crybabies, pretending as if the game's problems are still there even after having been fixed. To say this collection is irredeemable and only worth 1-star is nothing short of childish and irrational. Grow up. If you're a fan of Halo's SP like I am, this collection has always been a good choice, and if you love Halo for its Multiplayer like many are, then this is definitely worthy of consideration now. It's only getting better each week too. All that's left to fix are smaller bugs that don't really hamper the experience much anymore.

*Update 12/2/14: This will be a smaller update. After the last few updates/patches, the online MP is working a lot better for me now. Some playlists are better than others, but I haven't had a pretty good time finding matches and staying connected (Maybe I'm just lucky, lol). The BTB and Slayer playlists are the safest bets, it seems. So yes, things are working a bit better than they were before. It's not perfect though. From what I understand 343 has another big patch for later this week. Hopefully that irons out the rest of the problems, but we'll see. Again, single-player/story fans of Halo will be very happy with this package. Even with its issues, it's hard not to get your $60 worth with four fantastic campaigns (with one receiving a full-on Xbox One makeover and the rest receiving nice visual and performance enhancements) and a bunch of neat extras. I've beaten all the main campaigns on heroic difficulty, found all terminals and skulls, and am going through again because it's just so fun. HOWEVER, if you want this purely for MP, it's true that things are better now but I'd still wait a bit for them to make it perfect. Thanks for reading my review. I hope you find it helpful. Take care. Toodles

*Update 11/25/14: Whoo boy! Two weeks, a full-on update patch, and several smaller updates later and we're barely closer to functioning matchmaking online than we were on release day. In fact, it seems that where some issues were fixed, others popped up to replace them. I don't know what to tell you guys. From what I understand, the main cause of the problem is that the matchmaking has to juggle four different games (five if you include Halo 2 anniversary MP), with each one having its own unique engine. I have also read that they've brought in major Microsoft (not just Xbox) engineers in to fix their servers. They evidently tested the game before launch, but not under the kind of load a game this hyped would inevitably bring. For shame 343. To try and make good with players who bought the collection and had to deal with these issues, 343 is planning on giving everyone some sort of compensation. My fingers are crossed for free downloads of the SP campaigns from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-3-ODST/dp/B001HWB68K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo 3: ODST</a>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-Reach/dp/B002BSA20M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo Reach</a>&nbsp;at 1080p 60 fps), or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-5-Guardians/dp/B00DB9JV5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo 5: Guardians</a>&nbsp;at a discounted price and/or with extra content, but who knows? They do say it'll be good enough to make every Halo fan happy, which is a tall order considering the chaos and rage that rules the fanbase these days, lol. As always, I'll update my review as things come to light. While a lot of these explanations about the issues make sense, they're still inexcusable for such a major release for such a major franchise from such a major company. Again, the single-player stuff here absolutely kicks ass and if you love Halo for that, like I do, then this is a great collection. However, it's becoming harder and harder to grant 343 and this collection mercy as these completely inexcusable online issues persist. I know this update isn't much, but for what it's worth, I hope this, the other updates, and the review itself was helpful to you. Take care. Toodles.

*Update 11/18/14: Wow, a week in and STILL the MP problems have not been resolved. To be fair, there have been SOME improvements over the course of the past week, but as it stands, the online matchmaking is still in shambles. I REALLY hate to do this, but I'm going to have to dock another star off my score until these issues are fixed. A whole week of this is simply unacceptable and unprofessional. Thank GOD I bought this for the single-player campaigns, because those have been nothing but stellar. However, if I was like the majority of people who bought this for its MP, I'd be furious as well. If you want this collection for the SP campaigns, story, and local co-op, then this is an awesome collection. If you want this collection for MP, WAIT. From what I understand, 343 is planning a massive patch for later this week that will hopefully fix everything, but until then, I cannot in good conscience give this anything above 3-stars for now. I hope you find my review helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to read it, even if there are a bunch of crybaby haters downvoting all the top, vaguely positive reviews because of their frustration with the collection, and not based on the quality and merits of the reviews themselves (grow up please, lol). Take care. Toodles

*Update 11/13/14: I hate to do this, but I'm going to have to take off one star from my score due to the egregious multiplayer mess-up so far. I don't know if 343 wasn't ready for launch but didn't want to delay it past Halo 2's anniversary date or what, but they probably should have delayed it anyway. I am astounded at how badly 343 botched the online MP for such a hugely anticipated release. The online matchmaking is virtually non-functioning at this point, casting players into the limitless void of lobby purgatory with no hope of joining a match in anything resembling a reasonable amount of time. I have no doubt once they figure out the server issues, then things'll be great, but as of now, it's very hard for most to find a MP match. It's a damn shame, because everything else about the collection is fantastic. So there you go. Once 343 fixes the matchmaking issues, then I'll edit this review once again to 5-stars without hesitation. IF you want this collection primarily for the multiplayer, then I'd recommending holding off until its problems are fixed. If you're like me and you love Halo most of all for its single-player campaigns, co-op, and story, then this collection is, right now, top-of-the line quality and most definitely a MUST-BUY immediately. I hope that helps. It's been very sad for me to see all the anger and negativity surrounding this game. Everyone should be happy and celebrating Halo together right now, not turning on the game, 343, and each other, but alas, that is the world we live in these days. Thanks for reading my review at any rate. Also, thanks to all the haters giving out kneejerk downvotes to the top/positive reviews based on them enjoying and scoring highly a game you don't like, rather than the actual quality and helpfulness of the reviews themselves (Remember, reviews are, ultimately, subject to a reviewer's personal opinion/experience. Time to grow up ladies and gentlemen). Take care. Toodles.

*Original review*

Once in a blue moon, the gaming industry can bestow a gift that seems almost too good to be true. When I had read about the rumors of this collection before its official announcement, I laughed derisively. I thought there was no way a collection THIS good could possibly see the light of day. AT BEST, I thought MAYBE we'd get Halo 2 Anniversary, and we did. We also get something much more grand along with it. I love the Halo series. It is definitely in my top 3 favorite gaming series of all time, and I've played every entry within it to death. Now, I get to play it all again, and boy is it glorious. Fair warning: I'm going to try and keep this review concise, but I do want to be informative to all those wondering exactly what is in The Master Chief Collection, and whether or not it's worth its asking price (spoiler alert, it is, ten times over). If you don't like long reviews, you may want to skip this one.

*Halo 2 Anniversary*

I don't know about you, but it has always been the single-player campaigns and their great stories that have captivated me about Halo, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-2/dp/B00008J7NZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo 2</a>&nbsp;is no exception. As a matter of fact, Halo 2 is my favorite game in the series largely because of its SP campaign. It took the great sci-fi adventure format introduced in the first Halo and expanded it to new heights and depths. I always loved the overall melancholic, pensive mood in Halo 2's campaign. New characters, the Arbiter in particular, were really awesome additions to Halo's lore. It also refined and expanded on the gameplay in wonderful ways, and cemented Halo's place as THEE console first-person shooter. To be able to play its campaign with brand new visuals and audio is thrilling beyond compare. I had high expectations for this remake, as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-1-Anniversary/dp/B0050SYY5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo 1 Anniversary</a>&nbsp;is my golden standard for what a remake can and should be. Needless to say, Halo 2 Anniversary has not disappointed me. In fact, to my shock and surprise, it has exceeded my expectations.

If you played H1A, you know what to expect here in H2A. The updated visuals were built from the ground up for the X1 and are incredible. They are faithful to the spirit of the original while also updating things to make it feel brand new and to connect it more to games that came after its initial release in 2004. Awesome. The audio is likewise fantastic. The sound effects, including those of all weapons, have been redone and while they sound faithful to the original, they definitely pack a lot more punch than before, which I love. The incredible soundtrack by Marty O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori was also rerecorded by Skywalker Symphony Orchestra and it sounds incredible. Perhaps the most impressive upgrade in H2A is that they hired Blur, the studio who made the stunning CG cutscenes in<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-Wars/dp/B0034JKYO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo Wars</a>, to remake EVERY cutscene in Halo 2 in CG. Words cannot describe how breathtaking these are. It is almost literally like watching a live-action Halo movie at times. It's incredible.

Something to note about Halo 2 Anniversary is that it, like everything else in the package, plays at a smooth 60 FPS. While the rest of the package is all in 1080p (1920X1080), H2A alone has a resolution of 1328 X 1080, so not quite true 1080p. This is due to the fact its constantly rendering 2 engines simultaneously. It's still gorgeous though. Like I said, there are two engines running at all times during H2A. One is the actual, unaltered original game engine, which is constantly running so that the game plays EXACTLY as it did when it first came out, and then overlaid on top of that are the new visuals/audio/additions of Anniversary mode. Like in H1A, you can hit a button on the controller and the new engine disappears entirely, leaving you with the original Halo 2 in all its 2004 glory, old visuals, sound, and cinematcs in all. Unlike the 360 version of H1A, however, the switch between classic and anniversary mode is instantaneous. You can even do this during cutscenes, which shows just how advanced the new CG ones are by comparison. Awesome.

Just as in H1A, there are some new additions to the game to refresh things too. In addition to the classic skulls, they added in several new ones that are unlocked by default that change the game in various ways, which keeps things refreshing. There are also terminals hidden in each level ala H1A and Halo 3 that, when found, unlock videos that greatly expand on the lore surrounding Halo 2, with the Arbiter being the biggest focus. Since the Arbiter is one of my favorite Halo characters, I loved learning more about him. You can never have too much Arbiter! The terminals also offer glimpses of where the series is heading in Halo 5. Great stuff. There's also online co-op for the campaign, which is always swell.

Something I LOVE about 343's Halo remakes is how they update and enhance the original game's experience, while also showing great respect to the source material so as not to change/ruin any of it. You can tell they're cognizant of the original's greatness and celebrate it by updating all that has aged. I applaud this. Actually, they did that more here than they did in H1A, which had used some of Reach's art design to change the look of elites. Not here. Elites and their rank are only reflected in their armor color. Personally, I liked what they did with H1A, but oh well. They still did a great job.

*Halo 1 Anniversary, Halo 3, and Halo 4*

While Halo 2's campaign obviously received the most attention in this package, the other games were not left in the lurch. You also get H1A,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-3/dp/B000FRU0NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo 3</a>, and the more recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-4/dp/B00FKV8AK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo 4</a>, great games all. Each of these play exactly as they did before, but now in 1080p and 60 fps.  Each game has seen some other visual upgrades too, mostly in the form of enhanced lighting and shading effects. For some games, this will only make them prettier. H1A still looks great in my opinion. Halo 4 already looked like an Xbox One title to begin with, and these small enhancements only make it look more fantastic. The only game that looks noticeably aged is Halo 3. While it still has the same great art design it always had, and all the visual enhancements certainly make it look nicer, it's definitely the odd-man out compared to the rest. Here's hoping we get a Halo 3/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-3-ODST/dp/B001HWB68K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo 3: ODST</a>&nbsp;Anniversary collection in 2007 *fingers crossed*. Each entry's co-op mode is included and they all play online. There's not much else to say about these games really. They're awesome games with upgrades ranging from marginal (lighting/shading) to massive (the new framerate). For me, the single-player Halo guy, the inclusion of all of Master Chief's games really elevates what was already an awesome package.

*The Multiplayer*

While I've always loved Halo for its single-player and co-op most all, I do have a long history of enjoying its famous multiplayer as well. I don't usually play games for their MP, instead viewing it as a nice diversion once in a while at best, but Halo is one of the very rare video game series where I've sunk countless hours into the MP component. Within the collection, you will find the entire multiplayer modes from Halo 1-4 mostly intact, especially with regards to custom games, matchmaking less so. The engine from each game is perfectly preserved. Every Halo MP map ever is here, and that includes all expansion packs and even previously PC exclusive maps for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-1/dp/B00009TW6R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo 1</a>&nbsp;and 2. That's over 100 MP maps to play on! The menu system is fairly intuitive and easy to use, so you'll be able to pretty much jump into any general type of Halo MP experience you'd want. The amount of playlists are decent, with most matches giving you several options of maps from across that playlist's games to vote for. Each of the MP modes get their own dedicated servers, so theoretically you can play the entire MP suite on display here online in matchmaking! For Halo 1 players, this is a first on console! I have to say, the memories of 16-player LAN parties with huge, clunky SD TVs playing Halo 1 and 2, or being in awe at playing against other people online when I first bought Halo 3, have come flooding back. It's pretty awesome. The ONLY problem, and it is a BIG one, as of now as that the severs are virtually non-functioning. It takes FOREVER to find a match, if you can find one at all. This is unacceptable. I'm sure once these issues are fixed, it'll be great. Now though, this is probably the only blunder in the package.

HOWEVER, I do want to point out that when I say these are the original MP modes, I do really mean original in every way. That means the graphics from each ORIGINAL game is perfectly preserved, including clunky, aged 2001 Halo Combat Evolved graphics. So if you expected them to remake all the MP with this console generation's graphics, you'll be disappointed. Still, for the sheer amount of quantity and quality of fun to be had here, it's hard to complain. I like the nostalgia factor, personally. Like I said, the memories just keep rolling in, and I love it.

In addition to the original Halo MP modes being present, they also included a Halo 2 Anniversary MP mode. This features 6 classic Halo 2 maps, remade from the ground up in a new engine for the Xbox One. They even brought back developers who had worked on the original maps way back in the day to do this. Not only is it incredible to play these classic maps with spectacularly gorgeous visuals, they also freshened up the gameplay as well. Most of these remade maps feature ""gimmicks,"" for lack of a better word, that would have been impossible in 2004. These really mix things up and keep matches very interesting. This mode also features online matchmaking. Personally, I really enjoyed the Halo 2 Anniversary multiplayer mode included. It's pretty awesome.

Oh yeah, and then there's also a little thing called the Halo 5 MP beta included as well. Obviously it's not out yet, and once it is, it will be for a short, limited time, but still, Halo 5 MP Beta guys! Awesome.

*Miscellaneous schtuff*

There are a few things to address that don't really fall under any of the earlier categories, so I'll just stick them here. The collection features some new cutscenes that tease Halo 5, which is neat. Each Halo gets their own entire set of new achievements and 1000 gamerscore to unlock. Some are limited to a specific game, others are tied to the collection as a whole, and others are tied to MP. So, in this collection, you get a grand total of 450 achievements and 4500 gamerscore. Crazy! A lot of them are brand new to the series too. Everything in the game is accessible from one central menu system, so it's not like you have to select which game you want to play and then reboot to get to the others, which is great. They included playlists for the SP campaigns as well, such as one where you play all vehicle-focused SP levels across all games in a row, or play from the beginning of Halo 1 all the way to the ending of Halo 4 in one sitting (and one that adds all skulls active on legendary, wow, lol). When you factor in the ridiculous amount of MP playlists, as well as the expansive Forge options you get in the game, you get a collection that pretty much caters itself to every Halo fan. That's true for the controls as well. You can set a control scheme for each game individually, or one across all games. I appreciate that level of customization.

*Day One Patch*

Finally, I figured I should give you guys fair warning about something. There is a MASSIVE patch you have to download when you first pop in the disc. From what I understand, this was to keep the collection experience seamless, as there's so much content it would have taken two discs to fit it all. So, yeah, day one patch that is roughly 15 friggin' GB big. It is a pain to have to wait while it downloads, but once its on, everything's gold. I'm glad they did it this way as opposed to just printing 2 discs that I'd have to switch between frequently. Delayed gratification is the name of the game here I suppose. Once the patch is downloaded, everything runs smooth.

Whew... this collection is quite a package. I bought my copy at a midnight release party and have played it for several hours now, testing each part of the collection. I've played all of this content for countless hours before in their original format, so I feel I'm more than qualified to judge the quality of this collection. It's really common sense. Now I've peeled myself away to write this review. TMMC is absolutely bursting at the seams, filled with a ludicrous amount of content for something costing $60. Honestly, I'd have paid that much JUST for Halo 2 Anniversary alone. Not only do we get that, we also get the ultimate Halo multiplayer collection, Halo 1 Anniversary, Halo 3, and Halo 4 which all received some pretty nice additions and upgrades, a ton of new achievements, new skulls, hints of Halo 5, the Halo 5 beta, the Halo Nightfall TV series... I mean, it just goes on and on and on. I am absolutely floored by the sheer value on display here. Even Microsoft/Halo-haters have to admit this is an astoundingly good value when you weigh the content versus the cost. Just like Halo 1&2 Anniversaries have set my golden standard for remakes, so The Master Chief Collection has set my standard for gaming collections. Many game collections will come and go through the years, but I doubt any will be able to top this one for a good long while. If you're a Halo fan, buy this IMMEDIATELY, you will not regret it. If you've never played Halo before and want to get into the series, this is the perfect way to do so. This is, in my opinion, an absolutely essential purchase for every Xbox One owner. In fact, I JUST bought my Xbox One the other day specifically for this collection and I have no regrets. It's a superb collection at a splendid price. So buy it, prepare yourself for some incredibly awesome gaming ahead, and enjoy the ultimate omnibus of a legendary sci-fi game series.

You see, I want to go back in time and play Halo 2 Big Team. But I pretty much can't because there is no dedicated Halo 2 Big Team playlist. Instead Big Team is ALL of the Halo games (1-4) then there is a vote to decide which map to play on. Sometimes Halo 2 is not even on there. I like Halo 3 too and there is a lot of Halo 3 getting votes. Sometimes I'm stuck playing Halo 4 Big Team and I'm one of those people who think somehow 343 sucked the joy out of Halo in the making of 4. Remember the endorphins that went off in your brain when you ran over the camo or overshield on Coagulation? Ah, to be young and invisible with the sniper rifle. Let's take those away shall we? And replace it with (wait for it...) speed boost! You, well, move faster and there is like a trail so everyone can see you. Huh? Also for some reason vibration can't be disabled in Halo 4. I'm not a young man (hence me liking Halo 2) and I don't enjoy my hands getting kicked around while I'm trying to hit a tiny head (above the eyes). But when it's Halo 2 or Halo 3 it's so good that I have to go with the five stars.

For example, Destiny is king of the trash stories but it's gameplay more than makes up for it. It's more fast-paced and fluid and the social aspect of it is way more fun. I heard that Bungie is responsible for the first few Halo games and Destiny. I don't know if that's correct but it seems they evolved throughout the years while whoever does Halo now is just clinging on to what Bungie did and the games haven't really changed past the third one.

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,5,Its HALO,I have seen some critical reviews and those reviews getting a lot of Helpful Votes. I do not want to speak for those gamers but I believe they would agree that the reason they gave it a lot of criticism is because they care and they love the game(s) and want to hopefully catch the attention of the Studio to fix these issues so that gamers who might be new to the franchise grow the same kinda love for the series as we have. HALO is the only reason I bought an XBOX ONE I had no desire honestly to pick up another console at all. But it started calling me back and like a crack head with out rock I got the shakes and the only fix was to once again play the crap out of each and every game like I did when they first came out. I remember standing in line for 2 hrs for midnight to hit on release day at my local Video Gaming Store good times and I'd do it again in a heart beat. All that nostalgic crap being said and all the technical issues being voiced and hopefully fixed or in motion to be fixed. These games imperfections and all should be the only reason to buy an XBOX ONE whether you have played them or not its worth every penny. These are my own personal opinion(s) but I think the majority of the critics and/or fans of the franchise would agree.,10-07-2016

It's one of the  Best of game disc in terms of bang for your buck
You get Halo 1-4 plus lots of multi player all on one disc

Graphics: Halo 1+2 are remastered
The Halo games imo never had the best graphics
I've only played the remastered original Halo it looks good for a title that's almost 15 years old

Audio:  The audio is amazing getting decoded DTS sound for any HQ triple A title
The score is really good forgot how good the soundtrack was! also the sound f/x are really good each one of  the guns have there own sound

The Controls:  feel good but, you can't zoom with any gun this is also a problem with the 360 version of Halo 3
If you haven't been playing home consoles that long maybe your first console was the PS2, Game Cube, Original Xbox
This might throw you off
But, during the early FPS there was no zoom (Doom1-3  Duke Nukem 3D , Wolfenstein 3D, even a newer title from 2004 Painkiller had no zoom. The zoom thing is more of a age thing I'm sure

The Story: I personally never could get into the story of Halo i understand it has this epic Star Wars style  lore
But, i never could get into it

It was months before I could actually play the game. I waited and waited. Finally got better patch after patch. Currently it works fine, few small glitches but nothing game breaking. I enjoyed the updated cutscenes, they look great. As for the guy who said they look worse, must be tough when you're blind. Mutiplayer is fun, great to play the old maps again.

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,3,"Lazy Port, Lots of problems, needs to be patched.","No online cooperative play for any of the campaigns?  what?

Multiplayer Matchmaking is far too simplistic and limited.

Players are robbed of choices that are essential to a great remaster like this game is pretending to be.

I personally hate Halo 4's multplayer, but I have no way of excluding myself from Halo 4 games.

My favorite multiplayer mode is big team battle, because it has 16 players, but the flawed matchmaking system first finds you teamates, and then lets them vote on the map. If the other players choose a Halo 4 map, the only way to get out of it is to quit and leave your teamates down a player.

Instead of being able to choose big team battle by game or by level, microsoft forces you to get stuck in one of 3 choices the game picks for you.

You can't just enter matchmaking for Halo big team battle, or Halo 2 BTB, or Halo 3 BTB, Your only option is to pick BTB for all the halo games.

You can't pick what map you want to play on either.

This is a problem because the game chooses the same maps over and over, and you've got no recourse to stop it.

It's the most oversimplified matchmaking you could possibly imagine for a remaster that includes 4 games.

I am exhausted of being offered the same maps to vote for over and over.

There should be 100 more matchmaking lobbies than they currently have. They've got literally 10% of what they should have.

Feel like playing Halo one big team battle? too bad, because blood gulch is the only map that you ever have a chance to vote for.

I am still waiting to play sidewinder. I could say that for dozens of maps I have wanted to play that the game never lets you vote on.

I am so tired of getting forced into playing Halo 4. I'm not an jerk, so I can't just ditch my teammates.

Also, you can't play small or medium sized maps in Big Team Battle. They just rip the choice from you. Ever wanted to see what a small or medium sized map plays like with 16 players? Too Bad.

Singleplayer : If you're like me, then you've fallen in love with the main menu from Halo 1, Halo 2, and to a lesser extent Halo 3. Too bad, cause they're gone.

Rather than being able to choose your game and being directed to the original menu screen, all the games have the same menu screen some blue planet with asteroids floating around it.. It sucks.  what does it have to do with Halo?

When I play Halo CE, I want to see the massive ring floating in space. When I play Halo 2, I want to see new mombasa in beautiful blue. Instead, you get some background that means absolutely nothing to those games. Where's the music you're nostalgic for? All gone. It's just a lazy port.

They'e redone the music for the games, and you can tell they sound different. When I play Halo CE, I want the exact same music I remember, not redone tracks. And these audio files are tiny, so why they couldn't both be inlcuded is beyond me. You cannot choose to listen to the original music, it forces the remixed tracks on you. Why? Why screw the games up so bad?

Also, the music will play too loud over the dialogue, making you miss parts of the story.

You cannot change between remake graphics and original graphics during cutscenes. Not a big deal, unless you're playing Halo CE and watching the long opening cutscene. You're forced to watch the anniversary remake, because you can't change back to the original until you reach gameplay. man it's astounding how bad they botched this.

During gameplay, you can switch between remake and original graphics, which is kinda cool on the surface, but in truth, is a huge mistake. There's long loading screens for every level now, and the background of these loading screens is a low res image from the hideous remake.

Remember playing Halo 2 and 3 without loading screens? No longer.

And Halo CE's iconic blue ring loading screen is gone. What? Looking at the ugly reskinned anniversary instead. man how do you screw something like this up?

See, you can't just choose to play the original game and ditch the hideous loading screens, no, you must suffer playing both games at once.

No original music, no original loading screens, no original title screens. Unbelievable.

The games just aren't Halo anymore. They screwed all of them up.

Finally, the worst offence:

There have been no polygon count increased for ANY of the original Halo games, only the remakes.

Unbelievable.

Why they couldn't have had the guys at bungie update the polygon counts is unforgivable.

The games just look dated because of it.

You've got these beautiful textures, animations and particle effects, mixed up with these horribly low poly objects.

Every gun, every character, every hand, everything, is sickeningly low poly. Like, you can count in a few seconds how many poly's went into chiefs hands and gun.

Halo CE and Halo 2 are from an era of gaming where polygon processing was in extremely short supply, and it shows.  Every single render in both games is visibly low poly.  Everything.  How gorgeous could these games look today with just a little TLC?

i just... Cannot believe how lazy these developers are. They could have let Bungie update their game really easily, but because Microsoft doesn't care, it didn't happen.

There's still time to fix all these problems, they just have to get off their lazy asses and make it happen. Contact the guys at Bungie and let them increase the poly counts.

Patch the game, you morons.

As for the anniversary remakes :  They looks worse than the original games most of the time, which is really sad considering their high polygon counts.",11-22-2015

The multiplayer does have its issues and waiting for matches can be a bother but this has definitely improved since its release. And honestly if you miss the old halo multiplayer like i did you won't mind waiting a bit longer for a match.

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,5,A great addition to any Halo veteran's collection.,"I won't review the game in this review b/c it's a collection of games that have been available forever.
I won't review online play because honestly, I think it's a shame that online has taken such a priority over campaign that the campaign has suffered over the years. I guess I'm just too old school. I won't apologize. Plus, you've read it a million times, MS messed it up. I can't blame them trying to combine the elements of four different games into one online experience would be difficult in any situation.

The graphic upgrades for this game are absolutely gorgeous. There are also additional scenes and nuances that add to the depth of the experience. Watching the Halo 2 cut scenes rendered in our next generation graphics is an absolute pleasure. The in-game graphics are incredible too. Seeing the grunts upgraded to how they look now is just so fun and cool. When you press the select button on the XB1 controller, you can toggle between original and updated graphics and audio so you can compare. That's a fun experience too.

The terminal system just plain sucks. Having to freeze the game, open Halo Waypoint, wait for the video buffer, etc is just not worth it, IMO. But once you're watching the videos, they're a cool addition.

The Master Chief collection was a great idea, and as far as the campaign aspect, and keeping the story alive and well, this collection did a great job.  All of the campaigns have been remastered for the newer generation of hardware, and it shows.  It's even more entertaining that the developers took the time to add in a feature that allows you to press the back button of the controller at any time in the remastered games to change the graphics between the remaster and the original.  343 Studios did a bang-up job with the remasters for all the games, and stayed very true to the originals throughout, with absolutely no story changes whatsoever.  Having the iconic main installments to this franchise all on one disk is a very powerful thing.  The cohesion that 343 was able to achieve between the games in the collection was very well done and obviously had some thought behind it's execution.  The campaigns are all enjoyable in their remastered and original glory, and still thoroughly enjoyable.

This collection, does however, only include some of the Halo games, and not all of them.  It includes, as expected, only the ones where the protagonist is Master Chief.  This means you will find Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo 4 in this collection, but you will not find Halo 3: ODST, Halo Reach, or the RTS Halo spin-off, Halo Wars.  I really would have liked to have seen Halo 3: ODST and Halo Reach included in this collection, but I completely understand why they were not included, and nothing was docked for that, just a preference thing, as I really enjoyed Halo Reach.

The reason I docked a star is for the multiplayer that 343 decided to implement within the collection.  It is still yet broken and has many bugs and issues, even this long after launch.  I personally, don't attempt to play much of the multiplayer, and really just wanted the collection for the single player stories, but the fact that a section of the game is utterly broken and was even worse at launch leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth and hole in my trust for 343 Studios capabilities in the future for the Halo franchise.

In short, if you want to relive the glory days of the Halo franchise, in remastered graphics glory, this is the place to do it, and have them all in one place together to experience one after the other, is a great thing.  But if you're looking to play the multiplayer of the collection, be aware that is is severely crippled and has a lot of issues, many of which make it not worth the time to try and play.",09-15-2015

The multiplayer works pretty well most of the time. I really only have two gripes, and I'm sure if you play this game then you will agree with me.

1. Menu for multiplayer - This game has a multiplayer menu that jumbles everything together. I was hoping that you could go to a separate matchmaking lobby for each game - go to a lobby and pick Halo 2 snipers or rumble pit playlist. This is not the case. There is one lobby and the gametypes you can pick are must much more limited - you can pick slayer and that includes Halo 2 and Halo 3 maps. I would have really liked if there would have been a main menu that allowed to select Halo, Halo 2, Halo 3 or Halo 4 and from there went to the same menu you could expect from each respective game. This leads to...

2. Controls! - I never thought about it, but the controls changed from Halo 2 to Halo 3 and even to Halo 4. You can't just use the legacy controls for each game. They created a new ""Universal"" default that just doesn't quite provide the one size fits all that they intended it for. Sure, there are several variations but none of them work well with all of the games (grenade switching..deploying items). I can't believe they don't just let you customize the controls for exactly how you want them. It's not a big deal, just a little annoying.

All in all, these aren't two huge issues that should prevent you from getting the game. They, unfortunately, along with the initial poor matchmaking experience, are two common sense things, that prevent this collection from being as great as it should be.",08-28-2015

The story will seem incredibly dull and unless you have a friend to help, you may as well just be making yourself mad just to get the achievements for the games.

As for the multiplayer, yeah... no. Needs work. I find myself at the lobby screen having the game ""Search for player"" more often than I am actually playing the game.

I've played every entry in the series and they are all great in their own way. Even the worst Halo is better then the majority of its competition on the market. The master chief collection is the ultimate Halo fan tribute to a franchise that almost never disappoints. Now I will say that I play Halo more for the story then for the multiplayer, so my review doesn't really factor in any continuing multiplayer issues. If you're looking for the entire series playable in 1080p at 60fps, then you've come to the right place. My one major gripe is that Halo: Reach isn't in this collection.

Secondly, it sucks the game does not continue with the team you played previously, thus necessitating you to re-start matchmaking. Thirdly, there are few game-types for the amount of Halo's available. A Big Team Battle should be available for each halo, for example, as each game has it's perks. All in all, the fun thins out very fast from having to re-start matchmaking over and over again, with a limited amount of maps and games for each individual Halo. In the end, it was well worth it, as playing  the original Halo online was priceless. I am nervous about Halo 5, as the expectations of Halo MCC were high and the delivery was borderline.",08-23-2015

I have had it for 3 or 4 months now and played it one night then packed it back away in its case. The multiplayer was horrible and buggy. The one thing that never lets you down in any Halo game is it's story so that was the one positive.

Back to my second chance for Halo MCC. 343 has done so much work on this game to fix it that it shoukd have never been released in the first place with all the bugs. Multiplayer is finally better. Not perfect but much more bearable. I didn't experience much lag, however I do have a 100mbps connection. I finally enjoyed myself for the first time since Halo 4. There are still improvements that need to be worked on like the match making speeds and map loading. But all in all this is finally starting to look up from when I originally purchased this. Too bad they finally fixed it right before Halo 5 comes out. I look forward to that but hopefully 343 won't make me look like a fool a second time...",08-21-2015

Even if the multiplayer was non-functional, this would still be at least worth 4 stars.
This is the remastered collection of Halo 1-4 and for games like 1 and 2 that are over 10 years, old, they still play better than most FPS's today. Why? Updated graphics for all and outstanding redone cut-scenes for Halo 2 make them still very nice to look at. 343 did an excellent job of bringing these all up to date. I love being able to switch between the original and updated graphics at any time. You can really appreciate all the work that went into the upgrade while still trying to keep true to the original artists intent. The gameplay and controls are still smooth as butter. The enemy AI is still very smart and puts up a good fight. Plenty of challenge on normal difficulty. The score is iconic. There's something other worldly about the music that puts you into this universe. It's mellow during exploration and picks up during fights. The story is a grabber. What is this? What happened? Who are these new enemies? What is Halo? The more you know, the more you'll want to know. The characters are also very original and the voice acting is excellent. There's a reason why Halo has reached the levels of popularity that it has.
The game has been updated and the problems that plagued the online portion of the game have been fixed. Multi-player is up and running as it should so that's not a problem any longer. Many developers have had difficulties adapting to both next gen systems. A little patience was all that was needed till they fixed it. It's Halo after all. Microsoft wasn't going to allow their flagship franchise to fail in one of its crucial features.
With Halo 5: Guardians on the way this fall, now is a great time to get up speed for those who've never played or haven't played in awhile. This is a great collection at a dirt cheap price. This is an essential for any Xbox One owners collection.",06-26-2015

As for 3 and for there's improved lighting and textures but that's about it. 1080p 60 FPS on all of them except halo 2 anniversary which has a slightly lower resolution. Bottom line it's gorgeous. Now campaigns have skulls and CO-OP and also playlists of all the different missions none of which I really cared about but you might like it

Multiplayer:
It's the multiplayer of all 4 games we all know and love with all the maps. The way it works matchmaking is in different playlists (Ex. Halo 2 anniversary, SWAT, Etc.) some are permanent some get rotated. Custom games work like they always have and Spartan OPS and forge is back for all games except for halo 1. The multiplayer is fun like it's always been and brings me back to the old halo 2 days

Bad stuff:
The game is constantly being updated due to the multiple matchmaking bugs it launched with. I personally bought in December so a good amount of these were gone but there still ironing out bugs to this day. So mainly this review is for those who haven't bought the game yet.

Final Verdict:
In its current state since the Halo 5 beta is over it's still a lot of fun for old and new fans alike. So at the price below 40$ right now I'd say pick it up.",05-07-2015
https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,4,Fun,"In the time of dinosaurs when the nintendo 64 was dying, and the next generation of consoles was fighting for the throne, I remember the first halo coming out.
I never had the opportunity to play the original until this came out.
I have passed 2,3 and 4, but I could never get into the mythology of it.
I figured the original would explain it q little more in depth.
I was wrong.
nevertheless, I can see why so many people call this the best game ever.
While I don't agree, I can see why at the time of its original release it was the best thing since ham and cheese.
As for the rest of the titles in the collection, I already know what to expect.
I am not a big fan of the franchise,  but I enjoy a challenge and the unusual controls help make the experience a lasting one.
I bought this game for a few reasons.
A. It was only $8. (I had a few giftcards I won).
B. It's 4 full games.(plus the halo 5 beta)
C. My kids love playing the multiplayer mode.
I bought this almost 6 months after release so I imagine most of the bugs are gone.
I have not tried the multiplayer mode yet, but I can say that for someone who is not an avid halo fan I have already clocked in over 4 hrs in the first session.
Amazon currently has this game at $32, do yourself a favor and pick it up before it goes back up as this collection is one of the few good exclusive things the Xbox one offers.
I will update this review after I play multiplayer to see if it's still buggy.
I recommend this game.
It's fun and pretty straight forward,
but if you're a first timer and are looking for an epic shooter, maybe you should try something else.

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,3,Master Chief couldn't finish this fight.,"First off, I played every Halo campaign (H1, H2, H3, H:ODST, Reach, and H4) at least once on varying difficulties and logged in around 500+ hours online in multiplayer for each game (H1, H2, H3, H4). So of course getting the MCC was a no brainer as the ultimate fan service a video game franchise can offer.

I held off buying it because of the issues people were having, so I waiting until March 2015 to buy it. While many of the past issues were fixed, it's still nowhere as functional as how the previous Halo games were handled. Here's what I've noticed so far from 50+ hours of multiplayer gameplay:
1) Matching people in Ranked matches are a joke: level 30s and level 40s against level 10s? Ok, that's fair </sarcasn>
2) Crashes before the game starts
3) Voice chat doesn't work. you pretty much need to be in Party Chat to hear your teammates.

And now what was removed from previous Halo games that baffle me:
1) No postgame lobbies, do we really have to back out and choose a playlist everytime?
2) Fun playlists! No action sack? griffball? Flood? BTB heavies? these gametypes made Halo fun.
3) Firefight missing.
4) Uncustomizable Spartans/Elites.
5) Nothing to unlock outside of avatars/nameplates makes replay value pointless.

Bottom line: If you want this for the single player/co-op campaigns, it's amazing and worth the price. If you are a multiplayer enthusiast like me, prepare to be disappointed. The nostalgia wears off rather quickly.",04-17-2015

I waited a while so they can sort out the bugs and other issues. It playes through the campaign well and the HD mode looks great on 1-2. 3 however seems the same with no changes in graphics compared to 7th gen.

Having all 4 games on one disks with all levels unlocked is very convenient. It's better than having a bunch of games taking up space on my Xbox games shelf. The menue is pretty easy to navigate. It has frozen on me two or three times durring the loading screen in halo 2 but that was the only time it happened.

I wish they could have upgraded halo 3 graphics to match up with how well 1 & 2 looked. The HD to non HD graphics toggle works OK. Seems to work better on 2 than 1. I was a little bummed that the audio was exactily the same in HD and non HD mode for halo 1. On halo 2 they made an HD mode for both audio and graphics. 3 and 4 plays very well with minimal issues and saving progress always works as it should.

I'm not much of a live person so I don't know enough to tell you how well it works but from what a friend of mine tells me it works great for him now.

I understand why people are upset. The multiplayer is VERY slow, and finding maps on an irrelevant game in the collection, say Halo 3, is virtually impossible. BUT, we have to remember that the multiplayer was not the MAIN portion of this release. The whole point was to bring all of the Halo CAMPAIGN missions onto one console and onto one disc. THAT was the main point. With this being the case, this is an incredible release, especially with a Halo 2 Anniversary touch up, which is unreal by the way. This is a fantastic collection that really brings the Halo series back on its feet for Halo 5 and for next gen.

And really enjoyed the Multiplayer Beta from Halo 5. Also finally got around to playing through Halo 4.

Let me reiterate this. The multiplayer beta of Halo 5 had less problems than the Master Chief Collection.

This collection, however, is too broken for release. Achievements don't unlock, portions of the campaign don't work, playlists don't load.

At its heart, this is little more than a remastered Halo 2. The first was remastered for Xbox 360, and was just ported to Xbox one. Likewise, halo 3 and 4 are simple ported as well with no graphical upgrades.

It is nice to have all 4 installed so you can pick up and play at any time. The multiplayer has been so broken I haven't even tried playing, but 343 seems to be fixing that.

I haven't played the other games yet, will update when i have.  I haven't played Halo 4 at all so I immediate;y wanted to play that game.  Comparing the graphics in the MCC to video and pictures of the 360 version, let me say they look great for being converted for XB1.  It has been years since i played Halo, and the moment the chant comes on at the start menu it brought back the excitement of years past when playing.

I also played multiplayer (well, more like tried to play multiplayer), but couldn't as it was totally unusable for me for a few days after launch. Once I could play, the games would take upwards of five minutes or more to load, and at that point, I had found something else I'd rather be doing, or the game would disconnect.

Really! First of all, Halo is not about the multiplayer. It's about the story and the single player campaign. The A.D.D crowd are trying to make Halo about the multiplayer just as they did with COD. Halo multiplayer is just a side piece to the single player campaign. Always has been and always will be. The creators are trying to tell a story through a game and you just can't do that in multiplayer like you can do in single player. For those of you who need the interaction of multiplayer to make it through your sad lives, go play something else if you are not happy with this title. But don't give this title poor scores because the multiplayer isn't up to your standards. The four single player campaigns alone make this title a four or five star title. The developers are probably spending most of their time on the next Halo title as opposed to making patches for this title's multiplayer. For you people who feel that multiplayer makes or breaks a title, you need to go and spend some time by yourself. It's not the multiplayer that you are so upset about, it's not being able to interact with people! The needy generation rears it's ugly head!",02-25-2015

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,5,The Ultimate Halo Experience - Not Perfect,":UPDATE 5/17/15: After several large updates, matchmaking has improved significantly, both in speed and consistency. Quitters are now being penalized. Not perfect but on the right track. Halo 3 ODST and remastered Halo 2 map Relic still on their way as free DLC.

The Halo franchise is huge. It launched the Xbox as a console and helped it maintain its place in the video game industry, It's been around since 2001 and has countless amounts of content from the games themselves to books, toys, videos and montages, clothing, etc... All this considered, the hype for this collection as another continuation of the Xbox/Halo exclusive fan base was equally huge. I purchased an Xbox One knowing this would come out and it would be a Day One buy. I did NOT regret that decision.

As many have pointed out, the game is flawed in numerous ways. The multiplayer being the biggest affected aspect, games tend to be inconsistent. Players unexpectedly drop. The servers can be laggy at times. Party and voice chat can be negatively impacted. And worst yet, matchmaking itself has been so problematic, I've sat in a lobby with ""Joining Session"" displayed for over half an hour with not a single game. Needless to say, terribly frustrating. HOWEVER...

The campaigns are, as they were the first time, incredible. The remastering of 1 and 2 are excellent, especially 2. Just for the campaigns alone, in full glorious 1080p/60 fps 99% of the time, were worth the price. I am a big fan of the multiplayer aspect, so it's been a real pleasure and nostalgic trip playing on these classic maps and gametypes that truly define Halo (pre-Halo Reach/4). 343 Industries has promised continued support and future improvements and they have been making the experience faster, more consistent but they have their work cut out for them.

I gave the MCC 5 stars because this is THE Halo experience all wrapped into one disc. It may have its flaws but I have personally experienced a huge improvement since launch and it will only get better from here. Fans of Halo, snag this when it goes on sale. New to Halo? Here's the place to start if you own an Xbox One. The Halo Community is bigger than one flawed release. Here's your chance to find out why and become a member!",02-01-2015
https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,4,"Great game, if you have a LOT of time to kill","This product is exactly what was promised. I didn't realize at the time I bought it how much the video game industry has changed since they made the first and second Halo. Only the graphics are different in those games, not controls or gameplay and you figure out real fast that some of those changes were for the better. It's fun to play the games again anyway, they're just how you remember them, just better graphics. The two big things I don't like are: 1 This game requires 80gb of space on your hard drive, and you have to install all four games, not just the one you would like to play, and 2 It takes at least five minutes, probably longer, to get into a multiplayer match.

All 4 halo campaigns are great and it's nice to have them all in one package for the Xbox one but unfortunately the Mcc is much more than its single player components.

The whole collection was pitched as a halo multiplayer fan's dream. We were promised, matchmaking including all halo maps and all game types  on dedicated servers running at 60fps. It runs at 60fps, but as of Jan 23rd 2015 the multiplayer is still broken. Team slayer and halo2 anniversary are the only game types I can connect to on a consistent basis and even then the wait times are unacceptable averaging from 5 to 10 minutes with 5 minutes being very rare. A Lot of the time it doesn't connect at all. It doesn't help that after each game you are thrown out of the lobby to start matchmaking again. This never allows you to get into a rhythm.

I've waited a few months to give Microsoft time to fix the issues and with each patch I get my hopes up and then they are crushed. I love big team battle and would love to play it but I've yet to connect to a game.

Had Microsoft just launched it with the single player component and added in the multiplayer later I think the fan base while still being upset would have had a bit more patience. In the state it's in, I would have to say avoid this collection unless all your after is the single player experience.",01-23-2015
https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,1,A scam product Microsoft rushed out to squeeze some money from their most loyal fans,"I am a long time Halo fan. I got the Xbox for Christmas in 2001 with a copy of Combat Evolved and played the series diligently since. I loved the 360 entries - Halo 3, ODST, Reach, and 4 were all great great games I had tons of fun with. I even bought and played through Combat Evolved Anniversary and enjoyed the MP they put in that one. So, needless to say, I was as excited for this release as I could possibly be for a game at my age. I preordered it and eagerly loaded it up on day one. Sure enough, the single player Halo in HD and 60fps looked great. The Halo games in single player are the best around, so you really can't beat a package with four exemplary singleplayer experiences (with a fifth to come later, ODST). Multiplayer though? Nothing? Yea, nothing. The multiplayer in this game was totally, completely busted. Even now, two months later, the best I can say is that it basically works most of the time. However, it's not even close to what Microsoft promised and claimed.

As a jaded old gamer, I find my gut emotions about this release to be quite surprising. I feel like Microsoft straight up lied to their biggest fans and supporters by hastily shipping a non-working product. I can't believe they treated their signature franchise this way, and I was so upset I didn't even go near the Halo 5 beta in spite of the positive reception it has gotten. I've seriously considered selling my Xbox One and sticking with PS4, just because I don't want to support a company that will do this to their fans. It's awful. Don't buy this game.",01-22-2015

Fast forward to now, the game is finally working as it should. By that I mean you aren't sitting in matchmaking with a screen saying ""Searching"".............. for god knows how long. The game is much more stable now and is worth purchasing for the content. Games play smoothly and I don't get kicked anymore.

Only thing I'm disappointed about is the only Playlist that currently has ranked is Halo 2 Team Anniversary. All the other playlist have no ranking system which we all thought they would have.

*update 1/10/15*

Tried for a few hours to play halo tonight, ended up reading a book while waiting for games to load. it takes about 30 minutes to find a game, and half the games you find the other team all quits or it freezes up. all in all you get to play about 5 minutes of halo for each hour of waiting.

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,4,I liked the game despite its issues...also people tend to be more wrong when they're angry.,"I want to start this review with the observation that most people rated this game before all the patches. If you see any reviews from before around December 27th, disregard them because those people were judging a game that hasn't had the patches released to fix errors and add features. That makes all those angry release day reviews wrong and you shouldn't pay any attention to them. Anything updated or written after December 27th is probably okay assuming it isn't an angry, dejected fanboi. Okay, so my quick review.

Pros
1. The multiplayer does, in fact, work. It's a little wonky here and there but it does work and it works about as well as prior Halo games (which have always been wonky). I don't know if people are mis-remembering ""the good old days"" or if they simply didn't play that much, but matchmaking always took 3-5 minutes on a good night and 5-10 minutes on a bad night to get into a game. That hasn't changed at all from any of the online Halo games. I've had matchmaking do its ""search loop"" twice since I started playing it and a quick ""exit and re-enter"" fixed it both times. It's not nearly as bad as the angry mob of 1-star reviewers make it seem. Some people like to just be angry.

2. The 60fps makes these games look intensely smooth. It's most notable during Halo 3 because it is so much smoother than it used to be. 60fps ftw.

3. The graphical enhancements are awesome. Especially for Halo 2. The ability to turn it on and off is not only amazing and impressive, but also tactically useful. When I need the textures turned down to differentiate from landscape and bad guy, putting it down to the old graphics settings with the older lighting and textures makes it way easier to see bad guys at a distance and in low-light scenarios. Cool!

4. Halo 1, 2, 3, and 4 campaigns in all of their glory for under $60 is glorious.

5. I like in matchmaking that any game could be any map from any title. You could play Blood Gulch one game then Valhalla the next. Halo 2 mechanics one game and Halo 4 mechanics the next. That's really fun and a good way to shake things up and keep matchmaking interesting. I think it would've been an inferior experience if playlists were done ""by game"".

6. Halo 5 Guardians preview until January 15th = win.

7. The ability to customize controls, armor suits (colors, etc), and more for each individual game was a good touch although I generally just leave everything the same from game to game.

Cons
1. The matchmaking stats don't report right. I went 5 kills, 17 deaths in my first match (I hadn't set the controls yet and kept tossing power drains at myself...oops). I came right back and went 13-10 in the next game, and then 17-9 in my third game. Despite winning 2 of 3 games, the game reports my wins at 1 and my Kill/Death as 5-17. This hasn't changed much in the week I've been playing it. The same goes for campaign. I've done 2 Halo 2 missions and it says I've done 6...and I even got some achievements I definitely didn't do.

2. The customization is about 50% there. You can change your armor colors but you can't actually see the change in the menu. In the later Halo games, you could pick your individual pieces of armor (especially Halo 4) which you can no longer do. Either let us customize or don't, but don't give us half of it...and not even the cool half.

3. There are small graphical glitches here and there. Parts of the menu kinda bug out (they still work) every now and then. I suspect future patches will fix this and it doesn't affect game play so I'm not overly concerned.

4. There is one ranked playlist on multiplayer and I don't like the game type. Lame.

5. I bought the game and the next day they announce that they're giving away ODST to people who bought it before I did. Lame.

6. No Halo: Reach online playlists, maps, or mechanics. Lame because I really liked Reach's multiplayer

7. After matches, the game bounces you from the lobby in matchmaking. Given that it's much harder to see who you've played with recently (compared to the Xbox 360), that means it's harder to find the people you just played with and invite them to a game. It's essentially anti-social unless you're already in a party with friends. This is as much Microsoft's fault as it is 343's because the Xbox One's menu system kind of puts the ""social"" aspect in the background for some silly reason.

Overall, this title has had a lot of problems. However, I bought the game anyway because even if multiplayer was broken, there are still 4 Halo games worth of campaign and that alone is worth the $60. As it turns out, 343 has been doing a LOT better than the reviewers here would have you believe. Multiplayer feels like a Halo game and the minor issues don't affect the game play very often. Given that 343 has announced that they're holding back work on their next Halo game (due out in Spring of 2015...and no I'm not talking about Guardians, I'm talking about another side game) to fix this one, I have confidence that the game will be more or less what was expected.

Yes, it sucks that the game was released in the shape it was in. Sometimes budget constraints and deadlines are a real pain. Anyone who has ever worked in a deadline-driven environment can tell you that sometimes you release things you didn't get to finish all the way. At least 343 is doing something to make it right. Take a lesson, Ubisoft, because Assassin's Creed Unity still sucks.

I would recommend this game to Halo fans who have dealt with ""those Halo issues"" through the first 4 Halo games (and those who believe those issues didn't exist are wrong or stupid, it's always taken several minutes to get into a matchmaking game). Casual gamers may want to wait a few more months for 343 to sort out the remaining issues...but there really aren't all that many.",01-04-2015

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,1,Garbage. Shame on 343.,"This game is garbage. It was clearly rushed and as of 12/31/2014, multiplayer matchmaking still doesn't work correctly. That's pretty bad for a game released in mid-November.

The biggest problems with matchmaking continue to be the game's inability to keep your party together from one game to another and the game's inability to evenly parse out teams for each match.

5v5 matches on maps designed for 4v4 play? Yep.
4v3 matches 75% of the time? Yep.
Splitting a party up across two teams? Yep.
Freezing at the post-game menu screen and/or getting dropped from your party? Yep.

Despite the fact that 343 claims that they've fixed many of these issues, they HAVE NOT done so. Additionally, as many have noted, Halo and Halo 2 are ported from their previous PC versions as opposed to the original Xbox versions. Because of this, glitches exist in these games (both single player and multiplayer) that shouldn't even be there to begin with.

Again, this game is garbage. It's a cash grab. Buy it only if you want to play through the single player or if you plan to play multiplayer by yourself (which works reasonably well). Don't buy this game if you plan to join a party to play online.",12-31-2014

The campaigns are awesome, H2 anniversary is lovely, but that multiplayer is still broken. If I try to find a match with more than one person in the roster, the game says ""one or more players is not ready to find a match."" I'm tired of AAA developers getting away with releasing unfinished products.

I got the XBOX ONE-Titanfall Bundle last week and so I spent the time playing The Master Chief Collection.

343 Industries had really screwed the pooche this time.

I felt like I got my moneys worth at the same time I feel like I got cheated, I blame Microsoft Games Studios primarily for this.

This is at least better than using XBConnect to do all of your online gaming, especially since this includes Halo 2 Multiplayer Map Pack 2005 Collection [but fortunately that sweet Pete Stacker Hotel Zanzibar Video has now been included] and Blastacular Map Pack for Halo 2 and since this includes the for mentioned content now you don't have to buy and mod an Original XBOX in order to get this content and even then I considered downloading of these map packs off of unofficial sites-services to be illegal and why would you play Halo 2 Vista which has the 5 times activation malarkey.

This release has been said to be worse than Battlefield 4 in terms of multiplayer but at least this release is not to the degree of terrible that DOOM II Gameplay Mechanics Bug [Doors not opening properly] in DOOM 3 BFG Edition is and not to mention some of the problems that are in the latest Assassin's Creed game Unity.

Top 4 Annoying Bugs & Problems To Look for In a Video Game That Is Multiplayer or Otherwise
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*****************************************************************************
Major Bugs or Issues If Your Game Is Strictely or has a Multiplay Componnent
*****************************************************************************

04 - Network Issues [The usual such as not being able to connect to a server or having lag issues and this collection had this but they just recently fixed it as of March-June of 2015]

*****************************************************************************
There Are Three Types of Bugs That Can Kill a Game for Me and These Are It
*****************************************************************************

03 - GUI Interface and This Includes Save Games Either Being Deleted or Save Games Not Saving [This collection had this but they just recently fixed it as of March of 2015 and the reason this is higher than the next two is because I deal with interface problems first as you should do in a review]

02 - Game Immersion Breaking Bugs [Textures unintentionally looking funny-model rendering issues or issues with sound effects-music not properly playing and this thankfully does not have much of this as AC Unity does because it is very very minor]

01 - Gameplay Mechanic Bugs [Look up Superman 64 and you will understand one of the other problems with this type of bug, this instantly makes me put a game down and never play it again and this collection thankfully very much does not have this at all as far as I know]
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Music, visuals, sound and plus better cutscenes [and yes the cutscenes are prerendered but what are you going to do about it, at least they remastered them] make this a better experience for both old school fans [maybe not so much for every old school fan because they are people who do not like certain changes but at least they kept model consistency by keeping the models for the Non Player Characters, Characters, Vehicles as well as keeping the textures as consistent with Halo 2 and Halo 3 ODST] who have played Halo and Halo 2 and new fans who are just starting to play the original games but I am not as much a fan of the multiplayer component of Halo 2 Anniversary as I am a fan of Halo 2 Classic Multiplayer.

Envy Skull Glitch does not work but that is to be expected.

They need to improve the flow of Halo 2 Classic Multiplayer and they could tweak some things with the other games as well.

Now on to the rest of The Master Chief Collection.

Halo Anniversary is a lot smoother than it was on the XBOX 360.

The reason why I am glad that Combat Evolved now has a proper multiplayer again is because it was the game that launched a thousand Halos into space and then activated them and you will find out the rest when you play this amazing package.

Halo 3 is a lot more detailed than it was on the XBOX 360.

Halo 4 looks like it belongs on the XBOX ONE.

Halo 4 out of all of the games was the easiest on Heroic but Halo 2 remained the hardest.

And one update as of June 10, 2015 is that they have added Ranks to Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 4, Team Hardcore, & Team Doubles. Jump into matchmaking to play.",12-28-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,2,They shipped a substandard game counting on massive DLC and patching after the fact,"Been a huge Halo fan ever since the first game convinced me to buy an original XBOX.  A small part of the reason I decided to pass on XBONE at launch was the lack of a playable Halo - just one or the many dumb moves Microsoft has made this go-around.

Picking up an XBONE to play this game has been one of my most regrettable gaming decisions of 2014.  The XBONE itself is a shoddy console - its almost like Microsoft intended to turn XBOX into a software platform and phase out the console hardware and this was just the placeholder until that happened.  But this is a review of the game so that's all I'll say about it.

Firstly I'm unable to enjoy a large portion of the content that was supposed to be part of this game because I don't connect my XBONE to the Internet, ever.  So no LAN play, no Halo Nightfall, and every time I find one of the little easter egg ""terminals"" hidden throughout the newly remastered games I'm greeted with an error message that cheerfully reminds me that this was a rushed and unfinished product when they sent the master copies of the discs to the duplicator, counting on the opportunity to make players download nearly 20GB of data to finish the game.

But that's okay because what I was really looking forward to was playing the remastered versions of the old games.

Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary -
By far the best looking game in the collection - runs at full 1080p and a solid 60fps.  For those of you not aware, this is a remaster of a remaster.  The original game was remastered on the XBOX 360 for the 10th anniversary of Halo in 2013.  This is basically that same game with full HD resolution and 60 frames per second, but the unfortunate decision was made to remove a couple of features making this a lesser release in some ways.  Particularly for reasons that escape me, they removed the ""terminal"" videos and decided to make people download them from XBOX Live, and they removed the stereoscopic 3D mode (a feature I loved and played the entire game in on the 360).

Halo 2: Remastered
This was supposed to be the crown jewel of this collection as the collection's release coincides with the anniversary of Halo 2.  Unfortunately it almost completely fails to live up to expectations.  The only thing massively improved are the cinematic cutscenes which are pretty impressive, but the visual upgrades on the game itself are not as profound so the game and cutscenes clash jarringly.  Despite reportedly spending most of the budget on this game, the ""remaster"" of CE:Anniversary actually looks better and plays smoother.  The Halo 2 re-master noticeably dips below 60fps regularly, and for some reason is not rendered in 1080p making for a softer image with more aliasing.  There was at least one added cutscene that attempts to tie this game in with the upcoming Halo 5, but sadly the same shoddy workmanship was demonstrated in the fact that the video segments that are supposed to display when you interact with ""terminals"" hidden throughout the game are also stuck behind the wall of the XBOX Live and not included on disk.  Just lazy.

Halo 3:
This isn't a remaster, it's pretty much just the original game running at 1080p and 60fps.  It shows it's age but it plays well.

Halo 4:
Similarly to Halo 3, this is just the original game running at 1080p and 60fps.  It almost looks good enough to be a next-gen game itself as the textures and models are considerably higher resolution than its predecessor.  Unfortunately the conversion process seems to have riddled the campaign with bugs.  I've had three game crashing lockups, one of which apparently corrupted a save and cost me about 2 hours of progress.  Again, lazy.",12-27-2014

The other Halo versions are for kiddies that like to run around with machine guns blazing away.

Six months later and Microsoft still haven't fixed it. They took a step backwards, about a month ago, and reduced online play to a max of 2 vs 2, rather than the original option to go up to 4 vs 4. This severely limits balancing of teams (and they haven't bothered to rank players either). Additionally, you only have access to about half of the original levels in CE (no Blood Gulch, Chiron and a few others).

They seem to be listening to heavy gamers on certain websites and are trying to appease them. Unfortunately, that is about .000001% of their market and, pretty soon, they will only have about 50 players left on CE. Then they'll end support of it and wonder why no one wanted to play it.",12-27-2014

However, I give this game 5 stars not only for how everything has been fixed (largely), but also for the depth of content.  4 full games in one, and over 4500 gamerscore to earn, with everything from single player, co-op, mutliplayer (again now fixed) to cross game playlists.  The experience for me has truly been 5 stars.  If this review was written upon receiving the game back on Nov 11, I would probably only give it 4 stars, but if you are looking to purchase a game filled with fun, nostalgia and depth of content, this it the must have game for the xbox one!",12-27-2014

First off the update really sours your experience. The update will take you about at least an hour per game:(
Here is a tip that I used first disconnect your Xbox from the Internet then if the game is in eject it then put it back in while its offline.
Next install the game (still takes a long time). Once it's done installing exit the game then get back online.
Now go into halo and download the update. For me it took about 15 min where it would allow me to get into the game and play halo 1 while it downloads.
I started a stopwatch after a period of time and it took my Xbox on a wireless connection more than 534 min.
Once all that was done the playlists mode took about 45 min to download.
My internet speed is about 10-16mbps

Once it was done installing, the game takes up quite a bit of space on the Xbox one but since it's my only game I'm not too worried about it.

As for the game itself: I have only played a handful of Spartan ops (which is kind of like campaign mini game) and about 4 levels in the first halo. Overall I liked what I played and it did alleviate my frustrations once I killed a few dozen elites. If u can get passed a painful install time and can get the game for a price around 45$ it's definitely worth it.",12-27-2014

I didn't buy this to replay all the campaigns again, I bought this to play online multiplayer on the xbox one.  Well multiplayer doesn't work.  At first when I tried the first few times I kept getting a message to check my privileges before going to multiplayer matchmaking.  To bypass that I had to go to start a custom game then quit, then I was able to get passed the privilege message.  Ok so I got passed that after the second day, I was excited but wait, get ready to wait in matchmaking.  I'm in the lobby searching for players, haven't found a single player as of yet (45 minutes).  Thinking about leaving it on and maybe I'll find a game by the time I wake up tomorrow morning.

Hopefully they can get the matchmaking searching working.  NHL 15 had the same problems with releasing it too early, but they ended up fixing the 5 on 5 multiplayer game.  343 better step up to the plate as well.

Once I got it, though, I was disappointed with how many bugs and glitches were initially present in the multiplayer and Halo Channel. Even after several updates, of which they come randomly (once it interrupted my gameplay and forced me to wait for half an hour before continuing to play), there are still issues. If you are more into the multiplayer experience, I'd wait a little longer before buying this so that maybe the future updates can knock out the problems.

I am a big single player gamer so the online isn't a big deal to me right now. There are so many shooters for online right now that its not a deal breaker.

These game needed skill which is not required anymore. I am still glad this is at least available for this generation. 10 years ago I didn't have the capabilities to play original Xbox Live and get to expierience Halo 1 & 2 unlike Halo 3 before Reach came out in 2010. This is the best collection of games ever ruined by rushing and an unfinished product. The potential is forever gone due to a very bad launch. This was the game to really get Xbones into peoples homes, but no... Just like Battlefield 4, a very pretty house destroyed by a cochroaches. i hope the exterminator comes in and kill them.

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,3,Not a day-one game,"Alright, let me begin by saying that I LOVE Halo, and this is the collection I had been hoping for. Four games and their respective online multiplayers in HD and 60 FPS all for just $60? How could I say no? But, I love the franchise enough to acknowledge that while it is a good game series, it is certainly not worth the hype it was plumped up with. I can take my Halo beer goggles off and pick on the weaker aspects of this game while praising the better ones.

Now, this is NOT a ""Day-one"" game, and this is expected with titles rushed out the door like this, especially before the Holidays. I knew that there were going to be problems the first week it was released, and I saw those negative comments flooding the message boards. Now, I see a lot of people here trashing 343 for dropping the ball here. Now, try to remember who is jerking 343's short leash around with all these harsh deadlines and urgency to rush their product out the door - The Microsoft Corporation. Blaming 343 would be like blaming Rareware for Perfect Dark Zero and Banjo Kazooie - Nuts and Bolts, victims to rushed deadlines and hard pressure from their corporate masters. This game could have been a great launch title for the Xbox One, but instead is an unfortunate victim in Micro$oft's bid to sell this and their $50-off discounted console before the holidays were out. In fact, a recent infoleak on attests that it was in fact M$ that rushed MCC out the door, hence it's glitchy state.

The singleplayer aspects were all remarkable as per usual, but the multiplayer? I'd have more fun pulling my own teeth out than wait hours on end just to find a game. When the MP did work, it was a blast from the past for the most part, but even that wasn't without problems, what with the framerate drops and deplorable lag you'd get from time to time, you'd be lucky if you weren't outright dropped from the f***ing game. Even worse, I was FURIOUS to know that something like this did not get dedicated servers. The first few weeks of this were DREADFUL, and even worse, it was the ONLY reason I got my Xbox, and my frustration boiled to where I was a hair's length away from selling my Xbox One back to GameStop and get my money back and maybe get a Playstation 4 instead.

A month or so later, when the patches arrived, this made the multiplayer a LOT less frustrating, and I may be sitting for a few minutes or less before I get paired up with players. Otherwise, it takes me right back to the good old days.

The Multiplayer is what everyone got it for, I am certain, so I'll talk about it. Halo 2 and Halo 2 Anniversary have their own individual games and matches, so Halo 2 classic wasn't replaced. Unfortunately, Halo 2 Anniversary only got six or seven remade maps, which is lame. I was happy to know that Halo 1 got it's own multiplayer too, however it never got the anniversary treatment like it's campaign did, but you are quick to overlook that when the nostalgia settles in. Halo1 and Halo 2 Classic both got exclusives from the PC versions, namely levels, weapons and vehicles. Halo 3 and Halo 4 have their own multiplayer as well, and it's the same as before in their own separate, standalone titles. However, customization is limited to just armor sets rather than individually customizing each part, like, you want the CQB armor? You get the chest, shoulder and helmet in one set, ect.

Halo 2 Anniversary is the big selling point for the game, so I'll go off and say that Halo 2 Anniversary was well done, Certain Affinity and 343 put their hearts into re-envisioning everything in the game, it looks and sounds beautiful. Even better, that you can instantaneously switch between the old graphics, music and sound with the new ones, even though some of the music tracks are... Unpleasantly different, like ""Follow"" and ""Blow me away"" aren't in the anniversary mode, like they couldn't get the rights for it, but still have the originals in the classic mode? This confuses me.

Even better; unlike the original game, (which was meant to have it, but got left out at the last minute, sadly) campaign has online coop, you and another buddy can tackle the covenant together, or mess around and search the levels for glitches and other fun easter eggs leftover from the old days (namely, the Scarab gun on Metropolis).

At face value, it's a three out of five, it would have maybe been a four or four and a half out of five had the glitches and server problems been hammered out before the release. Sure, the patches fixed a lot of the problems, but M$ fails to realize that first impressions count, and it can be costly, I mean for God's sake, I was so close to trading my Xbox in for a PS4 the online issues annoyed me so bad.

Bottom line; good game, now that the patches are here, but if you plan on getting it, I'd say wait until after the holidays, you can already tell that a game like this will go down in price within a few months.",12-19-2014

Haven't tried multi player yet so who knows how the bug fix is going.  The only issue I've encountered is the game hasn't saved all the levels that I've played co-op in, so I'll just have to replay them!  So far what has worked is saving the game and exiting after each level, the game seems to save the levels played that way, but playing straight through hasn't worked.

They say they're going to fix it, but we're a month into the game's life and it is only slightly more usable. Do yourself a favor and skip this and all future Halos, because it's clear 343 does not care about making a proper game, but only about making money.

Here's a few issues from launch that still persist:

-REALLY LONG matchmaking. In some cases I've waited more than ten minutes for a match.
-Uneven teams. This has improved, but today alone I've gotten three matches in SWAT that were 4v2.
-Missing playlists. no Halo 1 playlist
-Gun sounds do not play properly in Halo 2 Anniversary or Halo 4. sometimes when you shoot the gun will be silent
- You cannot currently stay in the same lobby with players from the previous game, you all get booted back to the find game menu.
-Splitting up parties. The game will split up parties on Xbox Live or even on the same console (splitscreen) and put them on different teams.
-Matchmade games start incorrectly: Several documented cases have occurred where players would search for a ranked Halo 2 game and end up in Forge mode. Laughable.
-Crashing. The game will crash to dashboard incredibly frequently.

At this point, we're a month into the game's lifecycle with negligible improvement over launch day. Skip this game. please. Don't buy Halo 5 either. It's clear that the quality we knew from previous Halo games has been overrun with corporate greed. Let Halo die. 343 doesn't deserve the money.",12-12-2014

I've been a Halo fan since the release on XBox.

Playing Masterchief Collection last night with a friend, it took nearly an hour to play multiplayer. This seems to be pretty typical. The party system was bugged, and we couldn't join each other. After we got that resolved it froze on 'Searching for Players' for 10+ minutes. The only way to fix that was to force quit at the dashboard, and reform our group. Rinse and repeat this a few times, and we finally get in and it disconnected us and everybody else who was playing. It also put some of the other players in our party for some reason? We had to disband, and restart again.

I will say that Halo 4 runs incredibly better on the XBox One than it did on the XBox 360, and I'm sure all of the campaigns are functional. I however would not recommend the game to anyone that wants it for multiplayer.

As you play through, the graphics in 1 and 2 are beautiful, as well as 4 (even though techincally the remastered graphics of 2 are now better than 4's, I prefer the graphics in 4 the most) and then there is 3...On a straight play through if you continue through the games, you may find Halo 3 from a graphical stand point to be left behind, given that it has a major drop out as it has not received the HD graphic overhaul the first two have had. Other than that you can play solo/co-op on all missions, and ALL skulls are available for use out of the box. Additionally, terminals are now hidden and available for achievements in all 4 games and skulls are hidden for achievements in the first three games. Guaranteed the nostalgia and butterflies you will re-experience as you go through the iconic moments in the early Halo games will be worth the money alone.

Additionally you will get access to the Halo 5 multiplayer beta from Dec 29-Jan 18th, which I am definitely looking forward to. You also get free access to watch Halo Nightfall, which is still be released progressively. It details the journey of Agent Locke who will be a major hitter and likely playable character in next year's Halo 5: Guardians. It is very well done from the episodes I have watched thus far, a better series in my opinion than Forward unto Dawn was.

Lastly, you get the multiplayer. Despite what many of complained, and complained...and complained about, they are fixing the online play. Since getting the game on Black Friday, I have had only one problem getting into an online match, and that was before the last 3 updates which have majorly improved play. Now I don't have to wait anymore than I do for Halo matches back on the 360. Many of the maps are either true to their original forms in 1-4, or they have been updated and modernized. Its a real throwback getting to play some of the maps, like Lockdown, from Halo 2 any old fan will instantly feel at home in. Currently the only ranked matches are Halo 2, but they are updating every few days.

The controls now, are a major learning curve, at least as I found. I still have a hard time remembering that I can't just sprint in 1-3, lol, often resulting in death. They do have a controller setting, I forget the name off hand, that you can set so that the controls remain the same through all 4 games, which makes it vastly easier, given that until 3 you won't have any useable items like the pop-up shields or grav-lifts, and you won't have armor abilities until you play on 4 (which I believe means you won't use X or left bumper till 3 or 4). Makes for more smooth game transition and only a quick glance at what game you are playing, depending on the play list.

If you are worried, the campaign alone is worth it, but if you are only in it for the multiplayer, it is far to difficult to tell if it will work for you specifically.

Lastly, the game does require 90gb, at least for the digital download version, I'm not sure about the disc version. It took me forever to download the entire game (most of 2 days and based on my download speed, it shouldn't have actually taken more than 1.5 hours...). So be sure you have good internet and time on hand before you play. The multiplayer will also have 4+ updates you will now need before even jumping online, though they might all be combined for first timers now.

See you online!",12-07-2014

PROS:
- Halo 2 Anniversary. Yay! It's awesome. The switching back and forth between new/old graphics is awesome
- awesome number of mulitplayer maps (but see CONS below)
- the sheer volume of content makes this an awesome value akin to Valve's Orangebox release years ago
- awesome story-playlists to play through across campaigns
- achievements and career stats that track across all campaigns (but see CONS below)

CONS
- there are possibly too many bugs to mention
- bug fixes are breaking other things
- matchmaking is broken
- some achievements don't unlock, some unlock without you doing anything
- Halo2 progress didn't save for me while playing on legendary which is rage inducing
- the TV miniseries thing is deplorably bad. you will not care about any of these characters. it's not about Master Chief, so why even list it on the ""Master Chief Collection""
- career stats listed in your game, online at xboxlive and on halo waypoint aren't consistent. it'll say you've done something in one place and in another place it'll say you haven't done it. broken.
- the terminal / halo channel on xbox one is completely broken. sometimes you'll go to a terminal and it'll access the channel and play something. sometimes (about half the time or more for me) it'll just go black and play nothing
- sometimes save/quit gets you a game freeze and sometimes it'll appear to work but won't save anything (YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE YOU COMPLETE A LEVEL TO ENSURE YOU DON'T LOSE PROGRESS!)
- ""untracked build won't upload"" error. This is the weirdest glitch I've seen all year. It just randomly appeared while going through Halo 4.
- due to all these (and other) glitches above, I've had to both soft and hard reset the game and console multiple times. is that good for the console?
- there are other general glitches you see like you see in other games (like clipping issues).
- other things I've forgotten (seriously, there are so many)

I can't believe there are people attempting LASO (Legendary All Skulls On), getting through it, and not being rewarded for it because of bugs. That is mega-lame.

Great memories of all of them - playing online and splitscreen at friends' houses. However, this is an insult to those memories. This is the most broken garbage excuse for a game I've ever seen. I don't know if most of the work on this got sidelined or fast-tracked or what, but it's just an incomplete mess and there's no excuse for that. I think the development team mostly focused on the remakes of the Halo 2 campaign and a few Multiplayer maps, but everything else is just thrown in there like so much trash.

The only good part of this collection are the reworked Halo 2 Campaign cinematics, but you can probably just watch those on YouTube. The redone sound effects for Halo 2 anniversary are super annoying - everything has this awful upper-end high treble kick and it just grates on your nerves so much after awhile that you don't even want to fire guns. The other campaigns are left alone, but you can't even play them in Co-Op because of the ridiculous lag - absolutely unplayable.

The multiplayer is an absolute mess as well - even with the newest patches. It's a miserable mess that's not even fun to play once you get into a game. And finally, the DESIGN of the menus and general UI is some of the ugliest modern video game design I've ever seen. Some boxes are too small and don't make an impact, everything it just plain and underworked...it's just flat-out ugly and buggy and awful.

When Multiplayer works it is very very fun. (See cons for what I mean by this.)

Cons: The game has a tendency to lag, disconnect, and often freeze your console, its near impossible to play with your friends online at this present moment. Hit detection seems to be a little off.

Sadly this collection is a complete failure and in my eyes 343i has proven they simply cannot handle developing this amazing franchise. I thought they learned from the community backlash with Halo 4 but oh boy was I wrong. The multiplayer is barely functional and its been a WHOLE month since the game was released. My Campaign progress has been reset more than once and I was finally able to finish Halo CE on legendary but it never gave me the achievement for it! Another huge problem is there is no custom game sharing this was huge in Halo 3 and for them to not include it is ridiculous. What bugs me about the custom game sharing is it was a huge issue in Halo 4 and they seem to not have listened to the community that was begging for a functional sharing system.  This is honestly the worst experience I've had with a video game ever and honestly I've given up on 343i completely I will not be buying Halo 5 or any other Halo developed by 343i unless they somehow figure out how to compensate their customers who have had to deal with such a terrible experience they are practically ruining this beloved gaming franchise.,12-03-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,1,I really wanted to like this game but it has been disappointing,"This game was the reason I bought my Xbox One (to go with my PS4 that I've had since launch). It's now the reason I'm selling the console back. For some background, When I was 12-13 years old I played Halo: CE and here and there played Halo 2 with friends that owned the game. I spent maybe 15-20 hours on the original Halo games included in the MCC. Also, I did play the s*** out of Halo: Reach and it remains one of my favorite games to date. I had high expectations for the MCC because of Reach and have been severely disappointed.

As of 12/1/14:

* Multiplayer is screwed up. I've been able to get into 4 matches. One was 5v2, one 2v0, one 1v0. The last was actually 8v8 and it was fun, but I don't think I'd be playing it much. The red vs blue gives a very old vibe that is fairly boring.

* Graphics look good compared to the original games, but I expected a lot more. Compared to newer great looking games like Destiny, Assassins Creed (Black Flag... haven't tried Unity), and even The Last of Us, Halo graphics are kinda pathetic.

* Texturing... ugh. I've never thought I cared much about texturing until I played this game. Halo MCC looks sparse and bland, especially CE and 2.

* This might be a little controversial to some of you, but I do not care for the campaigns. Halo: Reach's story was absolutely amazing and I was totally engrossed in the probably 12 times I played through it. I feel almost bored going through CE, 2, 3, and 4 missions. Out of them all, I'm enjoying 2 and 3 the most.

* Playing with friends can be a frustrating experience when connecting with one another. Some kinks need to be worked out where if the party leader leaves a mission (or a multiplayer lobby), the rest of the group should too. There are lots of little problems like that. Also, it takes a long time for the friends list to even load and sometimes friends that I'm chatting with in a party (and are in game) do not appear on the list.

* I am not happy with the control setups available to me. I've been playing a good bit of Destiny and BF4, and going to Halo controls has been an annoying experience. I'd very much like to be able to assign my own controls how I like them if popular layouts aren't offered.

* Actual gunplay is frustrating. I like having a very precise reticle so I know exactly what I'm shooting at (mostly for headshots) and the reticles in Halo MCC aren't fulfilling. Other games, I usually kill with headshots 70% of the time in multiplayer and 80-90% in single player/coop. In Halo, single player/coop is probably around 20%.

I'm usually a skeptic so spending $60 on all this amazing content that was being advertised was pretty out-of-character and it should have been a red flag. I'll not make that mistake again. I will say that if you are a big fan of Halo, you'll probably eat this game up and love it. But for those of you who don't have an attachment to previous Halo games and are looking for current-gen quality, don't get your hopes up. If they fix the problems and the price goes down to $30ish, you should buy this game. But this game alone should not affect your decision between X1 and PS4.",12-01-2014

-----------------------------------------
Original review:

I love Halo, but this game needs A LOT of work. It hardly worked when it came out, and each update seems to break it even more for me. Multiplayer? I have had so many troubles getting into games that I don't even bother with it. I have an open NAT, so that should be no problem.

On release day, one of my friends who has never had the pleasure of playing Halo:CE, Halo 2 campaign, or Halo 4 wanted to just start with CE and beat every single player all the way through Halo 4. I was all excited for it. I had done the digital order from the Microsoft Store, and mine took another hour or so to do the 15GB day one patch. He purchased his copy at a brick and mortar retailer. It took him 5 hours to install his game and get the patch done(he is on a 60mbps internet connection). I know several other people that have had the same issue. That is inexcusable.

After he finally managed to get it installed, we decided to start playing the Halo:CE campaign. I was the host, and he joined me. I started the game. He got disconnected from the game. We both have open NATs, so we can't see that being any problem. We decided to try again. This time, it worked...for 2 missions. After the second mission, we got disconnected again. Now, I understand this is on release night, and there may be some minor issues, so I was okay with it.

Fast forward a couple days. An update is released. After the update, we expect some of the issues to be gone. HAHAHAHA! How wrong could we be? Now, it took us 4 tries to get a game going. To be fair, after we got the game going, we were able to play all the way to the end of the game without being disconnected. As soon as we beat it, he was disconnected(and didn't get the achievement for beating it). We tried the last level again...same thing when we beat it.

Fast forward a few more days. Now it is taking us anywhere between 7 and 10 tries to connect to each other. It is getting worse before it is getting better.

I am EXTREMELY disappointed in this game. I gave it 3 stars because the game DOES have a functional single player and it is beautiful to play. I just keep hoping it will get better and not be garbage for multiplayer.",11-28-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,4,"Play Campaign Now, MP kind of works - Buy it","I highly recommend this game if you loved the Halo Campaign want to relive the adventures of Master Chief and friends. Now, there are problems with matchmaking, but they are temporary and won't hold you back from the Campaign.  I was able to find and join MP games without any problems at all, but since I'm new to MP, I'm not very demanding.

The sounds and graphics are great, the ability to switch between the original view and the remaster view is impressive, and even though I'm only one Halo CE for the replay, I already feel like I've gotten my money's worth.

But there are some issues besides Matchmaking. With co-op, I've read people do not always get credit for their achievements. For single play, I'm having trouble with the control scheme. It's not really a problem with the game, it's that I've gotten used to a fairly standard layout for shooters, and Halo has me throwing grenades when I mean to aim down sights. It has me turn on the flashlight when I mean to run, and so on.

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,4,Fun but nothing too amazing,"As a lifelong Halo fan, this is what I think of the Master Chief Collection...

Multiplayer has been having problems but should be fixed now so I'm not going to talk about that as all the reviews complain about it.

As for single player, the first two Halo games have been remastered and it's definitely cool to see them with new graphics. I also love that you can press a button and instantly switch to original graphics. It's amazing to see the difference.

What I don't like about the updated graphics is that they basically just upped the brightness and added tons of new lights to make the graphics look better. They did a great job but some of the more dark/creepy areas are now bright with random lights, taking away from the unknown and making it boring. What used to be a drop off into the infinite darkness is now a drop off into a well lit up hole.

What I really hate is there is no theater mode for campaign. On Halo 3 and 4 you could record video and take screenshots on campaign. Say bye to that. Apparently there is limited theater mode for select multiplayer game types. This is sad because going into theater and watching a game from a 3rd person perspective or even the enemy's perspective was a lot of fun on Halo 3.

Beware this does not include ODST or Reach which are two of my favorites. Halo 3 and 4 have not been remastered.

I would still recommend buying this for the updated graphics on the first two Halos. And the multiplayer is fun, especially playing old Halo 2 maps. You can play those in the original graphics or remastered.

I guess I just had my expectations too high for this. I still like it as a loyal Halo fan though.",11-27-2014

Great for halo veterans and fans,"Would be 5 stars, but before anyone buys this, note the ridiculous bugs in the matchmaking system. In their current state, matchmaking system is severely crippled; only 2 games types or one (halo 2 anniversary seem to work) other than that, you either wait an eternity or forever never getting into a game.

Coop/Campaign is stellar, you can't go wrong with this if you used to play the old halo's or want to experience the old halo's in full HD 60fps.

Overall would be a perfect package if microsoft and the gaming industry in general F@%!ing released their games in a finished state instead of arriving before holiday season in whatever level of competition it happens to be in.

Hopefully microsoft and 343 will repair this games multiplayer which is what Halo was mostly known for before people give up on it altogether. Quite frankly an embarrassing ordeal for a game that already worked flawlessly on the xbox 360 and original xbox. 10-14 years later they can't do on a super amped console what their predecessors did 10 years ago without the ability to patch BS mistakes.

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,1,The Master Cheat Collection . . . Better But Still Broken as of 2/20/15,"Welcome to the year of broken launches. Sadly, this game takes your $60 and then won't actually allow you into a lobby to play multiplayer with your friends. My daughter waited feverishly for this game since the day it was announced. We got it, patched and installed it, and then tried to play on line. And waited. And waited. And waited . . .

I felt pretty bad watching her excitement and anticipation turn to dread. On average, she waits about 30 minutes for match-making to work and a game to start. She plays, the match ends, and then she waits another 30 minutes. This makes the botched EA launch of BF 4 look like a perfectly designed Swiss watch by comparison.

As of yesterday, when 343 officially apologized, the estimate for another patch was still several weeks away. Don't get your hopes up, because the last patch that was supposed to fix the game only crippled it further. 343 can claim ""unexpected issues"" all they want, but we all know there is no excuse for this kind of launch but apathy, cost-cutting, and zero quality control. Anticipated profits  and holiday sales numbers clearly ruled the day when the decision was made to release an unfinished product. What a shame.

UPDATE 12/13/14

Better connectivity but some player lists (e.g., Halo 4) remain removed from multiplayer. So, still not getting what I paid for . . .

UPDATE 2/20/15

Still doesn't work as intended, and yet another massive multiplayer patch is planned in the future. And still no explanation for how this game was launched in this condition in the fist place. My daughter has basically given up and doesn't even try playing it anymore.",11-26-2014

I have given up on this game. Matchmaking can now most of the time find a match but its always laggy. It started out with halo 2 classic being laggy but now halo 3 and halo 2 anniversary playlists are laggy as well. I've chosen to give up on this game mainly to not support 343. Halo is still my favorite game but 343 has ruined it and I choose to not support them... I mean they released an unfinished game full of glitches.

I traded my ps4 in for the Xbox just to play halo the way it was advertised during xboxs e3. I will be trading my xboz in tomorrow to go back to my ps4.

If I ever need my halo fix I'll just buy an Xbox 360 and play halo 3 there.

Extremely frustrated here. I traded in my PS4 with 6 games for the Xbox One with Halo and it has been awful. The Xbox itself is great but the game is awful. The multiplayer is horrible. It has not been working since its launch and now, after countless updates, I can get into a multiplayer match but it takes 5-15 minutes. I don't recommend anyone buying this game (yet) if you're wanting it only for the multiplayer. I would wait a month or two before purchasing this incomplete piece of trash.

The fanboys are covering for a game that has been all but completely broken since release. There some good points but way too many negative points to even think about a three star review at this point. I took my review down to see if they would have this fixed by christmas. Well, that has not happened and the game is still buggy, slow, and has too many problems for it to get anything but one or two stars. Other games have been fixing their mistakes and this one seems like it just cannot get there in time for anything to matter.

This is M's flagship franchise. The reviews all praised it to high heaven despite it being near-broken. That was step one in the problem. No pro reviewer worth their salt ever mentioned how buggy this game was. And you think people are not getting paid to shill on this release? Or in the least they are sent out their own game which they play with fellow reviewers and no one else.... those are the only two options.

Single player still has tons of glitches. Halo 2 is a mess and there was no need to run two engines at once in the game as it isn't even true 1080p ffs. Halo 3 needed a full HD release by itself and instead got some half-assed release that barely looks any different than the 360. There is a huge lack of anisotropic shading to make anything defined in the distance. There are tons of jaggies. I could go on and on.... the biggest problem is the matchmaking which just isn't worth my time. Get Dragon Age or Sunset instead and reward a developer that did their job. Microsoft released this for the Holidays and I am sure they were well aware of its problems. Not acceptable.",11-22-2014

While the campaign is amazing and I would give that a 5 stars hands down, I was looking forward to being able to play Halo 2's multiplayer all over again. Sadly though, matchmaking still doesn't work even after the update that supposedly fixed matchmaking. While writing this review, I've been trying to find a game and it found one but it has been saying connecting session for 15+ minutes now. I've tried other game types and can't find games in those either. Long story short, if you want to play the campaign, go ahead and get it because the campaign is still amazing but if you want it for matchmaking, wait for them yo fix the issues.

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,4,"Lovable, but not Trustworthy","UPDATE, 8/23/2016:
The bottom line:  an excellent re-release that we now know skipped beta testing, and it shows.  Thus far, most bugs appear to be fixed, and my most recent sessions just have strange behavior, like Brutes clipping walls (which makes them briefly invulnerable) and weapons fire occasionally clipping through walls and floors. There were a lot of really bad bugs that would do things like reset your progress and last week I suddenly received a flood of achievements that I'd earned a long time ago..

This is also the only game I've ever owned that waits until you're about 20 minutes into a play session to black the screen and tell you there's an update--and not leave you any option but to apply it and lose your progress.  The fact that this happened more than once just boggles my mind.

I love Halo dearly, but the slew of updates may have put the game in a ""fix one thing, break something else"" mode, so while for now things seem to be working as they should, I'm still not yet confident that it will stay that way.  The sad part is, the Halo Channel might have been an excellent add-on to help while away the downtime, but that's still tremendously buggy (and probably low on the priority list).

The full review:
The Master Chief collection has had a lot of effort put into it:  the graphic overhaul of Halo 2 is amazing, the touchups lent to Halo: Combat Evolved (which you can play regular or Anniversary style) are marvelous, and quite frankly Halo 4 looked so good for the Xbox 360 that it's just nice to see that one ported along with the rest so you can play it on new hardware.  It's a shame that Halo 3 didn't get a facelift because it does look dated alongside its companions, but the gameplay is still just as much fun as you remember.  I've played the entire series many a time in the past, including on PC, and thus far the biggest flaw I've found in the Master Chief Collection's single-player campaign has been hard to really nail down:  the difficulty.  Playing CE on Normal, there's a point in the game where it suddenly becomes as difficult as Legendary, and stays that way to the end.  Playing 2 on Normal seems too easy:  it's as if something has been a bit unbalanced.  Thankfully Halo 3 and 4 seem to be about the same.  Halo 2 had major save game issues that would have you repeating large sections of the game, but for now that appears to be working and it looks downright gorgeous.

Interesting side-note:  my playthrough of Halo CE Anniversary skipped the entire chapter called ""The Library""...but that level is still in there, and I can play it at any time...and I even had the campaign marked as completed despite that level being removed from the main storyline.

We also have a lot of extras here:  the Halo Channel will let you watch episodes of the new live-action TV series.  It lets you view all of the cinematics that were added into Anniversary (and now Halo 2) plus the ones in 3 and 4, including the added terminals that run clips about the backstory....when it works.  Sometimes it goes to a black screen, sometimes it crashes and drops you back to the pause screen, and sometimes it fails to recognize you and won't let you log in...so it's good that you can always just launch the Halo Channel app from the dashboard if that's what you want to do--hopefully the in-game interaction will be fixed one day.

Multiplayer has been gummed up with matchmaking problems.  Or long delays.  Or bugs.  Or dropped matches.  It appears that all problems are fixed (though it can be slow to get things going at times), but it is definitely fun again and the Halo 2 remastered maps are quite beautiful.

If you want a good single-player experience, you'll probably be pretty happy buying The Master Chief Collection now.  There's a lot to offer and despite some eccentricities, it is an enjoyable return to these classic games.

If you're looking for Halo Multiplayer, I found it to be tons of fun and it does appear to be working, ""for now"".  With luck both Multiplayer and Co-op campaign will still remind us of the good old days--or show someone new to Halo why the series has the massive following that it does.

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,3,Great campaign marred by inexcusably poor release.,"This one is tough because I really feel this could be a 5 star game if they had waited to release without all the purported bugs and errors.  The multiplayer and achievement issues are inexcusable.  That being said....  the campaign is amazing.  You can really tell the work they put in updating the first 2 games by switching back and forth between the views.  Halo 2 was redone from the ground up it looks like.

However, I had to take 2 stars away to make a statement against so many developers/publishers releasing games that are not complete.  In the days of the Xbox One and PS2 this was NEVER an issue because there was no way to update games after the fact.  Game makers had an incentive to fix everything before release because once you send it out, you're SOL if its buggy.  Now that there is an avenue to release a freakin 15 GIGABYE update on release day... I can't even... I just can't even.  Anyway, this is a good game if sh! t gets fixed, but until then, the good campaign is carrying the game from a lower score.",11-18-2014

https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Master-Chief-Collection-Xbox-One/dp/B00KSQHX1K,11,Video Games,Halo: The Master Chief Collection,3.9,3,Don't buy it.............yet,"I own all 4 of the games in this collection and have been a Halo fan since 2002. I've been disappointed by some games but most of the numbered ones I've loved (except 4). That being said, the chance to play them all on the same system with no changes to the gameplay was the reason I bought this. However, 343 has unfortunately put out a product that doesn't work.

I actually haven't played matchmaking, but those problems are well documented by now. I'll restrict my feedback to the campaigns.

Halo CE: Works great. I'm assuming they just ported over the anniversary edition cause there are few problems.
Halo 2: Basically the glitchiest game I've played in a while.
  - I usually play coop with friends and we have to start the game at least 10 times (normally 20) before we finally play. We continually get 'lost connection to host errors.' Once started though it works fine.
  - Playing Halo 2 has the strange tendency to break my xbone. It'll freeze up and I get horizontal streaks running across my tv.
  - Numerous marines sans weapons.
  - AI enemies getting stuck or not acting correctly.
  - One very entertaining but weird glitch when my friend was at one checkpoint and I was at another. So he was seeing one thing, while I was seeing another. Somehow the game got out of sync and we had to stop despite laughing hysterically.

Halo 3, similar connection problems. You spend so much time getting the game to start that its infuriating.
Halo 4, haven't tried it yet.

  -More general problems, the achievements don't always register nor do unlocking random elements of the game.
  -Clear difference between new and old graphics. Use the old and you see where walls are for real, while in the new they sometimes are shown at a different place. Same with other objects. Elites heads in particular seem to be different between the two graphics systems.

Overall, I think it will be a fine game, I just wish 343 had done some more thorough testing. I'll gladly update this review once the game starts to improve. Overall though, if you were excited for the Halo 2 part and matchmaking, I'd wait a bit.",11-17-2014

I still remember going to Best Buy on the launch of the original Halo and staying up the entire night playing through the campaign. I also fondly remember all of the LAN parties that used to get set up between my group of friends. Fortunately, Halo just continued to get better and better as it went on, especially the multi-player. I honestly can't even begin to estimate how many hours I logged on Halo 2 multi-player. It would be a pretty scary figure.

Well, The Master Chief has really come full circle with this release. This title contains the Anniversary Edition of Halo 1, a new remastered HD version of Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 4, Halo: Nightfall (a new digital series), and access to the Halo 5: Guardians Multiplayer Beta. The sheer amount of content here is nothing short of mind numbing. 4 Campaigns, Over 100 multi-player maps, the Halo 5 MP Beta, and the Nightfall digital series. If you were to spend just 10 minutes on each multi-player map, it would take you over 17 hours to play them all. The best part about this release? Its just $59.99. As I stated in the title of this review, I personally consider this to be the single best deal in the entire history of gaming. MS could have easily charged $50-$60, just for the remastered version of Halo 2 and people would have lined up in droves to buy it. I can't think of a single release that beats the Master Chief collection in regards to the sheer amount of content included. It really is just a mind numbing amount of content.

Obviously the main attraction here is the remastered edition of Halo 2. I finished the campaign a couple days back and it was truly amazing. The new cut scenes from Blur Studio are absolutely breathtaking and really add to the story. As with the Anniversary edition of Halo 1, Halo 2 runs 2 independent graphics engines simultaneously so you can switch between the old version and the new version with the press of a button. I really love this effect as it really shows the amount of work that has gone into these remastered versions. The difference at times is nothing short of amazing. The advances we have seen in graphics the last 10+ years is truly astounding. All in all, Halo 2 Remastered doesn't disappoint and in all honesty, is worth the price admission all on its own. And being able to jump right into Halo 3 really gets rid of the disappointment many people had with the cliffhanger ending.

I really don't think I can add anything to Halo 1 and Halo 3 that already hasn't been said before. Both are amazing games. In fact, they are some of the highest rated games of all time. There was mixed consensus with Halo 4 and many people were disappointed with the multi-player aspect of the game. To be perfectly honest, I didn't really play a lot of Halo 4 MP. When Halo 4 launched, I was having one of my busiest working seasons I have ever had and I just didn't have the time to play a lot of MP. I will say that I absolutely loved the single player campaign. In fact, in regards to story, I think Halo 4 was the best title yet and I am anxiously awaiting the release of Halo 5.

Now I understand that there have been some issues in regards to the multi-player component of this game, but I am giving this game a perfect 5 star rating anyways as I understand that these kinds of issues happen. Multi-player gaming is incredibly complex and a LOT of things can and do go wrong on occasion. That is simply the real world. Have you ever seen the Xbox Live Command Center? Is nothing short of INSANE!!! If you can't handle a few small delays while they iron out the MP problems, simply wait a couple weeks before buying MP games like this, or jump into the campaigns for awhile while they are working out the issues. I have no doubt that 343 and MS will work around the clock in getting these issues worked out. At the end of the day, it changes nothing in regards to the overall quality of this release. The MP component of this game will be played years down the road. A few short weeks isn't going to kill anyone.

The bottom line - If your a fan of the Master Chief than this is about as no brainer as no brainers get. The sheer amount of content in this release is nothing short of mind blowing and the fact that its only $60 is nothing short of incredible. MS could have easily charged $80-90 bucks for this release. Have you even seen the number of achievements? I hate to think how long its going to take people to get to 100%. If your more interested in the MP than single player, simply wait a few weeks before buying it. If anything, that will just give you the opportunity to scope out the best deals on the game. How any fan of Halo can pass this release up is....well, that is simply beyond my comprehension. In regards to overall value, gaming simply doesn't get any better than this.

I am one of those hardcore fans that have been playing since the original Halo: Combat Evolved on Xbox. And this collection feels like it was made just for me.

*What it Includes*
First of all, before release, I was curious what the physical copy included exactly. I wasn't sure if it would be four separate discs, one for each game, or what. It is one disc inside a standard size Xbox One case, and download codes for things like the upcoming Halo 5 multiplayer beta (begins December 29th) and the Halo Nightfall video series. No extra frills or fun stuff, unfortunately, and no special/collector's/legendary/etc edition to dump money into for fellow hardcore fans. Amazon pre-orders also got an exclusive skull download code, but that's not that big of a big deal since in a month or so it will be available to the general public. Just to clarify, you are getting Halo 1 Anniversary (re-release of 2011 Xbox 360 re-release of original Xbox 2001 release, and includes both original and updated graphics), Halo 2 Anniversary (brand new re-release of original Xbox 2004 release, includes both original and updated graphics), and Halo 3 & Halo 4 (both releases in higher 1080p resolution with silky smooth 60 frames per second, textures and polygons are the same as original release though). It does not include the two games which were spin-offs of the Master Chief story: Halo 3: ODST & Halo: Reach.

*Physical vs Digital*
I am glad I purchased the physical version simply for the sake of having a visually complete Halo collection on my shelf with all my other Halo games. I also like the feeling of actually owning something physical that I can lend to a friend or resell (I won't be selling this one though). Being the Halo nerd I am, I also purchased the digital copy, which gives you the benefit of being able to launch it without switching game discs, and that is a legitimate plus.

*Download/Installation*
This thing takes up 60-80GB of your hard drive space. When you run out of space, you'll eventually need to start deleting games, then doing the whole shuffling game. If you delete Halo MCC and want to re-download/install it again, prepare to give up an entire day waiting for that to complete. It takes FOREVER. The Day 1 update alone was around 20GB. Maybe it depends on your region, but my Xbox Live caps at around 10mbps on my very reliable 50mbps connection. Even overnight while sleeping for 8 hours you'll be lucky to be finished by then.

*Experience*
I started playing through the campaign playlist right after the midnight release, and played nearly all day since I was lucky enough to have Veteran's day off of work. It was an incredibly enjoyable and nostalgic experience, though there were a few hiccups along the way. A new feature is campaign playlists, which group various campaign missions into one themed session. There's one for all the boss missions across the four games, for example. I just started a co-op Master Chief Saga playlist, which is every single chronological campaign mission of the four games. We went through Halo 1 without a hitch, but midway through Halo 2 things began to get weird. Achievements stopped unlocking, we had some co-op (XBL, not split-screen) disconnects, trouble re-inviting him back into game, and at one point our co-op game became out of sync, and we weren't in the right spot in the game. It was both hilarious and frustrating. Our movements were still registering across the network, but our character positions were all wrong. I was walking around in a field, but on his screen it was showing me stuck way earlier in the level walking into a wall like an idiot. Dying didn't fix this, so eventually we just quit out and restarted the mission, and that fixed it. But it took about 10 minutes for us to get connected and back in.

I think half of the issues were Xbox Live related (apparently other games experienced difficulties and achievements not working, etc), and half were due to issues with 343 Industry's servers. I do appreciate that within 24 hours they had acknowledged and took full responsibility for the issues, and even had an in-game main menu pop-up acknowledging the complaints and promised speedy fixes. We ended up taking a break at the peak of the issues and resuming the next day, and everything was working much smoother. There are still some bugs they need to iron out, and they have already promised they are working on them, so I guess we'll see what happens, but I'm pretty confident they will be addressed.

*Multiplayer*
Halo has always been my favorite multiplayer experience, which makes this collection nearly perfect. You can select any of the four Halo engines to play multiplayer on, which is amazing. They all have their own quirks and features. I tried each of them, and they each brought me back to a different era of nostalgia. The original Halo was always fun due the skill involved in pistol sniping, as well as the quicker, more responsive, and indestructible vehicles. But additedly, these types of characteristics are also what may be frustrating to those that never played the original. Halo 2 brought us our first online multiplayer and matchmaking, which was truly revolutionary. It also added dual-weilding, the energy sword, noob combo, and an excellent collection of maps. Halo 3 added abilities, armor customization, a bunch of new vehicles, and FORGE (which is usable across all four games in this release)! Halo 4 continued to expand the collection of weapons, vehicles, abilities, maps, and added a whole new race of enemies: Promethians. In Halo MCC, you can select whichever spot along the evolution of Halo multiplayer is most to your liking. In all cases, you can create endless custom maps (Forge) and gametypes (with hundreds of settings & tweaks) which alone give nearly infinite replay value.

*Replay, Value, Replay Value, Bungie, and Destiny*
Speaking of replay value, let me tell you why I think this is the greatest deal currently on Xbox One. As a huge Bungie fan, I was also thrilled for the Xbox One release of Destiny this September. It was fun, and I sank more time in it than I should have, but MAN what an overall disappointment. After the extremely short campaign (done in four hours), all that's left is grinding for materials, grinding for gear/loot, grinding for bounties, and the Vault of Glass raid. That raid is legitimately fun, and a great team experience, but beyond that, there's nothing substantial left to do in the game. Bungie promised the world and delivered Idaho with that game. The Master Chief Collection, on the other hand, delivers at least about 25 hours to get through the campaign once. Then there are 4500 points worth of achievements to collect (by far the highest of any single initial game release). These include revisiting the campaign missions at various difficulties, using various skull combinations, doing a variety of tasks to complete missions in untraditional ways, and discovering a plethora of easter eggs. It's an incredible value. Halo 3 & 4 also expand co-op from 2 players to 4, which is a fantastic standard team size compared to Destiny's general limit of 3 per co-op team (""sorry friend, only room for three here, and you've been voted the lease favorite!""). As far as the story, the Halo saga is captivating, innovative, and even emotional at times. Destiny's was, well, it would be a lie to even claim there is a story there.

Comparing Destiny's PvP (Crucible) to the Halo MCC PvP is an even starker difference in both quality and quantity. Destiny's Crucible offers *no* local, split-screen, or system link multiplayer. System link LAN games were a huge selling point to me for all of the Halo games. I love some good XBL multiplayer, but when you can gather a big group of friends and family into one room, there is no replacement for the in-person energy and smack talk involved in a good LAN game. Destiny also has absolutely *no* custom games. It's just five game types that are all variations of the ""kill people for points"" formula. No CTF, no King of the Hill, just kill people. There is a mode which gives bonus points for controlling spots, but even that mode amounts to getting to a point goal first, and kills give you points in all modes. Destiny has no pure objective types where kills only act as support and don't give points towards winning. It's extremely barebones. When you then compare Halo's gametype library, which is extensive, along with all the possible custom games and maps (MCC's 100+ maps compared to Destiny's NINE), it's really hard to even comprehend that both games cost the same amount. Add Forge custom maps to the mix and Halo is even better of a deal. They always add some really fun and fresh community-created maps to the multiplayer playlists.

*Summary*
Here's what I love about Halo: The Master Chief Collection:
[+] Huge campaign with 2-4 player co-op
[+] Biggest collection of multiplayer maps I've ever seen (over 100)
[+] Includes even Halo PC maps which most have never seen before, many are surprisingly good
[+] Completely remastered visuals for Halo 1 & 2
[+] Upscaled 1080p visuals for Halo 3 & 4
[+] Silky smooth 60fps framerate upgrade from original versions (more on this below)
[+] Custom game types and custom maps with Forge for all four games
[+] Infinite replay value
[+] Some of the best music ever released in a video game (with Halo 2's audio newly remastered as well)
[+] HUGE achievements list to encourage even more different ways to play and goals to work towards
[+] Plethora of customization options for campaign, multiplayer, custom modes, armor/character, etc
[+] Captivating story from beginning to end
[+] Local and system link multiplayer, which seems to be a dying breed this generation
[+] Best value on Xbox One *by far* as far as how much gameplay time you can get for $60

What I don't like:
[-] Some launch day server issues & other bugs
[-] Takes up an ungodly amount of space on your hard drive and takes forever to download/install
[-] Sadly does not include Firefight/Spartan Ops modes (not sure if this will come later)
[-] Framerate sometimes drops during Halo 2A split-screen multiplayer

Other thoughts:
[*] I would LOVE the same treatment with a Halo ODST & Halo Reach bundle and/or DLC. I hope they can make this happen.
[*] Not sure how much support this collection will have with Halo 5 on the horizon. I'm hoping they keep Halo MCC a priority as far as bug fixes and new content. Even after Halo 5 comes out, I will definitely spend a good amount of time switching back to MCC.

*Conclusion*
At the MSRP of $60, I think this is by far the best value right now on the Xbox One. When you think that in a few months it will likely drop to $30-40, it's even more of a no-brainer purchase. 343 Industries has, in my opinion, done a great job and continuing the Halo legacy. When I see what Bungie has accomplished with Destiny (very little), it makes it easy not to feel so bad that they left Halo in the hands of a new company. This collection is the best fan service release I have ever seen, and I am looking forward to years of fresh and fun gameplay to come.

Also nearly all of the customizable feature from halo 3 are gone.  You can choose Spartan or elite, and you can pick a base armor and 2 colors but the original allowed for armor, helmet and 3 colors.

Single player is completely whacked out as well.  First all the controls have to manually be set to play like their originals or you will be playing with the halo 4 control scheme on all games. Not a deal breaker but there are much deeper issues.  The enemy AI is much different than it used to be.  Elites rarely care to find cover instead preferring to charge at you guns blazing.  This is especially true if your shields are low.  Load areas that used to be fixed and allow you to bypass enemies have been changed.  And even the physics of the game just seem a bit off.  All in all this was a huge disappointment.  If all I cared about was single player I might be able to look passed the issues but the huge deal was the revival of halo 2 and 3 mp and in my mind they botched it.  This game was made for the Halo 4 crowd not the old school fans.",11-12-2014

I took the plunge an upgraded to a Xbox One based on the prospect of playing the classic Halo 2 PvP online. My first surprise came in the form of a 15gb ""patch"" that took more than two hours to download. Add to that the fact that the game wasn't delivered until 6pm and I have to say, I will seriously consider ordering my next game digitally so I can download it in advance.
 After a long wait I hopped on to play only to learn I couldn't get a match. After looking online it appears that 343 was unprepared for the lunch of their title and I'm really bummed (I took the day off from work after all).
 I will update my review once the fix the servers but again, I am very disappointed with the game and with my new Xbox One. I'm sure they'll get everything fixed eventually but I don't remember anything like this happening with Bungie (or 343 previously). The game was ""released"" over 40 hours ago and I've only been able to play three matches.",11-12-2014

I hopped on the campaign of Halo 2 right away and boy does it look awesome. The game feels really smooth and fluid due to the higher frame rate, and everything looks better. The cutscenes look awesome also, props to blur studios. I tried some of Halo 1 and it felt way better also.

Like the original but with beautiful graphics, improved maps and an amazing multiplayer experience. The best FPS currently available.

9/03/15 Update: Multiplayer works exceptionally well. They desperately need Halo Reach as well (both multi and campaign to make it the ultimate Halo game. ) I hope they integrate Halo 5 into the MCC so we can seamlessly switch between the different games and do and mix and match. Overall, this is the best game I ever played. I hope they maintain it as I bought my Xbox One just for the MCC. Would also be nice to get rocket race and haunted house zombie games but not too big. If they ever drop support for this game (or the online users drop too much as a result of Microsoft failing to integrate the new games with the MCC), I will drop the Xbox One. Halo 5 was okay and so was Halo 4. Halo 1, 2, 3 & Reach were the best multi games (I was not an ODST fan).",11-11-2014

I have been a Halo fan since Combat Evolved was given to me on my 13th birthday. The remastering of Halo 2 is exceptional, the CE remastering is on there as well and is still good, and Halo 3 & 4 feel and play great. I know matchmaking hasn't been working great on day one, but it will get running smoothly soon I'm sure. Having all the original maps and gameplay mechanics is a great experience for old fans like myself. The new interface that combines all four games is also very easy to navigate and looks good. If you are a fan of this series, get this game. And if you are new to the series, what better way to introduce yourself than to have all four games (one remastered from 2011, one remastered for 2014) and all the original and remastered multiplayer maps?

Graphics:
Amazing.  They are a million times above the originals, and there are even movies added to replace cutscenes that are Hollywood quality.  The games run at 1080p and 60fps which means they are smooth and incredible to play.  it even has a feature to turn the graphics back down to the original quality so you can see just how far it has come.

Gameplay:
All of the original games are top notch, and if you haven't played them yet then you need to get this copy and give it a run.  Four full length games in one package, all of which are enhanced to meet today's standards.

Value:
Four for the price of one.  Each game is amazing in it's own right, and with this you can see just how much halo has changed over the years.  It also comes with the beta for the new game coming out next year.

This is the best value game of the holiday season, and the best thing out on any console.  The games are higher quality than most of what is out on the new consoles with as good of graphics, and the multiplayer features are outstanding.

You won't regret picking this up, whether you are a diehard fan or casual player. Halo is well worth it.",11-11-2014
