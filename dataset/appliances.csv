I ordered it on a Thursday and received it on Friday. The look is fantastic. Despite what others say about the brightness of the lights, I seem to think they are adequate. I haven't been able to use this yet for cooking as my range is backordered, but on the highest speed this baby seems to zoom. For $300 plus the charcoal inserts for $20, you really can't go wrong. Great Buy!",05-21-2012

I got the outdoor model, and it included clear instrucitons to use the two dry wall screws to hang and support the whole range hood.

How ludicrous.  I can tell you where the rangehood would be if a slight wind blew.

I expected a framework to be included for solid install.  Nope.

Also the screws holes for the chimney flue are too large for the bolts they provided.

The range hood might be great -- but who cares if it falls off the wall or the wind blows it down the street.

I wouldn't recommend Z-line.

Finally got it up and running a few weeks ago and it looks great.  Needed a few duct fittings to match our existing ducts, but it was fairly simple.

The hood looks great in our new kitchen and is a focal point.  Was going to buy one locally, but it had bad reviews and cost twice as much as this one.  The local one also didn't have the cool looking blue indicator lights on it.

Highly recommend it.",05-08-2012

Proline series 4 level superior suction!,"4 count them, 4--button levels of air suction! Stainless Steel is not cheap but high grade & heavy thickness. My hood arrived in pristine condition & best packing I have EVER seen, so was well-pleased.

My 30"" version of this unit has 3 removable Stainless Baffle sections which was FREE upgrade from aluminum screening, and the buttons are on the vertical front ledge of unit with a DIGITAL readout screen of the level of chosen suction and even has time-delay on shut-off = BONUS!

-Has a 3-prong plug to plug in and check if working the moment it arrived.
-The exit of the 6"" round flu from motor has a butterfly damper that opens when fan engaged so will be great to prevent back flow from exterior.
-The two piece chimney surrounds are also heavy duty Stainless Steel and uppermost section has two sides consisting of a series of venting to dispel heat at top sides.
-The entire hood and two sections are protected by a clear or blue skin of plastic that is easily removed after installation.
-There is an included small approximately 2""X3"" clear plastic topless box that has slots that slide into brackets under motor housing that is supposed to catch any accumulating grease from motor area low point that is accessed via the removable baffle. This then can be emptied and wiped clean with ease.
-Installation is easily done & straightforward...find the centerpoint of stovetop/range and have center of hood match this point and mark two hanger holes at level into studs with provided heavy gauge screws (rip open wall & install stud if not there--molly screws are NOT going to work here--after all won't be seen anyway as hood covers it).

Con:
-Two halogen lights are in rear of unit and are only 20 Watt each so total 40Watt so woefully dim for cooking surface...I have upper cabinets on both sides so I am installing under cabinet lights on both sides to compensate.

I have not permanently installed totally on wall yet as am doing some extension of wiring in wall behind hood in wall but will update when totally complete with photos. I am using the two baffles on interior two exits of blower motor but I am doing a hollow faux wood beam to cover the metal 6"" flu system across the room to vent through out through bump-out dinette roof.

This hood totally blows away the competition at Lowe's or HomeDepot stores...and the price is at least $100-400 BELOW comps with these features anywhere online.

Recommend this product.",04-08-2012

One like this retailed for around $449 and is special order a most stores and takes about 14 days to arrive.  I ordered the Z Line on Friday and it was was at my door the following Thursday and saved $150 dollars on the product and free shipping.

The product is super well made and very easy to install.  The two hole mount and pigtail make this easier than an under cabinet model to install. I was not a fan of the instruction book but I would take bad instructions over a good product any day.

I would recommend this to everyone who want a high end look to your kitchen at a fraction of the cost.",03-04-2012

Also I was surprised to find out that the vents facing the stove look like the cool commercial style vents that usually cost a lot more.

I am going to do a kitchen remodel in 4 months and I'm getting all my supplies lined up way ahead in case something is wrong or doesn't work right.  I set this hood on my kitchen table and plugged it in to test the noise level(because they don't tell you on the page what the dba/sones are for the product in use).  This is a VERY QUIET MACHINE and the cubic feet per minute(cfm) is excellent.  With 4 speed levels and adjustable lights, they tilt back and forth, this exhaust hood rivals all that I've looked at.

I was hesitant to do so but all of my Amazon experiences have been positive so I figured that they use contractors and installation professionals that have proven to be reliable, properly insured, etc.  I was asked at checkout if this was replacing an existing vent hood or was this a brand new installation requiring duct work to be run.  I chose ""brand new installation"" as my prior over the range microwave was recirculating only, not ducted to the outside.
My install was scheduled for a Friday.  I took the day off work.  As the end of the appointment window drew near and still no contractor, the contractor called to say that they would be late.  She also asked if the crew would have access to the attic.  I explained that I live in a two story house, the ductwork wouldn't be run through the attic, it would have to be vented out the side of the house.  Three hours later she called back to say they would have to reschedule for the next day at 9:00 am.  On Saturday I cancelled two other personal appointments so that I could wait for the contractor.  When they showed up they were very confused that there was no duct.  They called their supervisor, the same woman I had three conversations with already, and put me on the phone with her.  She said that they could not do the work because there was no duct and running a duct required a permit.  I asked her if they could pull a permit on Monday and reschedule and she said no, the homeowner is supposed to get the permit ahead of time and they don't pull permits.  I asked her if I got a permit would they come back and she said no, they don't do permit work. I told her that in all the work I have ever had done to my house, I had never been asked by a contractor to pull my own permit.  We ended the conversation.  I jumped online to my City's website and they don't require a permit.  The website also stated they only issue permits to the contractor performing the work, not to homeowners unless the homeowner was completing the work themselves.  I looked at several neighboring city's websites and they said much the same.  So apparently this contractor doesn't really know what they are talking about or what they are doing.  I assumed that Amazon would have vetted the contractors they use.  I cannot believe that Amazon is letting their brand be tarnished by incompetent contractors.  For all I know this contractor isn't even properly insured.  NEVER NEVER NEVER again will I trust Amazon Home Services and I will tell everyone to steer clear.  I'm currently looking for a contractor and if push comes to shove, I will buy a six inch hole saw and do it myself.",04-01-2017

Well its simple, i just cut the chimney length, the chimney was cut to 6 inches and i still have the proper clearance to the stove as per the manufacture and Zline. I also installed the optional crown molding so your cut on the chimney does not have to be perfect, the molding hides it. I easily installed this myself.

Item has no cracks or dents. Item will come in original packaging. Packaging will be damaged.""  Unfortunately, since the packaging was not damaged, I did not closely inspect the item until it was time for installation in my kitchen.  As it turns out, there were a host of problems including loose parts within the hood (the power transformer, was supposed to be held in place by two screw/nut combos, and was just floating loose), and a big corner dent on the back left corner that I was able to flatten sufficiently to install the item.

The fan is wonderful and quite quiet for the amount of air it moves.  Installation was pretty straightforward, but the instructions are not that helpful.  For instance, the baffles remove by sliding the little knobs backward and the front of the baffle then drops down.  I was fooled because there is a little knob at the front that looks like it unscrews, and there is a handle at the back that looks like something you would pull on.  The manual also describes a ""grease cup"", but it's a rectangular piece of clear plastic that would be overflowing if you stacked five quarters in it - not ""cup"" shaped and certainly doesn't look like it will hold much grease.

Bottom line - if you buy one of these, inspect it very carefully when you receive it.  There was no indication from the box / packaging that this had pretty obviously been dropped on one corner.  I know I learned my lesson.  If you get a good'un, you will have scored a bargain.",10-01-2016

But this is probably the case with all range hoods.

This is a single fan, 760 CFM unit that offers 4 fan speeds, two halogen lights in back, and a timer feature to turn off the fans. A few nice points are that the look is very ""gourmet"" with the vents and handles for the grease traps, the lights tip so that they can be adjusted to point at the food or reflect off the back splash, and the buttons are very simple. It also comes with two nice long, nested pieces of vent shaft for high ceilings.

Here's some tips:
1) you'll need duct tape, and possibly more ducting depending on your application. It comes with a fairly long duct already though.
2) really measure out how tall you're going to position the range hood, keeping in consideration not just the height above the cooktop, but also the vent shaft too. Too low, and there may not be enough shaft. Too tall, and you may not be able to mount the shaft using the predrilled holes.
3) plan out where your outlet will be... the duct and mount on the fan are very close to the back wall, so make sure the outlet / power cord can clear it.

I did find the ceiling mount for the vent shaft to be too short for easy assembly. Unless you're trimming around the shaft, you'll need that bracket all the way up where the wall meets the ceiling, leaving very little room for you to screw in the shaft to the mount.

Finally, the fan speeds are great - lowest setting is still strong, yet quiet; and the max setting is powerful. Fan is mounted in the range well because I didn't experience any vibration.

I did have to re-connect the button controls to the main power connector before operation. It didn't turn on, so I had to troubleshoot the issue - luckily wiring is exposed and not hard to figure out.",07-25-2016

Not sure what it's from or if it's just signs of needing to be cleaned. We don't cook a ton, and when we do, it's usually just eggs. Overall, we've been happy with it. The fan is pretty quiet for being a fan meant to suck up fumes and stuff.... it's not silent, and I wouldn't expect it to be, but it's not louder than I want either.

After seeing mixed reviews I decided to go ahead and purchase it. I had it stored away for a lil over a month while the cabinets and paint work was completed I finally had it installed and I can definitely say I love the way it looks and the upgraded led daylight bulbs that were included looked really nice. Unfortunately my issue is the loudness even just on the first exhaust setting. It sounds loud since the wall where it is mounted on is actually the same division wall for a hallway and you can literally hear the walls shake and a loud roaring echo. I dared trying it on the highest setting and no lie it sounds like an army helicopter is landing on the roof of my home. Wow!! I most definetly would never go past the lowest setting. I purchased some rubber style washers to place them between the wall and back of the range where the screws go in to secure it and just did not do the trick so I guess im out of luck and am going to have to live with it since I have had it stored for that whole month and paid to have it installed.",03-08-2016

Also, we cook almost every day so the grates need to be cleaned on a regular basis. Otherwise grease collects in the grates and then will drip back onto the stovetop below. It's gross. It's incredible hard to clean as well.
That being said, it's not bad for the price. If we were to do it again, we may spend a little more to get a more effective product just because of how much we use our kitchen. If you don't cook as frequently then this oven hood would be a great option.",03-07-2016

Although i had hoped to spend less the price is good - half of what similar models cost elsewhere. Installation was not hard but since our studs did not line up with the mounting holes after using anchors and mounting with existing holes we drilled into studs in other locations - the anchor bolts we used were rated for more than the weight of it but just would rather some part of it is attached through a stud. I did replace the plastic vent with a metal one from home depot because I just preferred not to have plastic in the chimney stack. The lights are very bright and fan works quite well although I have yet to use it on the highest setting. I absolutely love the look and function of it. The entire thing came covered in white plastic so while installing we did not have to worry about scratching it that was a definite plus.

After using it a full year, I am very pleased with it.  It has held up very well and we haven't had one problem with this unit yet.  The light bulb has lasted the entire time without a replacement and we even leave it on at night often.  The fan is VERY powerful when on high and has four speeds.  It sucks up any odors and moisture pronto (vented outside).  The only negative thing I can comment on is that the timer feature is a little difficult to understand.  If I would have read the owners manual a little closer, it would have made it easier.  Installation was very easy although I made two holes inside if the hood to attach it to the wall to make sure it was fully secure (a little peace of mind goes a long way for me!).

Funny story; (tldr - easy enough I ordered it in my sleep) We'd been looking for a range hood for about a month with no real luck. I got an email at 3:30am from Amazon promoting this one on sale. I didn't have my phone on silent so the notification woke me up. I look at it, liked the specs and was trying to figure out if it would ship to Canada. Only way to know for sure is add it to my cart and take it all the way to the last step before hitting submit order. I found out it did and was planning on sending it to my wife to see what she thought in the morning. So I turn my phone on silent and go back to sleep. Wake up at 7:00 and see an order conf email from Amazon in my inbox. Lucky the specs check out and the Mrs like it.

The grease traps work very well, and clean up easily. The lights work well *IF* you are careful not to cut yourself on the sheetmetal when changing bulbs, like I did the first time. (We are trying out LEDs for longer service life, we hope.)

The one minor annoyance (for me) is that I have to push the ""off/on"" button too many times. First push activates a three minute timer, which we never use. Second push actually turns of the fan. Then, there is the third push that activates the fan speed buttons, but doesn't start anything.

""Optional"" cut the plug off and use  a low profile plug.  YOU can get it at home depot as a short extension cord.  I did this because things were a little tight when I wired in the electrical in the wall. 3.) Installing the stack must begin at the top and you should use masking tape to keep it from telescoping back to the bottom.  Also - the screws they give you are about 1/4"" long and are a royal pain to get started... but if you use those longer electrical screws for outlets - you will find the threads are the same and much easier to get started.

It looks awesome, the suction is very good, it's quiet, and the lighting is great.  Initially, I had purchased another range hood with led lights, but they were dim and the color temperature was too cool for illuminating food nicely.  While the halogen bulbs are warm and will have to be replaced at some point in the future, they are very bright, the color temperature is perfect, and I love that they are adjustable.
Installation was a bit tricky since we have masonry walls, and the protective film was difficult to remove from the top of the hood once installed (as another reviewer mentioned).  But now that it's up, it looks great and we are very happy with it.  The seam between the two telescoping duct covers is not terribly noticeable, which I like.  I haven't cooked anything with a lot of smoke yet, but when it's on, you can actually see little particles of dust being sucked up into the hood.
Also, the packaging was very good and there were no dents or scratches when it arrived.  I highly recommend this range hood.",02-13-2015

2. LOW FLOW. Speed one, which is what I am forced to use because it is the only speed quiet enough to hear myself think, is useful only if the pot or pan is in the back of the stove and the steam or smoke is forced to collect under the hood. It won't pull smoke or steam into it from the front of the stove which just barely juts out past the edge of the hood. Speed four is the best at pulling smoke or steam, but really, you can't even talk to anyone else in the kitchen with that amount of noise.

So because there was no accommodation inside the cabinet with an electrical box, our electrician wired an outlet right inside the stack area which made it necessary to route the vent pipe around the plug. Not a clean install. It also prevented me from using rigid steel ducting for the exhaust. So right above the actual outlet for the range hood, the flexible accordion style (plastic - flammable - melt-able)pipe makes a jog around the plug. You think that's going to become a grease trap? I do. That is the only reason I did not give it a 5 star review. The unit functions perfectly and is a very sleek and clean design. I really like its appearance and function.

It would be tough to install this yourself because the hardest part of the installation is running the pipe through the attic and attaching it to a vent in the roof.

It sucks air with much more force than a standard range fan kit. This is great because I was concerned that at this price range I would be getting a professional LOOKING fan, but that did not perform to the same level. My concern has been alleviated-- this thing is great. The true test was frying bacon in a pan, which normally leaves a very strong odor lingering. With the fan running, I could not smell the bacon cooking just a foot away from the stove, and there was no lingering scent afterwards. I did go outside near the vent, and I could smell the bacon odor being pulled outside which is how it should work-- it smelled like i was walking next to a Waffle House.

There are four levels of fan, the highest of which is necessary only for high-heat meat searing and tings like popcorn.

It is slightly weighty, so the installers had to put in stud to mount it.  The convertible feature was greatly appreciated - initially I wanted to put it in recirculate mode in order to facilitate an easy install, but changed my mind mid-construction and went for a vented install.  Good thing this vent hood allowed that option.

Only have it in for two weeks now, but simple things like easily removable baffles and an interior oil catch pan is useful to have.

While install is relatively straight forward, make sure the molex-style electric connectors are tight if you have problems with the lights - installers left one loose and one bulb wasn't working.  Simple and easy adjustment even after the vent hood was mounted to the wall.",09-06-2014

(I did not budget for the extra $100 chimney cover for higher ceilings.)  Someone also left a comment saying it would, so I felt fine ordering it. When my contractor installed it according to the manufacturer's instructions, the chimney hood was two inches short, meaning the pipe underneath is now exposed.  Page 4 of the manual reads, ""THE HOOD SHALL BE NSTALLED AT 28"" MINIMUM to 36"" ABOVE THE COUNTERTOPS.""  My countertops are standard height, and the contractor installed the hood at exactly 28 inches.  When I called to explain the problem, I was sent a short piece of chimney cover, the a half-size duplicate of what I already have and our contractor can't make it work because of the design. I called back and the rep gave me the runaround and told that I misunderstood the manual. And that nobody has ever had this problem before. And that all houses are different, so I should try to understand.

I asked for a longer chimney cover to be sent so that I can install what I paid for, a hood and chimney cover to fit a 9 ft. ceiling,, but they want me to pay $100+ for the longer hood.  I explained that this is a bait-and-switch technique that I am very uncomfortable with.  I asked for an answer by the end of today, and, not surprisingly, they have not returned my call.

The moral of this story:  if you have a nine foot ceiling, know that you may have to pay an extra hundred for this unit to fit it if you install it at 28"".  I now have to pay my subcontractor to take it all down, and install it two inches higher if I decide to keep it. Very aggravating, because now we will be looking at the bottom of the hood rather than the hood itself when we stand in the kitchen.",09-03-2014

We researched for some time before deciding on the ZLine ZLKB36.  We could not have made a better choice.  The vent has a classic and modern look, without any quirky or weird looking design features.  It looks absolutely beautiful, and works like a champ!  It is solidly built, and has the look and feel of quality.  It looks like it cost far more than we spent.  I see that the price has gone up $20 since we bought ours, but I would say that at $100 more it is still worth it.  This unit compares favorably or better than some very expensive range hoods.
We have our vent installed over a 36"" cooktop, and it really sucks--the steam/odors right out of the room.  It is reasonably quiet, even on the highest setting.  Installation was easy, but we had to have a HVAC guy reroute our exhaust because our old one was too close to the kitchen window (our code says at least 3' away from the nearest window).  We ended up running our exhaust line through the roof, which worked out great.
We like everything about our range hood--the look, the price, the beautiful lighting, it works amazingly well, and it is easy to clean.  I especially like the 3 minute timer shut-off feature.  When you are done cooking and your cooktop/pots/pans are still hot, you hit the timer button while you sit down to dinner.  3 minutes later, the vent and lights shut off automatically.

UPDATE 11/2016:  We use our range hood daily, and it continues to work perfectly and look beautiful.  We finally had one of the halogen bulbs burn out.  I noticed that the new models come with LED bulbs, so I ordered an LED replacement.

Also, a tip I learned for cleaning the hood is to use a little vegetable oil on a rag.  This gets all the sticky dust off, and does not leave any streaks like glass or stainless steel cleaners.",08-31-2014

Pros:
Looks awesome. Other brands that look this great start at twice the price.
Moves a huge amount of air! Even on ""1"" I can feel a breeze behind me coming in the open window across the kitchen.
The lights underneath are great - perfect level of brightness, and they can swivel. We often use them as a quieter ""mood"" light when the main kitchen lights are off.
There is an easy 3 minute timer: When the fan is running, the first time the power button is pressed it starts the timer, or press again to turn the power off immediately.
Installation was easy enough, and I was able to DIY it. We added a 2x6 between the wall studs to hold the weight.

Cons: (note we kept this hood in the box for months before installing it so didn't follow up with seller about exchanging it)
2nd rate construction. The back is spot welded, which caused part of the back panel to warp, and one of the welds was broken on arrival. The front of the chimney has a 1 inch scratch on it, which we didn't see until after installing and peeling off the white protective coating.
The right side arrived with a pushed in area... not sure if this was a warp from welding heat, or a dent. At any rate I was able to push it most of the way back to flat from the inside, and it faces the corner of the kitchen so won't be visible unless I point it out.
The hood is off level, or warped somehow. I used a level to mount the hood level to the wall at the back, but the front is not the same level. The front right corner is lower than the other three. I have tried to muscle the front back to level, but that's hard to do once it's installed. I'm worried if I push further it will warp the top of the hood. We've got it close enough, but not perfect.

All in all, we are happy, and we may be able to buff or grind out the scratch somehow. We love the look and performance, and we hope it keeps going for years. If the construction quality was better supervised this would be an amazing value.",08-01-2014

Really disappointed.,"I had an issue receiving one of these vents that was not damaged or defective. I returned three of them back to Amazon before giving up. The way the product is packaged is really shoddy. Each package was also packaged a little differently.

The first one I ordered and received had an electrical problem. The light was randomly turning on and off after it was installed on my wall and the light button was getting stuck, so I returned it for a replacement. The second one I received had a damaged fan blade so when the blower was turned on it made a horrible noise. I sent that one back as well for a replacement (I'm an optimistic person.). I was hoping to receive one that wasn't defective, however I disappointingly received one that was damaged. There was a huge dent in the side. I didn't bother testing it to see if it was defective.

I feel like I've wasted a lot of time and energy with this whole ordeal. I really question the quality of this product even though it looks nice. The price seems a little too good to be true.

I did not install the hood immediately as I am a 64 year old female and could not remove the hood from the box by myself so waited for installation by my HVAC man. When my HVAC man came out to install the hood it, approximately 30 days after it was delivered, the hood would not turn on. Therefore, the call to customer nonservice.  After begging and pleading with the nonservice rep, she agreed to send a new circuit board (which solved the problem.)
There are four levels for the fan.  Any level beyond 2 becomes noisy and 3 and 4 is extremely noisy - noisy so you can't speak without raising your voice.

Great looks.  Nice lights.  Good fan features (auto shutoff).  Easy to install.

Cons:  No power and loud.  The motor sounds as loud as a wet vac, but the max flowrate is nowhere near 760 CFM.  Since there's no regulatory organization that certifies how manufacturers test their airflow claims, it's hard to compare one fan to another based on these specs alone.  This hood is definitely not 760 CFM.  I can't measure it, but it's very similar to an old hood from my old apartment which was pretty basic.  That one would be one of those cheapo models from Home Depot and might be rated around 200 CFM.

It sits over a 36 inch range.  Realistically, a 36 inch hood should probably sit over a smaller range so that the fans encompass the entire range surface.

It is a bit loud even on the lowest setting.  It's not jarringly loud, but it's enough that people will need to speak up when it's on.  On higher settings it really does suck up vapors well.

I know some people thought the illumination from the two lights was not enough, but I found it acceptable.

Hanging the hood was straight forward and I was able to adapt the stack because of a tricky situation not related to the hood.  Looks nice and understated.

Looks good, buttons and display are decent. Halogen lights are nice, they articulate. Material of the hood are good, grease filters on the other hand are very flimsy, easy to bend by hand. In fact one of the grease filter handles arrived bent, I easily bent it back. If you are gentle with them they should last ok. You typically don't wash them with a power washer anyway.

Function:

Fan seems powerful... maybe beacuse its not balanced well. The unit does vibrate a little bit, no one notices but me, I tend to be over critical. I have the hood secured to studs so I was able to get a snug fit. It is loud, unfortunatley that is a subjective. I find it fine because when its in use its only in use for short amount of times. I don't recall the height I mounted it, I'm 5""11 and its mounted so i cannot bump my head on it. At that height it pulls all smoke from searing meats and fumes out of the kitchen on level 2 or 3.

For the price its a winner. Can't speak to reliablity yet.

I cannot imagine how a hood could have been easier to install, it's very powerful, it's quite a bit quieter then I was expecting, it looks good. The only issue we've noticed is the one vent will occasionally have a slight rattle when we're using it, we've isolated it to where we know it's in the little tab that you slide back in order to drop the vent for cleaning. As soon as you put your finger on it it stops so I'm confident either simply tightening it up or using some sort of dampening material under that corner will take care of that.

You should also place blocking behind the fan to attach securely to the wall. Spend a few extra dollars and get quality hardware.

I was happy to get quick answer from Laureen that it should be fine for 9' ceilings and I placed the order.  Item was delivered within 3-4 days.

We just moved into the house and noticed that the lights on the hood did not work, fan worked just fine.  I wasn't sure what to do since I had purchased the product over a month ago - but decided to send an email to the vendor to see if they can provide me with any pointers.  I was really impressed to receive the email from Laureen within minutes telling me she had already put replacement transformer in the mail for me and in the mean time I can check for any loose connections.  My lights are now working fine after replacing the new transformer.  The product looks great and working good for last 2 weeks that we have been using.

Decent reviews on Amazon?  Sold! Are the rest of you reviewers paid by ZLine? Because this is the biggest piece of garbage, waste of money that I have ever invested in. Saying a lot, I know, but read on...

For the price, I did not expect this to be on par with a Ventahood, or even a lower end Broan, but I *did* expect it to function, at least minimally. Word to the wise: you get what you pay for with this one. Had it not been too late to return this item without a hefty $100 shipping fee by the time our kitchen remodel was almost complete and we were ready to install, this would have gone right back. Unfortunately, we found that there is zero useful information on the company website, much less a human to talk to. Just try to find any information on the ZLine website, and you will see that this is a shoddy company---no useful contact info, product info, etc. Cruddy piece of garbage made in China, although the company as listed in Ohio. . The back story, for those who are interested in details:

The product arrived missing a critical piece (back piece for holding the chimney sleeve), but the vendor replaced right away. So far, so good. Then the problems began...

First, one of the halogen bulbs was DOA. After reviewing the cr@ppy installation manual, which listed the page for replacement incorrectly as page 23, but alas, is actually on page 25  (seriously? They can't bother to proofread the instructions?), I set about replacing the bulb. Had I actually attempted to follow the instructions provided (again, on the wrong page) , complete with inaccurate and completely indecipherable instructions and diagram, I would have broken the not only the entire bulb, but its housing assembly. Luckily, I'm fairly handy and not a complete moron (well, except for purchasing this thing:). The holes for the light bulb were honed incorrectly, uneven and nearly impossible to get a bulb in, but after working gently on it for a while, I eventually got it to work. Still, this process took much longer than it should have, and frankly, I should not have been forced to deal with it right out of the gate.

Fast forward to installation a few weeks later: terrible diagrams and instructions, yet again. Our contractor got the main body up with just a few annoying issues. Then, however, the problems started again. Included with the vent hood is a plastic flexible duct piece. Umm, not only is this type of flexible plastic duct not to code just about anywhere in the US, but it is a fire hazard. The manufacturer knows this, of course, as they state to use rigid ducting. So, why include an unsafe and against code component at all? Lack of integrity, I would gather. Off to the big box store to get yet another part for this new piece-o-junk, this time rigid ducting in the correct diameter, and then...

The bar that holds the chimney cover was bent, and would not allow the sleeves to slide in correctly. After an hour of cursing and finagling, contractor and DH evidence to snip the sides of the sleeve to allow fitting. Eventually, it works, sort of. Whatever, we are over it t this point. We figure, pice of junk but now it's done! Turn it on! And!  Ummmm...

At full speed, a defeating roar I might add, this thing does not even cause a piece of paper to flutter directly underneath its vents. Completely and utterly useless. 600 cfm? My @ss.",05-26-2013

Difficult Installation!,"First, this is NOT the Professional Series product ""Pro Series"" as described.  Just look at the instruction manual to see that the product sent is not the Professional Series range hood as identified and described by the manufacturer in this manual.  Amazon is not selling the product it is claiming!  Or Amazon's supplier is not sending the product Amazon is describing!
Second, the directions for installation that come with the range hood are so abbreviated as to be almost worthless.  For example, there is nothing on making the electrical connections, which in my case required drilling holes in the frame and removing the internal power cord connections and reconnecting after reinserting the power cord from the non-plug end - not easy at all!
Next, just try to get the upper support bar located at the ceiling level and insert the screws - any Beta testing would make it obvious that this bar should be located lower on the wall with holes to match in the vented cover section.
Then consider that the provided plastic vent pipe is not designed to fit to standard 6"" metal vent pipe or vent outlets - so it has to be scrapped and replaced with metal pipe which is very difficult to fit to the fan motor outlet.
These are a few of the frustrations I had with this product.
I have a lot of experience with building renovation, and while this vent is attractive and attractively priced, it is unnecessarily difficult to install.  It requires a significant independent learning curve, which I will probably never have to utilize again!

The surface was well protected and had no damage when it arrived, and the grills below are easy to remove for cleaning or changing the filters, but the latches are very sensitive so I think its possible to accidentally bump the latch at the front and have them fall out, but it hasn't happened yet.  My biggest complaint, which the instructions say nothing about, is the fact that you're expected to install an outlet behind the chimney; otherwise, there's no way to easily plug the cord in and get power, and no opening to get the cord out except by running up the chimney.  So you either have to cut a hole (difficult through stainless), run it up the chimney and try to hide it, or make sure you install an outlet behind the chimney first.",03-12-2013

The Euro is a similar product, inexpensive import. The switch panel started falling apart after a year, lighting transformer blew out twice, etc. No replacement parts available - so avoid that brand.

This unit, on the other hand, seems a bit nicer - it's much quieter (yes, you can chat with your spouse while cooking, even on high speed). It attached easily to the existing duct work. Only 2 screws hold it to the wall, and I would definitely worry about using the drywall anchors they supply - I'd think you really want some wood backing behind the drywall (and this thing's big enough that you could likely cut & patch some in, keeping the mess behind the unit and invisible).

It comes with wiring and parts diagrams and a plastic flex tube (I believe code calls for metal in many areas, but metal flex is cheap). It has similar soft-touch buttons to many other hoods and that would be my biggest worry, that those could fail on me again - but the three year warranty is nice.

They answered emails within 24 hours - and it got here in TWO DAYS for free - not bad!

CONS: this uses ""baffle"" style filters vs. the woven stainless you usually find in these things - so I'll be keeping an eye on internal grease buildup. I can't imagine those filter as well, but we'll see.

It should be noted that this unit comes with an outlet plug and therefore can either be plugged in to a previously installed outlet, or hard wired. The unit moves a lot of air and is not quiet at all on high, and moderately quiet on low. the lights are a nice touch and, though located in back, swivel forward to light up the range top.

Pros: looks great, easy to install, moves a lot of air

Cons: Chimney tower installs over range hood flange on top, leaving a small seam that, when using the unit as a ductless blower (with the charcoal filters) air is forced out and forward, right into your face. Of course, its better to vent outside, but until we install the vent, I had to put clear silicone along the seam to stop the air from coming out the front.

NOTE: When ordering the extension chimney for high ceilings, Z-Line replaces one of the 16"" chimneys that comes with the unit (the non-slotted one) with a 36"" piece. This is fine, but it is not clear that they do this and so basically you are paying $100 for 20 inches of stainless steel (36-16= 20)...",02-12-2013

Longevity is important for appliances...so we'll see how she does over the next months/years.  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this hood.  For $300, it is what it is.  It's eye-candy.  Looks incredible and makes a huge statement.  But everything else about it is just kind of ""chincy.""  Not disappointed, as you have to expect that at this price point.  The buttons don't push down very easily/evenly, the wires are dangling loose in the inner fan (some of their 3M tape came loose), some of the baffles fit loosely thus creating a lopsided effect (a gentle bending corrected the situation) the supplied screws/anchors are a joke.  But hey, it looks incredible, and it does it's job...suck's the hot air.  And for that, I'm stoked to spend only $300 on this!  I've posted pictures for you to see....again, it looks awesome.  The packaging job was incredible.  And it comes coated with a protective film that protects the stainless finish until the final reveal.  It is a little hard to peel off the film on the chimney extension unit.  The other reviews said it scratches very easily...so I installed the chimney unit first, then peeled off the coating.  I had to use a razor blade to score it just below the sight-line on one of the chimney extensions for a ""clean break.""  Was a little nervous removing it from the box because some of the protective film had its own scratches.  I was worried those would transfer to the stainless steel.  Thankfully, they did not.  The noise is a non-issue.  It's a fan people...it's going to make noise.  On the highest setting, you need to raise your voice if you're standing directly by the hood trying to have a conversation.  But the other settings did not require my wife and I to ""raise our voices.""  It's fine.  Yes, all of the other reviewers are correct: buy new ductwork.  The supplied plastic ductwork is a joke.  It really is ""easy"" to install in that all you have to do is hang the thing.  Everything else is literally plug and play!

One more thought.  We have a 30"" stove and I naturally was going to buy the 30"" hood.  But right before my purchase, I started doing a little more research and many suggested to purchase a hood larger than your stove, to ensure it covers all of your burners.  So at the last second, I opted for the 36"" hood.  SOOOOO glad I did.  Not only does it look better on the wall, it efficiently ""sucks"" regardless of what is cooking on any of the 4 burners.

Buy it.  It's worth it.  Let's just see how long it lasts......I'm cautiously optimistic.

UPDATE 4/25/2013:  After only our second time cleaning the stainless steel baffle filters, the screw/nut that holds the baffle together stripped, thus rendering it useless.  Obviously, we were pretty disappointed.  I sent an email to customer service asking what the next step of action should be.  They responded that same day with a tracking number and I had a new baffle in 2 days with no cost.  I've never experienced customer service like that.  Really, just outstanding.  I'm still worried that issues like this may arise again, but for the price-point, I have to expect that (one of the same screws on another baffle sits crooked in the baffle, causing it to align poorly).  My wife and I still love this hood...and after this customer service interaction, we're only more pleased with the purchase!",02-07-2013

We completely remodeled our kitchen about 6 months ago, and were shocked to see the ridiculous price tags on hood vents, which are basically just a small electric fan. Not to mention the fact that the big box stores didn't even carry hood vents that would provide enough air flow to remove odors and moisture from your kitchen on even the highest setting! I had my heart set on a nice wall mounted stainless vent with chimney, but was not about to pay over $1000 for something that barely vented. I am an avid cook and purchased a pretty high powered gas range, and needed something to really move air/moisture/heat out of our kitchen. Read the reviews on this one and thought for the money it was worth a shot. Probably one of my favorite appliances in the kitchen besides the new gas range! This vent looks really great, but better yet, will absolutely remove all the cooking odors and moisture out! I loved one review I read about this hood vent ""sucking the hat off your head if you walked by""! It is true! I rarely use any setting other than low-even when boiling huge pots of water with tons of steam! Love that the baffles are removed easily and dishwasher safe. The lights get a bit hotter than I would like, but they light up the back of my stove really nicely for cooking. Some reviewers complained about lighting, but if you do your homework and are remodeling, the key to any kitchen is adding tons of lighting. A hood vent is not designed to light up your kitchen, but this one is perfect for lighting up the back of our stove as that area can be shadowy even with well placed overhead lighting. I would recommend ths vent highly to anyone who does lots of cooking, and wants a great product that will protect their home by actually removing moisture and odors. I do believe you can use this as a recirculating fan, but if you know anything about home building or maintenance, you would never install a recirculating vent that only moves the odors and moisture around your kitchen!

No damage and all parts were intact. Installation is not for the novice in home repair. Ours required adding a brace between studs, some minor drywall work and relocation of an electrical box for power. The installation is straightforward and actually simple but again if there isn't an available cross brace, you will have to add it or contract the additional work. I would not recommend using expandable or drywall screw type mounts because of the weight and eventual vibration so a cross brace or stud mount is recommended. Additionally if you vent to the outside (which we did) you will have to cut a hole in the drywall, push aside any insulation and then provide a vent though the stucco to the outside. Total time doing this myself took about four hours (drywall cutout, stud mount, move electrical box and wiring, repair - texture- paint drywall, cut vent hole and stucco to the outside, install flapper vent and silicone seal it all - not bad for a basic homeowner based modification. Always measure twice and cut once.) Our hood  was an outside vent-type versus the recirculating charcoal filtered type.and the requisite tubing came with the vent.

 Once installed the system worked quite well and the lighting is excellent. It is an excellent compliment to our kitchen and really makes it ""pop.""

It looks pretty neat for the money. I really could not find anything that looks better than this for the money.

I purchased this range hood to replace my current range hood (which is rated at 500CFM) mostly because Z-Line says the range hood is 760CFM in its product description. If that was true, it would be a good deal for the price (I paid $300). But the amount of air this range hood actually pushes out at exhausted vent when running at it max speed is much smaller than my old range hood does. I don't have an air flow meter to get an accurate number, but looking at how much the flap on the vent opens and feeling the air stream blown out when running this range hood at is max v.s. when running my old range hood, I would estimate this range hood is 300CFM max.

Other than that misleading description, this range hood has several other flaws:

- The exhausted pipe come with the range hood is plastic. This is not good. All exhausted pipe for range hood should be rigid steel pipe. It's not a big deal for me as I simply not used it, and used a metal pipe instead.

- The pipe adapter between the hood canopy and the round pipe is also plastic. This caused an headache for me. I couldn't find an steel adapter that fits the range hood from any store. So I had to spend many hours to build an adapter using a piece of 8-in diameter round metal pipe to replace the plastic one on this range hood.

- The design  and build of this range hood makes it's very hard and dangerous to do regular cleaning for the inside:

  + Inside this range hood's canopy, metal edges are not smoothed out. They are extremely sharp. That makes cleaning inside this range hood is a dangerous. I got several cuts on my hands when trying to do that.

  + The edges of baffle filters have the same issue, they are sharp. I plan to give them some sanding job to fix this issue.

  + There are many small chambers inside the range hood canopy. It's practically impossible to have a good cleaning for those chambers. In my experience with range hoods, if not cleaned properly, after using for sometime (years), the cheesy will accumulate enough and start dripping out on things being cooked on the stoves below! I tried to mitigate this with aluminum duct tape (the thing used for heating pipes). Using aluminum duct tape, I could seal/cover most of those chambers so that the cheesy stuff won't get inside them.

  + Many parts, wires inside the range hood canopy are exposed to the air stream the hood tries to suck out. It takes much more time to clean those. They should have been covered, not exposed to the air stream, so that we don't have to clean them.

I'm still using this range hood, not returning it even with all those issues because I damaged my old range hood canopy when taking it out. I need something to fill that old range hood's place! I'm planning to salvage the old blower and throw away this range hood weak blower to 'fix' the capacity issue.",10-28-2012

I shopped all over, and this was half the price or less of competitive products. I just finished installing it today, used it while cooking dinner this evening, and thus far I'm pretty happy with it. I'd say it looks comparable to some of the $1000 range hoods I looked at. I have a few minor nits, but nothing that would make me want to spend twice as much.

The good:
- Nice overall look and material quality. Looks excellent installed.
- The unit itself is easy to install.
- Buttons operate well. LED indicator on the front is nice.
- Lights work well and can be rotated to focus on the cooking surface.
- good fan suction even at low speed.
- Well packaged. The finished surfaces are covered with a cling plastic to protect them from damage. This is nice on the primary unit, more annoying to peal off of the baffles.

Things to be aware of:
- The baffles fit very loosely into the housing and sit a little lop-sided. I'm sure this can be rectified with a little creativity.
- A little louder than I expected, but still ok for having a conversation at the low speed without having to speak up.
- The unit tended to vibrate when hanging on two bolts. I had to put a couple additional screws through the back corners to hold it firmly against the wall to address that.
- Don't bother with the included wall screws and anchors, or the plastic duct. Do yourself a favor and get the right parts for your installation from a hardware store.",10-19-2012

We are in the middle of kitchen remodeling and we had to wait a while until the cabinets were in place in order to install it.

I won't talk about the process of installation because everyone has different needs, for instance, venting issues, re-routing of air pipes, holes in ceiling or wall, etc.

The Hood looks amazing but the most important thing is that it works as intended. It does.

The picture shown on the description is not the same one we got. Ours is all stainless steel with steel baffles. 760 CFM's.  We were able to install it at 32"" from the top of the high power gas stove and it works beautifully without getting in the way. (for those with high BTU gas stoves, do the research for your stove since high BTUs and high CFMs may need extra distance)

We specially enjoy the fact that the hood can be set up to shut itself off after 3 minutes.

It is a bit loud, but not as loud as the piece of junk it replaced with less than 300 CFMs. We have kitchen/family room combo and there is enough noise with TV and kids to make no difference. The main thing is that it contains cooking odors and there is no grease on the side cabinets.

After cooking a dish with cabbage as one of the ingredients, we could all tell how much better this hood was than the one we had before. It did not smell in the bedrooms or hallway.

In short, we love the hood. It looks great. The stainless steel is beautifully polished and is eye candy as well as a great performer.

One thing to remind myself of and leaving it here for those who will find it useful: When cleaning the baffles, remember to remove and wash the capture plastic container.

Okay, how is the service with this company?

If you have to deal with anyone there, you may be pleasantly surprised with the fact that your call is not routed out of the country.  My contact person was Laureen in Ohio and she could not have been more friendly and professional.

The fast responses received from Laureen is reminiscent of times gone by. If you are old enough, you will remember when customer service, professionalism, courtesy, and problem solving, were the golden standard upon which businesses were built. This is most definitely the case here.

Our reason for the contacts is the fact that our ceilings are 10' feet tall. If that is the case for you, ensure that you order the right extensions to fit your needs at the time of placing the order.

We could not be more pleased with the product or the company. We highly recommend them.

In response to someone complaining about the screws: We used our own to install the hood based on the location of our studs and size of holes that had to be drilled. It is not a big problem or a reason to downgrade the quality of the product.

The fan speed varies with the button you push so goes from normal exhaust to wild and crazy exhaust.

Fortunately, it's made of cheap plastic that I can cut to put the register cover back on. It is not sitting on even ground under the drawers (hard wood gives way to subfloor), but it still manages to keep the drawers from warming up without leaking much warm air around the edges.

This greatly adds to the durability, if that is an issue.  If one needs it longer, then purchase another and use the two together.  The material can easily be modified with scissors and/or glue (or tape) to fit custom needs.

Though the material may appear thin and flimsy comparing to the much thicker and harder vents sold in Lowe's or HomeDepot, this vent is just right for its job.  In fact, one could argue that this thinner and flimsier product is much harder to break than Lowe's/HomeDepot because of its flexibility.  I broke a few pieces that I bought from Lowe's and HD in the past.
I also really like the fact that its height is about half of the others which fit snugly underneath my TV console.  Its length is very sufficient to ensure the heat/AC will not be pushed / disappear into the furniture above it. I only need one piece and trimmed off 4"" from its original length.  There is still another piece that can be easily taped together should the extension is under a much deeper couch.
I didn't bother use the included plastic clip because there is only one and if I ever clip it, I'll clip on all 3 sides.
Instead I use the 2-sided 1""-wide tape cut-to-measure so that all 3 sides of the EXTVENT are held firmly to the existing vent.

I decided it was time to change it because the water was flowing out in a trickle.  I then bought this 2 pack in March, and both filters are clearly defective.  Upon initial installation, both produced water at the normal, high flow rate.  Then, the first filter I installed died in just 2 months.  Thinking it was defective, I installed the second one, and it didn't even last one month.  The failure mechanism is: the water flow rate goes from the normal, high flow rate that will fill a 16oz water bottle up in 5-10 seconds, to a trickle where it takes 1-2 minutes to fill up the same bottle.  See the attached video; this is what it looked like when all three of these filters failed.  Thinking it could my refrigerator freezing the filter, I removed the one in the refrigerator and let it sit on my counter over night; after reinstalling it, the flow rate was still a trickle.  My refrigerator isn't the problem; the OEM filters never had this issue.  There's something wrong with this brand of filters.",07-22-2016

The filter door in my Maytag fridge depends on the filter being the proper length to secure it when pushed up into position.  If the filter is too short the filter does not wedge itself into position and consequently rests on the filter door.  The fastening clip on the filter door does not lock firmly enough to secure the EcoAqua filter resting on it.  Consequently I had to fashion a wedge to fit on the end of the EcoAqua filter to secure it when pushed up into position.  I just installed the filter so I have no opinion how well it filters.,12-17-2015

Remove filter and hold filter under warm water. Wound up disposing of the first of the twin pack. Interesting how the second one was fine.

I suspect you want both, to avoid leaking.  I thought the foil seal over the filter opening was a nice touch.

As it stands one week out, I would buy this filter again, but I might choose another seller.

We've had pretty limited freezer space due to constraints in our kitchen.  If we could have a bigger refrigerator/freezer combo we would.  Alas, we can't.  We had thought about buying an additional freezer for our basement, and always thought in terms of a larger one, and really didn't want to go that route.  So I was pleasantly surprised to see several options on Amazon.  After reading all the reviews, I settled on this one, and we couldn't be happier.

We've had this freezer for more than six months now, ahead of the demanding holidays when we always need additional freezer space. What a game changer!  We were surprised by how much this freezer holds, how easy it was to install - just plug it into a ""regular"" socket in our somewhat ""older"" basement, and it was ready to go.  Now we don't know how we ever lived without it and wonder what took us so long.

This unit is also quiet, which - even though it's tucked away - is not a bad thing when we do go downstairs for laundry and other errands.  We're hoping it continues to be as reliable and effective as it is right now, and are so pleased by the great price and the huge difference it's made for us.

After much research and reviews, I found that this is the best freezer I could get. When I got this fridge delivered to me, it was exactly what we were looking for and it fit the kitchen perfectly. We put all our long term storage items in there; including meats, and quick meals.
The freezer worked perfectly for 2 months. The green light on the bottom is on my vicinity and notice when I leave home and come back. Its on button is always a relief. One night, I woke up in the middle of my sleep, went to the kitchen for a glass of water, and what do I see? a green light from the freezer, but blood ALL OVER MY KITCHEN. The next hour went by so fast trying to clean up and trying to figure out what went wrong.
There was no indication that the freezer went bad. I opened the freezer and everything was in room temperature. This means that it was out for couple of days and all my foods are bad now.
Being nice, I requested feed back from Danby (through Amazon support), no response. I had to return this product (I really hate returning) because I had no choice. All of my food went bad including some premium meat I was excitedly waiting for the right time for :P.
Summary to the manufacturer: Please add a fail light on alarm. That way at least I am aware to save my foods. I really don't know how this passed quality assurance.
Summary to consumers: Unreliable freezer; Manufacturer has the right idea, but they need to get a version 2 with 1 more feature.

I thought okay I'll just adjust the hinge pin positioning on the door/freezer. They are fixed in this position- not adjustable. My only option is to add D-profile gasketing to reduce but not eliminate the gap completely. Note also the photo shows a small dent in the door.

Great size and appears good quality.  Arrived very banged up.
I cannot understand the damage as the outer box had rips and damage, so took pictures. Then opened and found it was doubled boxed. I was thrilled as I figured the freezer was protected from any of the outside box damage...but when then next box was opened the freezer was significantly dented on all but one corner edge. The greatest concern was a very bad dent where the compressor is. Amazon the great company they are, was going  to send an immediate replacement, but I was heading out of town and could not wait for a new freezer to arrive.
I called Danby just to be sure the freezer was sounding as it should and decided to keep it and wait to return if need be.
So far so good. Impressed with size. It holds a lot. Also impressed with how quiet it runs.
Only disappointment was the damage in delivery or possibly damage from the factory.",06-26-2017

The second freezer had one big dent on one of the outside corner edges, but it had no other issues and I didn't want to return another, so I let Amazon know and they gave me a decent partial refund. The freezer just needs to be packed better when shipped out. Both came in only cardboard, plastic wrap and foam pieces for only 2 sides of the freezer. It needs to be encased in foam and/or bubble wrap (or something).

As for the freezer's actual performance, the freezer has been plugged in for a few weeks now, and it works quite well.

I plugged it in at the nearest outlet to ensure the system was operating and within 5 minutes, parts of the inside walls were already getting pretty cold.  It's been several hours and it very cold now.  The unit is relatively light and has two wheel casters in back for ease of movement.

The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars?  Upon further inspection, I noticed the drain plug was missing.  I thought it easier and faster just to order one from the Danby's affiliate parts partner... which is true... BUT the $1.89 part is going to cost $7.99 to ship to my home.

I know of only one person in my life that has their freezer in a place other than their garage.  The Frigidaire that I had running next to this Danby unit has been working for 5 years great in the garage.

It is just perfect for my needs!  First of all, it arrived from Amazon right on schedule.  It did not have any dents or scratches on it! I/we did have to reverse the way the door opened on it.  It really helps to have another person to do this with; it wasn't terribly difficult.  It arrived pre-set on the number 4, which seems fine but I am not sure yet as my freezer thermometer has not arrived yet.( I will update later.)  It did seem a little larger then the dimensions mentioned in the advertising however, this wasn't any real problem for me as I was easily able to accommodate it.  I could possibly use a light inside it but it really isn't a necessity.  The only difficulty I have had with this so far, is leaving the door ajar.  Although it closes tightly, you must make certain the door is closed.  It's easy to close the door within an inch or two of the jamb, but it doesn't really ""snap"" shut like other appliances do.  I really do like this freezer.  It is so much easier to use then my new Samsung bottom freezer in which things are always a piled in jumbled mess.",11-05-2016

Sending back for replacement.  2nd being returned also.  Third arrived fine.,"7.2 Cu ft freezer arrived damaged, although the shipping boxes (box within box) did not appear damaged at all.  The bottom metal motor mounting plate was bent up from bottom, the motor and tubing had dented the ""floor"" above it.  Also, the lid was dented where 2 ""protective"" spacers were placed.  The lid had 2 cracks inside where it had pushed down onto the hanging basket.  Shipping boxes appear fine.  Wonder where the damage occurred.  Before it's even packaged at Danby factory?  Strange.  Set up a replacement through amazon. I'll package it up and they will pick it up for free and replacement is already scheduled to arrive in a week.  I will update the review then.  Looking forward to having a non-damaged working freezer!  It looks nice an spacious.

UPDATE: 2nd freezer arrived today. (Fast shipping!)  It has numerous minor scratches and dents. I can deal with that. However the lid does not seal tight along the back. The sides and front are fine, but in the back there is about an eighth inch gap letting out cold air. This is not acceptable as we would be wasting energy constantly and there would be greater frost build up inside. Will be returning for a 3rd replacement. Maybe ""Third times a charm""? Or we could get worse, but I don't think the gap in seal is functional, so I need to return it. Tried sitting on the top and it didn't push it down either, so the lid itself must be bent slightly from who knows. The packaging was fine. Issue prior to packing??

UPDATE #2:  3rd freezer arrived without damage.  Still a small gap in seal on backside of lid.  We lowered/tightened the lid hinge on one side a little bit, and that seemed to take care of it.  It's running quietly, more-so than the 2nd freezer which makes it suspect even more.  Glad I returned it

Things are very safely frozen in this thing.  It also isn't very noisy, though you can tell when the compressor kick in.

One thing to note is that the shelves are not removable (without disconnecting the ""quick freeze"" mechanism, which I'm not sure you can and which I don't think they'd recommend) or adjustable.

Also, keep in mind this is not a freezer for storing items you want to get to regularly (e.g. don't put ice pops in there on a hot summer day and go running in to retrieve one every few minutes).  This is a freezer designed for storing food, not regularly accessing it.  It will frost over quickly if you open and close the door a lot and defrosting it means emptying it and letting the ice melt and cleaning up the water.  It doesn't have a drain.

I would have preferred a chest freezer since it would have been less expensive, easier to defrost, and more efficient, but I needed something for a space that wouldn't allow me to have an open top and this Danby does the trick.  If you can fit a chest freezer in your space and don't have a reason for needing an upright, then get one, but if a chest freezer isn't an option, this is a great choice.

It is very lightweight, and I could easily help my husband lift it up the eight steps to our kitchen door.  There are even two wheels on the back to help move it.  There is also a power indicator light and a drain plug near the bottom.  The inside volume of 7.1 cubic feet is the perfect size for two adults and two teenagers.  It is small enough to fit into the pantry space between our kitchen and dining room, saving me a trip to the basement every time I need something from it.

The start-up instructions in the manual said to run the freezer at its coldest setting for 3-4 hours when we first plugged it in.  It was cold enough after two.  This is a very quiet appliance. I can hardly hear it running!

This freezer has already paid for itself when I consider the money it has saved us.  Shopping and meal planning is no longer limited by the small freezer above the refrigerator.  I buy ingredients in bulk, and this freezer can handle it.  I never have to worry again about bugs ruining a 50 lb bag of flour.  When I buy cases of fresh produce from the farmers market, I can bring it home, wash it, cut it, and freeze it so that it is ready to cook on a busy weeknight.  With all that, I can still prep freezer meals weeks in advance.

To monitor the temperature more closely, I do wish it came with a separate thermometer to clip onto one of the wire baskets inside.  I don't mind buying one, but it would have been a good idea to include one.",06-21-2016

I mean freezing body sized objects,"This freezer is perfect for socking away troublesome meats and veggies that don't know how to pay up on time. If you've tried everything you can think of to get your money out of all your fresh meat and veggies, it might be time to start putting them on ice. And wouldn't you know it, this ice box is perfect size for keeping them from rotting away in a basement and eventually attracting unwanted attention from neighboring meats and veggies! This bad boy can only fit one regular sized meat and/ or veggie. No need to buy a second for witnessing meats and veggies too.

Pros:
-surprisingly deep!
-relatively energy efficient. I have no noticeable increase in utilities since buying this freezer. This also happened to coincide with a roommate moving out though, so make your own assumptions on energy usage.
-can fit one whole person in there, at least. If you were so inclined. Which I'm not.
-gauranteed not to rat you out to the 5-0.
-comes with a basket for bread items!

Cons:
-theoretical body would need to be cut into smaller pieces.
-appliance does not congratulate me after Tetris-ing the hell out of whatever I'm jamming in there. Surprisingly hurtful.

I am super pleased with this item's performance. I'd be inclined to give 5 stars were it not for the temperature control being low to the ground, which caused my immediate death. Still a solid 4 stars.",06-01-2016

I followed the directions which were easy and straight to the point to get this freezer ready. The problem was, it didn't freeze! I had it set to the coldest setting and it didn't freeze at all. Had it plugged in and on at the coldest setting for 3 days and still didn't freeze! It didn't even get that cold. I put a few frozen food items in it and it thawed right inside this freezer. Thinking perhaps it was the outlet, I tried a different outlet, the same outlet my Samsung Fridge is plugged into and it still didn't freeze properly after having it set to the coldest setting for 6 hours.

conveniently located in the front and the inside basket is very helpful in locating items in the freezer.

My refrigerator is 20 years old and the ice machine broke.  So I got this just in time. I hate having to fill and empty ice cube trays.

The ice machine is a little bigger than a bread baking machine and weighs 25 pounds. It has a modern stainless steel body and a black top with a see thru window.

It's so easy to use and came with an instruction manual.  You just plug-in and add water. The machines works on its on.  There is an electronic control panel on the front with LED light indicators.  There are metal rods looks like 9 that create the ice.  The basket holds 2.2 pounds of ice.  The machine let's you know when the water is low or the basket is full with the LED lights.

It is very quiet and the only noise I heard was ice falling in the basket.

When I first started it took about 15 minutes to make about 9 medium pieces of ice.  To be honest I though of my gosh it's gonna take a couple days to fill this ice basket at this rate.  After the first batch of ice it started making ice about every 9 minutes.  I noticed after about 2 hours that the basket was almost full.  We made several baskets of ice that day and have been making lots of ice ever since.

I prefer the larger size ice cubes which are not as big as ice cubes in an ice tray but work good in my diet soda and ice tea glasses.  The small size would be great for slushes in the blender.

I like having the window on top so you can see the ice.  Should I get busy and forget to empty the basket,  the ice just melts back into water in the reservoir.

To change the size of the ice just requires a push of a button for small, medium or large.  There is also a power button to turn on and off.

It has a drain plug to empty unused water since it says to use fresh water every 24 hrs.

This is definitely one of my favorite new kitchen gadgets.  My daughter has already asked to borrow it.

It also has a 12 month warranty which is great.

I did receive this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion.",06-24-2016

Easy to use and works awesome! Seriously!,"I love this ice maker. Omg. I love ice. I put ice in almost every drink. I love ice water. I love chewing on ice. But ice trays suck. So I was super excited to get this. It's very sleek looking too. It's pretty heavy, and has a fan on the side and air holes in the back so you have to keep it away from stuff so it can work properly. When I first got it, it said to let sit for an hour to settle so I did. Then I filled it almost to the line with water and turned it on. I selected medium ice cubes because it said they could possibly stick if you used larger ones. Then let it do its thing. About 10 or so maybe 15 minutes later, I heard ice fall into the tray. I went and looked and was so excited. I had ice!
So when you open the flip top lid, you will see a scoop inside a basket. Lift that out and that's where you put the water. In the back behind the basket were some metal rods. That is what the ice is formed around. I know because I watched it a couple times lol.
When I first got it, I cleaned the inside as directed with a soapy wash cloth then dried it.
The front of it, has a few buttons. One for on/off, and one for selecting the ice cube size. It also has an indicator to let you know when the ice basket is full and when you need more water. How freaking awesome.
I now have 2 huge bowls of ice in my freezer! It makes so much ice. I love it. Now I can have ice anytime I want, for free. I don't have to pay. The ice that I have in my freezer, fills my little cooler perfectly. Yay. We are having a BBQ this weekend and guess who's bringing the ice.
This is probably my most favorite kitchen appliance ever now. I definitely recommend. Very user friendly and easy to set up and use. Great ice too!

Since we first plugged it in, it's been a workhorse and we've had it plugged in and on almost every day. Works exactly as advertised: 3 ice sizes, enough ice for a drink in one cycle (~7 min) and for a big-boy smoothie in two cycles (less than 15 min). You can hear it drop ice into the bucket, but it's not too disruptive where it sits on our downstairs bar just under the kitchen; we leave it on continuously, although we do turn it off when guests are sleeping in the next room (separated by glass doors). Ice isn't overly wet and drippy - it's restaurant quality or better, firm, perfectly formed, and not frozen into a big block. We do need to 'dry' or drain the ice on a paper towel before dumping it into a ziploc bag if we want to transfer to the freezer or it'll clump up, but it's not a big nuisance and we typically just leave it in the machine to melt/refreeze for fresh cubes. For it's performance it's a solid four stars - could be quieter, could make more per cycle, could store better, but overall great. ThinkGizmos customer service pushes this to a firm five stars, though: Yesterday our ice maker went out - no explanation, no warning, just woke up and no ice for smoothies; played with it most of the day and got nowhere so I emailed customer service through amazon. By this morning they had emailed me back offering to send a replacement and apologizing for the inconvenience. We're a little out of the warranty window so I emailed figuring maybe they could advise on repair and am truly impressed by their level of service and responsiveness. Items break down, especially after warranty windows, and especially with ultra-heavy daily use. I get that. And apparently so does ThinkGizmos.

It may very well make 20 pounds of ice in 24 hours, but you will have to empty it EVERY time it makes its 10 ice cubes and get them in your freezer immediately. So, plan on a full day before your party to sit with your ice maker. The ice it made was ok, but it begins melting immediately after it drops.

Let me begin by saying that if you don't use more than 4-6 standard size trays of ice /day then this machine is probably not worth it for you. No ice-machine I've seen is even a close 2nd to the ice-makers that are available in most refrigerators these days in as far as production, ease of use, convenience and quality of ice so if you have the option of purchasing or using a refrigerator with an ice-maker by all means take that option. This ice machine definitely has a learning curve and is not as turn-key as I thought, however, there are a few simple tricks you can do that will enhance it's performance and output. I would have given it 4 stars for its performance but I found the output in the description some-what deceiving. Another consideration that you will have to make is the counter space that the machine takes up.

OPERATION:
The machine produces the 1st batch of 9 bullet shaped cubes (which are 1/2+ the volume of traditional cubes) in about 6 minutes as described but succeeding batches take considerably longer. It takes from 3 to 3.5 hours to fill the hopper which is 9.5""x 5""x 4.5"". The description states that the machines produces 26 lbs./day but that's if you operate it for 24 hours. When the ice comes out it is wet and it will stick together after it is put into the freezer the same as the bags of ice you buy from Walmart, C-stores, etc. The difference is that ice from these locations is made from tap water and could possibly have sanitary issues depending on how it was bagged. This machine gives you the control of sanitary handling and the option of using spring or purified water.

A few operating tips to enhance performance:
1.) When the hopper fills up, the full ice indicator light comes on and halts machine operation even after the hopper is emptied until the sensor warms up. If you desire the machine to keep operating, cover the sensor (a metal rod on the right side of the hopper) with the ice scoop, handle pointing up. If you forget, hold the sensor between your fingers until it warms up and the red indicator light goes off.
2.) Put some left over ice into the reservoir to speed up the process.
3.) Store the ice in a small bucket/container lined with a bag, that way you can pull the bag out and bang it on the counter if the cubes freeze together and then easily put them back in the bucket.

I hope this review will help you to make an informed decision about whether or not this machine is right for you.",08-06-2017

It fits in well with all our other stainless steel appliances, and sits on the wet bar nicely, without taking up too much room.  I almost took off a star because the otherwise handy plastic ice scoop that comes with it has no good resting place.  We improvised and drilled a small hole in the handle, placing a magnetic hook on the side of the machine, where the scoop now hangs.  It's a nice workaround, but probably should have been included with the unit.

I don't see much use for the small or medium ice settings, as those ice bullets are quite small, and easily melt away, due to the nature of the shape and temperature of this ice.  But, the large bullets work really well for beverages.

I would not recommend this ice maker for applications where you need hard, crystallized ice, such as icing down an injury.  You'll want harder, more substantial ice for that.  But, for drinks, and at the reasonable sales price, this thing is just what the doctor ordered!",08-04-2017

But after less then one year of owning this ice machine it is dead.  Will make no ice at all.  The fan and condenser run and run and nothing.  Sad this did start off as a good product as you see from my review when I received it but NOW it sits in Garage broken.  SAD many products fail so quickly anymore!!!
Disappointed to say the lease

So I have been looking for a table top ice maker for awhile.  And well reviews were good for this with some hiccups.  But after a couple weeks I will have to say this is a 5 star product so far.  It came in a double box to protect it.  So the package was in perfect condition.  The machine its self looks very nice.  You do have to add water into the bottom well and no, there is no freezer that keeps ice cold.  There is also a drain line, but I think besides to empty and clean you really do not need to mess with it.

The machine started right up,  It is very quiet and we have it set on medium size cubs and does make them in.... say 7 to 10 minutes per cycle.  Maybe the small ice cubes come out quicker but we like middle size.  If you leave the ice, yes it will melt, yes it will stick together, but take the scoop they give you and they break right apart to scoop out.

To add there was no plastic taste what so ever for us.  inside was wrapped and clean, we did wipe it out with soapy water and turned it on.  So far great machine, good ice, quiet and looks good.",07-06-2017

I have only one (relatively) small refrigerator and when preparing for guests, the fridge & freezer space is at a premium.  I thought this unit may alleviate having to make room in the freezer for purchased ice.  Once I received it, I gave it a test run.  Turns out it takes ~four hours for the bin to get full.  (This was confirmed in another review here.)  Ok, fine.  It's easy enough to start it up four hours ahead of when I need it.  BUT...once the bin is full, it only takes a few people who want a lot of ice in smallish glasses (~8 oz) to pretty much empty the bin... So for *MY* purposes, this was not helpful & I have returned the unit.  I would say that if need a smallish amount of ice throughout the day or evening and don't mind donating the space (this is a BIG unit), this ice maker would be great.  But (IMO/IME), don't count on this to keep you flowing in ice for a somewhat large gathering.  Oh and yes, it does make noise when dumping the ice.  Just like a regular ice maker does.

So far I've been running it for 5 days straight all day all night.  I also have not had a problem with my ice freezing together.  To stop that from happening before I dump the ice into the ice bags I pour out all the excess water in the tray and put it in the freezer.  Perfect ice cubes!

I settled on 3 because my issue was that big of a deal to me.  My issue?  The basket only  fills half way with ice.  The placement of the sensor is in a spot where it registers the ice is full, when it is only half full, which is not very much ice.  We use our ice maker for parties, and three drinks can wipe out the amount of ice it has when it says it is full.  Not cool!  (no pun intended)

I really like the size of the ice (we use the large).  I like that it has a drain on the side to drain the old water for ease of cleaning.  It holds more water, which is nice.  I would really like the larger size if it actually held more ice.  We previously had two Igloo ice makers and the baskets would get completely full, but was much smaller in size.

I've only had it for a day, so this is just my initial thoughts.  I will come back and review if anything changes (good or bad) in the coming weeks.

Would I buy it again?  Well, if I could find one that held more ice... no way.  Slightly disappointed, but happy to have any ice at all.

Update: Worked great for 11 months before the motor broke and couldn't lift the ice. No problem since this has a one year warranty, right?  Except the only way to contact the company on their US site is through a web form that gets an error when you try to submit.  I can't find any replacement parts for it so now I've got a large paperweight.  Changed from 3 stars to 1 star.",06-12-2017

Flawless performance!,"My refrigerator is not near a water line so making ice must be done with ice cube trays or an ice making machine.  This ice machine reliably cranks out ice for home use.  By no means is this made for commercial use but to fill several glasses of ice for a meal, with more left over, it's great.  I have only used the small setting which seems to fit glasses well.  Of course, you can always bag ice ahead of time and keep it in your freezer for occassions where you'll need a several bags.  The chamber where the ice is kept is insulated but not refrigerated so the ice will eventually melt.  However the water reservoir is below the vented ice basket so the water simply refreezes into more ice.  It comes with a perfectly usable white plastic scoop but I bought a metal scoop because I liked the design.

Pros:
Preforms as advertised.
Quiet except for the occasional sound of ice dropping in the basket.

Cons:
This unit is fairly big and takes up a good bit of kitchen counter real-estate.

This thing has a pretty large footprint, so take note of the dimensions and make sure that it can fit comfortably on your counter top.

I think that the downfall of this machine and others like it is that it isn't refrigerated.  So any ice that it drops into the tray immediately starts melting.  This is problematic if you're wanting to save up the ice and put it in the freezer (in bags, or in our case an ice dispenser).  The melty ice just forms a single solid block once it re-freezes.

That being said; I love this machine. We have had this machine for a three months and it has been running everyday. The biggest thing I will have to note for everyone is the ice is wet ice. I read previous reviews and the one comment that helped the most was, put the ice from the basket in a zip lock bag and put it in the freezer. The ice will freeze together making it difficult to break apart. Putting it in a bag every batch makes it easier to break up and put into a bucket for storage or use. The noise level is louder than a refrigerator, but it doesn't bother us at all.",05-07-2017

You may experience that the tray will rotate back & forward then stop & it is stopped at an angle & will not pour water anymore. After this has happened the green light will blink while the machine is on Signifying that it no longer works. You may also experience the ice tray may crack. Due to excessive back & forth dropping the ice & water pouring in the tray which is normal. It's supposed to do that. Standard wear & tear. As well the rotating metal joints that rotate the tray will get rusted. I took the top off & used WD-40 to spray & lubricate it & it started working again. This all happened to me but be warned. This machine will only last about a year ounce you start using it. That is if you use it everyday. One more thing regardless of the maker the design of this ice maker is the same.

I was accustomed to ice makers in refrigerators but this is a sit-alone. I keep it in the garage where the temps are warm. The only freezing area inside is the actual ice tray while the rest is water and ice storage. This means after turning it on the unit starts making ice and dumping into the bin but the ice quickly melts back into the water tank and does so until all the water is close to freezing temp. From then ice lasts long enough to accumulate quickly. If I start the process around 10 AM I can use the ice in a couple of hours. By 5 I've got about a gallon of ice put away in the freezer.,04-30-2017

The ice cubes can be made in 3 sizes; small, medium & large. The large cubes are not very large at all. It DOES make ice cubes relatively quickly, but it does not have a refrigerated holder for the ice. There is simply a basket where the cubes get dumped that is right above the water reservoir. As soon as the cubes are barely frozen, they are dumped into the basket and start to melt. In the 10 minutes it takes for the next small batch of ice to be made, the first batch is nearly melted. It's a constant cycle of freeze & thaw. I even tried dumping the ice into a bag and putting it in my freezer right away. Not only is that a pain in the rear, the cubes just froze together in my freezer because they barely freeze in this ""ice machine."" Do not waste your money. I'm returning this junk.",12-19-2016

The fan seems to get a little louder the longer you run it, at least the first day, but we are putting it in a closet and it shouldn't be a problem. It takes about 4-5 hours to get a gallon bag of ice. It seemed to get quicker the more we used it. We love the ice however. My husband didn't like it setting on the counter, thought it was too bulky and was reluctant to keep at first. But I found a great place for it in our closet and he really liked having the ice on hand with such a small amount that our refrigerator makes. If you can't do a built in, this is a good solution. Word of caution, however, the very tiny white plug for the drain got lost after the second day. I didn't tell my husband about it specifically and he didn't realize there was another piece before screwing the cap on. Gone. I wrote to amazon asking to purchase several of these for future losses and got a reply within 48 hours. They contacted the company, which is in UK, and they are shipping extra plugs to me.

Like other ice makers in this category, this machine requires a fair bit of counter space at about an 18"" square footprint, with needed space to the left of the machine for the exhaust fan.  We use this in a travel trailer, and the cabinet gets a bit crowded.
The exhaust hasn't caused any problems heating up the trailer space.
The stainless cabinet is attractive (even if it doesn't match the decor, lol),  and the display is easy to see and understand.
At around 25 lbs, it is heavy enough to stay put on the cabinet while traveling.  The cord is long enough to give you options on where to plug it in.

Fit.
The lid feels more solid than on a previous unit we had, and the tray fits well.  The cabinet is well-made.  (Not a lot to comment on, here.)

Function,
This is my second ice machine.  The other one, from a different maker, failed after a year.
This one is fantastic.  We had ice in mere minutes, and the tray was full in about an hour.
The features on this are limited, but that's a good thing.  The last one had a timer, settable start and stop times, an LCD display and a bunch of other unnecessary and, frankly, annoying crap on it.  Beeped all the damn time.  2 AM seemed to be a favorite.
This one just makes ice in, supposedly 3 different sizes.  It has lights for ""Low Water"" and ""Full of Ice"", and for cube size.  OK, ""Tube"" would be more appropriate than ""cube"", but you get the idea.
In the matter of ice size, I really couldn't tell the difference between the settings.  I guess it could matter if you had a small container to put it in, but we're using it for ice water in 30 oz tumblers, so...
If you are planning to make this ice to bag up and store, this type of ice maker isn't what you want.  The ice it makes is wet, and will form a solid chunk of ice if hard frozen.  The cubes have a tendency to meld together on the machine if left unattended, but it breaks up easily put it in a glass.

I am very satisfied with this purchase, and have already recommended it to a few people.

It does make a racket when dropping the ice after each batch.  It was loud enough that I could hear during the middle of the night and it is a startling kind of sound.  We had a BBQ gathering and we placed this outside in the patio.  It performed flawlessly and we were never ran out of ice.  This is a great alternative instead of spending thousands on a built in ice maker in the patio.  It is portable, so we have used it indoors or outdoors as the need arises.",10-17-2016
