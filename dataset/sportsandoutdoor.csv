https://www.amazon.com/CAT-EYE-Computer-Odometer-Speedometer/dp/B007YV1GM4,18,Sports and Outdoor,"CATEYE, Velo 7 Wired Bike Computer with Odometer and Speedometer",4.5,5,simple,"I think this is my 5th CatEye bike computer (I can't stop buying bikes) and by far the least expensive and most simple.  Previous models have been wireless but after spending a lot of time trouble shooting a model with a second wireless sensor with cadence I was burnt out on it and wanted a simple hard wired unit that records basic data (time duration, average speed, trip odometer and odometer that doesn't reset with other data).  The only other thing I really wanted in the computer was that it would auto pause when not moving so I didn't have to remember to turn it on or off when stopping for a break or stoplight.

This computer does all of that with a large display and low price tag.",03-04-2013

The numbers are easy to read while biking and the screens are easily changed by pressing the black button which can be done even if the rider wears thick gloves. The information provided is basic (time of day, distance travelled, average/top speed, and odometer). The auto stop feature works well. This computer works for only 1 bike at a time and the information cannot be uploaded onto a PC. For those who want a basic and easy to use bicycle computer, this one is very good and reasonably priced.",02-20-2013

https://www.amazon.com/CAT-EYE-Computer-Odometer-Speedometer/dp/B007YV1GM4,18,Sports and Outdoor,"CATEYE, Velo 7 Wired Bike Computer with Odometer and Speedometer",4.5,4,Great value for a basic cycling computer,"Pros:  Clear, easy to read display; Auto on/off; Easy one-button operation; Mounting bracket may be mounted on the stem or the handlebar; Easy installation and setup (especially if you've used an older Cateye model); User manual is downloadable from the Cateye site so that you don't have to keep track of the paper manual when you need to reset to a different tire size or change battery

Cons:  The computer attaches to the mounting bracket using friction only (no release button), so I'm not sure if it would work well for serious mountain biking, but it's fine for road or trail riding.  The wiring is not as heavy duty as the older models, so you want to make sure that you follow the instructions and route your wiring with enough slack to avoid pulling it when you turn the handlebar.

Overall, this cycle computer is a great value considering that it doesn't cost much more that the discount store models.  It works great and, short of being abused, should give years of service.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one if I get another bike.",11-20-2012

The wire was not long enough to keep the display on the handlebars, so I moved it to just underneath. I can still read it because the numbers are nice and big. Also, the rear fork is farther away from the spokes on the back wheel compared to the front wheel, so I cut up a chopstick and made a spacer. I just taped it on; I will probably need more tape if I ride in the rain. After those two simple modifications, now I can use it with my trainer just as easily.",02-21-2017

Instructions don't make a lot of sense but follow these basic steps.,"Spin cycles don't come with a lot of options, especially computers for keeping track of your distance and time. Since I have been cycling everyday, this computer was a fantastic addition to keeping me on pace. It's very reasonable at $20 and takes about five minutes to install.

The instructions that come with the computer don't make a whole lot of sense but if you look up ""how to install a computer"" on a bike (YouTube) there are pretty good instructions that will make more sense.

For those who don't want to go to Youtube:

1. Find the part that looks like an stick - this is the antenna. You will want to stick this to the inner part of your bike frame so that it comes within 5mm of your front wheel.
2. Find the part that looks like a watch battery. You can stick this to your flywheel (near the middle of the bike) and line it up so it crosses the black line on the antenna when it rotates.
3. Secure the parts to the bike and slip the computer into the antenna receiver and start riding.",01-30-2017

It has a big screen, which as a young male I thought who cares? But this makes a difference! At a glance lets me keep my eyes on the road. I use this on my touring bike and its simplicity is perfect for the job. There is only one button to cycle through the modes and I typically leave it on trip distance. There's nothing too fancy about this. It is also the first wired bike computer I have bought and I am pretty happy with it! I love the way only one battery is required because I am sick of having to replace two on the wireless units each time one of them dies. However, I will still be using wireless units for road biking, but I would buy this unit for any other type of riding I do.

I took off one star because of the build quality. I was disappointed especially with the wire that connects the monitor to the sensor. It is a little cheap and I feel like CatEye could have made a better effort to make where the wire connects to the two components  little sturdier. I have not expereinced any issues yet with this, but that was definitely a little disappointing.

The setup is more difficult than it should be, and the instructions are really lame and hard to follow. Custom wheel size can only be set to 3 digits; ""215"" CM instead of ""2155"" for my 700c x 32 tires, for example. Close enough, but how hard would it have been for them to allow 4-digit calibration?

HINT: If you get stuck in setup with it toggling between ""kmh"" and ""mph"" for a hour or two or even more, as I did - you aren't pressing the little buttons on the back in deep enough. Your finger won't work, and neither will the end of a nylon wire tie. Break off a wooden toothpick and use the blunt end. That works.

My one big complaint with this thing is that it only display two items on the display. I'd like to have speed, distance and elapsed time all on the display at one time.

Easy to us, easy to pull off the bike when you want to. Nice large display. I have had an annoying issue with the intermittent readout though, which I finally traced to the mount. This is a manufacturing issue in that the problem emerges from the assumption that the  contacts, when inserted in to the tiny slots in the mount, are going to penetrate the insulation wires from the sensor and make contact with the copper wire inside. This probably works just fine most of the time, but in the case of my mount on my mountain bike, sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. The penetrators didn't make good contact. Pretty frustrating. The solution is to slip a tiny screwdriver (like the like used for eyeglass screws) under the contact and pry it out. Its just pressed in to place (not soldered or glued), and Its pretty tough, and won't break. Each contact has three tiny sharp barbs on it. Its possible that the wire is not quite centered so the the barbs miss the center of the insulation, or that the wires are a tiny bit short so that the copper wire just isn't there to stab in to. If you are lucky, you can just press the contact back in to place and make contact with the copper, but in my case I had to disassemble the cemented works underneath and remove the sensor wire, then provide slightly longer wire in to the point where the contacts meet the wire. This resolved my issue. Since I was having to do work with the sensor wires and pull them anyway,  I figured I'd replace the original sensor wire with the old sensor wire from my ancient Vetta 100, which has a braided metal and vinyl cover (specifically for mountain biking). This works just fine now. If you just pull the contact out and put it back (trying to center it on the insulation), this will probably fix your problem in most cases. Anyway its worth a try before you toss the sensor and computer. I'd give the computer a five, if not for this issue. My wife has a Velo 7 on her mountain bike, and I also have another Velo 7 on my road bike, and neither of those has any issues with intermittent readings, so most of the time the pressed in barbed contact manufacturing method works just fine, I guess.",10-08-2016

#2. Cable was long enough from wheel sensor to the Bikes handle bar.

Cons:

#1. No Back Light ( so if you ride at Night You won't see the screen very well ) Quick fix = I added a portable small book light over it :)
#2. there is no Off Switch But it semi turns itself off,,,,, after 10 minutes you will only see the time.
#3. The wheel magnet is not long enough to reach the minimum 5mm space requirement between the magnet and the wheel sensor. (Quick Fix = add a spacer on the wheel fork before adding the wheel sensor to fork, or wrap plenty of electric tape where ever you plan to place the sensor on the wheel fork so that the sensor can be more closer to the wheel/magnet. or create your own idea to go around that problem.  Hope This helps somebody that also buys this.

Cateye has newer versions of this same computer now, but I think they're worse than this one. With the addition of more ""features,"" it takes more button presses to cycle back around to the information you care about. And the additional ""features"" on the newer models aren't helpful: A calorie estimate, which doesn't account for elevation changes, and a carbon offset guesstimate, which is just stupid to have on there. If you care about those features, you're better off determining them yourself after the trip using the distance and average speed provided on this model.
I'd recommend this model for anyone that enjoys cycling but doesn't require a GPS-enabled model.",05-12-2016

There may be computers with more features but you might pay a lot for each extra feature.

Setup is a bit fiddly. There is no changing units (km/mi) without resetting and losing the odometer. Likewise if changing tire size you will lose the odometer. Once you get the hang of it it goes pretty quickly. It is far to easy to do a pocket all clear so I put transparent tape over the all clear button. No problems since.

I bought one to try out then got two more for my other bikes. It's nice to be able to know how fast you are going, what time it is, how far you have traveled, how many miles are on your tires, etc.

Mounting them is not difficult. Figure out where you want them on the bars or stem, stick and zip-tie it on, wind the cable around bars, brake cable, and fork. Then figure out where on the spokes the magnet needs to go to have the right clearance from the sensor - you need to work with both sensor and magnet at the same time. Once you figure that out wrap all the excess cable so it doesn't cause trouble, then stick and zip-tie the sensor to the fork. I put them on the drive side but some say use the non-drive side. No issues with stuff coming loose or going out of adjustment.

Things I would change:
- allow changing units, tire size without doing a full reset.
- make it harder to pocket reset (did that twice before taping the AC button)

I've also installed these on my kids bikes and they are all still working 10+ years later. I installed this one on a Trek Mountain bike with 26"" wheels and the installation was a breeze. The attachment of the sensor on the fork and the receiver on the handlebars is straight forward and not difficult...the unit was up and running in 20 minutes and I took my time. It's very simple to set up with the pre-loaded tire sizes and just as easy to learn the different functions. You can toggle through the individual functions quite easily while riding and I like the single button control versus my dual button control of the Enduro. My buddy has a wireless version and it isn't nearly as reliable as this wired unit. Folks, for $20+ dollars, you can't get a better, more reliable bike speedometer. I can't recommend this product more strongly.

One thing I will mention, when I bought the Enduro model, CatEye provided a plastic wire wrap that you used to piggyback the speedo wire to one of your brake or shifter cables...and that made for a very clean look and install.

I started riding again after my two kids got old enough to be on their own. I ride mostly in town, commuting ten miles or so to and from the usual places, but I also started going on some suitably longer trips out into the countryside. And after a while, after all that time spent pedaling and pedaling, one begins to wonder certain things, like: ""How fast am I actually going, how many miles am I traveling on these trips, and how long is all of this taking?""

I know what you're thinking: ""So why do I need a bike computer when all this information can be obtained using my smartphone's maps or other such apps along with GPS positioning?"" Well, I tried that, and even after just a few trips, this bike computer is MUCH easier to use than any smartphone. Some things like this computer or any bike computer for that matter are just better suited to do one specific job.

Anyway, everything is included in order to successfully install the VELO 7. If anything, you might need a few more zip ties. It took me about an hour. I have a TREK mountain bike. It has shocks, V-brakes and handlebars with a three inch rise. I also have a handlebar pannier that is situated out in front and just above the brake and shift cables; it's two handlebar clamps take up some clamping space to either side of the center handlebar clamp, and because of this, there's not much space left to add accessories like this computer. Even with all of this STUFF to contend with, installation was still a breeze.

If you are thinking about installing the sensor to the rear wheel, Cuz Front Shocks, then stop that nonsense, because you won't be able to do it; the wire that runs from the wheel up to the computer itself is not long enough for rear wheel installation. It doesn't matter anyway because everything has been thought out well enough so that you can install the computer to any set of shocks.

You can mount the VELO 7 on either your handlebars (parallel to you) or on your goose neck (perpendicular to you). The mount has two sets of half circles for either orientation. But if you are thinking about mounting the computer to an up-bend on your handlebars, then just realize that the mount cannot be angled back flat to the ground. The mount is rigid; it does not tilt in other words.

Theft deterrent. The computer can be removed from the mount while you're away from your bike. Just slip it into your pocket!

NOTE: If you really want to make the computer's data output as accurate as possible, then you need to measure the wheel's circumference as accurately as possible. Do this by marking off and measuring the distance the wheel travels in one rotation using a flat surface like the cement in your garage. Do this WHILE SITTING ON THE BIKE. If you go by the chart, then you might be off by as much as a few centimeters. That's because your tire flattens under your added weight which shortens the actual radius of the wheel/tire. Once you have this measurement (rounded to the closest centimeter, mine was 201cm) write that number down as you will input it into the computer later on.

NOTE: It matters not where on your spokes and forks you mount the two sensor parts. The computer doesn't use radius measurements of any kind from your wheel for calculating data, but circumference instead (See note above).

So it's easy to install, but what about the computer's functionality you ask? Well, that is even better!

SIMPLICITY. That's how I would describe the functionality of the VELO 7. It has only one big button to push and one big screen to look at. That's it, and that's how it should be once you think about it: You have only one hand to push only one button, cuz the other one should be steering. And you want to be able to glance down and read the info on the big screen quickly and easily, because obviously you should be watching where you're going instead.

Always on the top of the screen is SPEED. So too is something called PACE ARROW(s). SPEED is obvious but PACE not so much. These PACE ARROWS - one up, one down, or both showing at the same time - tell you when you are going faster, slower, or the same speed as your average speed.

Oh, also always showing on the screen are the letters MPH, miles per hour (or KPH, kilometer per hour, if you're into that sorta thing). MPH starts flashing when you begin your trip and stays flashing until you stop at any time.  The flashing MPH kinda tells you that the computer is working, making the necessary calculations. (Elapsed time is related to the flashing MPH, see below.)

Pressing the big button toggles the bottom of the screen through: TM, elapsed time; DST, current trip distance; AV, average speed; MX, maximum speed; ODO, total of ALL miles regardless of current trip distance; and CLOCK, the time of day.

ONE INTERESTING NOTE: The computer will stop counting elapsed time when you stop the bike. This is actually a good thing. It resumes when you begin peddling again. The flashing MPH tells you that elapsed time is happening. They are one and the same.

Pressing and holding the big button for a few seconds resets everything on the current trip. All except ODO and CLOCK. ODO and CLOCK are permanent.

That is until you hit the ALL CLEAR button on the back of the computer.

There is an ALL CLEAR and RESET button on the back of the computer; both are small and recessed. ALL CLEAR clears the computer back the factory settings, resetting ODO and CLOCK to zero. RESET is a bit different; it allows you to change the CLOCK, change MPH or KPH, and change the circumference setting of your wheel. All this without resetting the ODO.

I read online somewhere that the battery lasts for years. We'll see. The computer goes dormant after a while, and then only the clock is shown on the screen. As soon as you get on your bike and start a new trip, the computer wakes up automatically . KUDOS!!!

The hardest part probably, and it's not really that difficult once you get the hang of things, is setting up the computer itself. You have to push the RESET button on the back and toggle through some simple menus using the big button on the front, then input some info. I liken it to setting up a Casio wristwatch. Remember those things? Push the wrong button and you're back resetting everything and starting over. It can get frustrating. But it's not that bad though really.

Simple to install. Easy to use. Intuitive design. Actually gives you valuable data at a glance when riding. Smarter than some people I know. A big screen. This thing will literally ""Get You To The Church On Time.""

The price is great for what you get. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

-----UPDATE:8/13/2015-----

I started having some weird intermittent signal generation problems. When riding, the computer would go to 0 (zero) MPH and ELAPSED TIME would stop. It would then start up again, then stop, then start. But things finally got worse and it stopped altogether. At first I thought it was the sensor down on the wheel; I thought the two sensor parts were misaligned or were too far apart to work properly. But that was not the case.

The problem instead was a loose wire up on the mount. I must have removed the computer from the mount once too forcefully because one of those metal pickups dislodged itself just enough from its wire to stop making contact, either that or they were never properly aligned to begin with. So, I had to realign the pickup with its wire. I did this by popping out pickup from the wire using a sharp, pointed knife. Then I just pressed it back into the wire. This must have done the trick because the computer began to work again. No more intermittent signal problems.

Little things like this can drive me crazy. But, I'll just file this one under ""Working Out All The Bugs."" Still Highly Recommended!",08-08-2015

I see a check mark above a zero. It should start at 0:00. Pretty lame.
I looked on line for instructions and no help. No idea on how to enter the Clock Mode. I have tried for one hour.

Finally found an answer in Reviews but will still only rate it Ok. Others have said not able to set time.
I could not get the clock to set a time and I finally found out what I was doing wrong by watching a video on the internet. What I was doing was pushing ""set"" right after I chose a 12 hour clock. You have to choose the 12, push mode and then set the clock. Don't push ""set"" until you're completely finished.

I will give this a higher rating now. Auto start which is very nice.
Very consistent. I have had two wireless sold by other company that do not always resister. Trashed them.
Another nice thing is only one battery needed.
If the cable ever breaks, put shrink tube over one pair. Strip back insulation and solder the stranded wires insulating each wire. Heat shrink. Use magnet to check.",08-04-2015

I had a Cateye Velo 5 on the Trek to which I didn't want to remove, so I bought this for the Raleigh.  Installation was simple and quick, just like the Velo 5.  I thought I was going to need a shim for the sensor that mounts on the fork, so it would be within the recommended 5mm of the magnet that mounts on the spokes.  Much to my delight, the sensor picked up the magnet without needing to be within 5mm.  I made sure there was enough slack in the wire to account for the movement of the fork, and went on my way.  I've done some greenway (smooth) riding and some pretty intense offroad (rough) riding and haven't had any problems so far.

I went with the Velo 7 because it was simple.  I don't care about cadence and wireless setups seemed finicky.

This last time, however, I did notice there was a pretty significant discrepancy between the Cateye and the GPS on my phone.  The Cateye said we rode 11 miles and the GPS on the phone (via the Strava app) said 9.5 miles.  Perhaps the phone had problems because we were in a wooded area; perhaps the magnet and/or the sensor are dirty.  I wouldn't mind a few tenths of a mile difference but 1.5 miles is enough of a difference to wonder which is right.

https://www.amazon.com/CAT-EYE-Computer-Odometer-Speedometer/dp/B007YV1GM4,18,Sports and Outdoor,"CATEYE, Velo 7 Wired Bike Computer with Odometer and Speedometer",4.5,2,A few disappointments,"I have a Cateye Mity 8 on my bike that I have enjoyed for years, and I bought this for my wife's.  However I am disappointed in this unit.  The first problem I had was that the cord is too short on it.  I was able to mount it to her Jamis Citizen Hybrid bike, but I was unable to really secure the wire like I wanted.  It seems that the wire is just long enough to be used in the middle of the handle bars or stem.  For other reasons I put her out on the ends of the bars just inside the grips, but I was unable to wrap the wire around the brake cables.  Instead I zip tied it to some key points on the bars and the forks, but there is a section that runs along the head tube that just hangs out there with no other support.  If it gets snagged, it is a goner.

My next disappointment in it was the lack of being able to preset the odometer like the Mity 8 allows.  This is a pain because I already know how many miles are on the bike and wanted it to start with that number.  Cateye computers also reset the odometer when changing the battery, so this feature was to manually input the mileage again.

My biggest disappointment in it though is in the Odometer display itself.  It doesn't display tenths of a mile (my Mity 8 does).  All the other modes will display tenths, but not the odometer.

The mount for the unit itself doesn't have a press down latch to release the unit.  It uses a friction system that takes a little bit of force to pop it off, but I can see that wearing out after some time.",06-02-2015

I purchased it for my 7 yo son's bike, who always wants to know how fast he can possibly go. Previously I've purchased the Bell Dashboard 100 cyclocomputer and an almost identical Schwinn model.  Both of those were harder to program and failed within a year.

The CatEye is just about double the price, but well worth it I think.  The display is much larger and thus easier to read. The design is stylish and the black/white/silver colors go with any bike. Everything about programming and mounting the unit was better and easier than with the Bell and Schwinn ones. It can be mounted on either the handle bar or stem, which is good because the handle bars can get crowded with lights and bells and whatnots. We chose the stem to mount it, and it looks right at home there.

The Bell and Schwinn units were very fussy about placement of the magnet and sensor - the magnet had to pass within (literally) 1 mm of the sensor to be picked up.  The CatEye is much more forgiving and 5 - 8 mm works fine. The system for mounting the magnet on the spokes is also much better, very stable.

The manual is well written and in many languages. There are many common tire sizes listed to help you calibrate the unit during programming; however, there are also clear instructions on how to calibrate it if your tire isn't listed. That was very helpful since little kids' 20"" tires are not listed.

One surprisingly nice feature, and one I hadn't even considered before, is the inclusion of a clock. It's a small thing, but as I said, surprisingly nice.",03-21-2015

Directions recommends how to route the wire and if you attempt to do it in that manner its too short.  I found the directions in setting the unit somewhat difficult, finally did so by trial and error after many attempts. Installing sensor and magnet which attach to spokes, required modification to the unit to bring it close enough them close enough.  Cateye has good reviews and I am quite surprised they didn't do a  better job designing this unit. It may fit the touring bike much better, do to the fact the tire to handle bars are closer together and the fork tend to be narrower which allows the sending unit to be installed closer to the spokes.  I have mounted numerous speed computers and this was the most difficult.  Cateye needs to extend the wire another 6 inches and design the pickup/sending unit mount with more adjust ability in mounting.",03-19-2015

But now I wish it had just a couple of extra features.,"I read a lot of reviews on bike computers before purchasing, and ultimately this Velo 7 is what I need. I have separately a GPS watch with a heart rate monitor which I could wear if I wanted, so I did not need the extra functions on the computer itself. The only thing which made me consider others brands and models was the lack of cadence function. A good friend of mine who rides with me often checks the cadence all the time and adjusts his workout. The Velo 7 does not track cadence, which is fine by me. That said, I use this on a regular mountain bike, not on a spinning bike.

Installation took about 10 minutes. Menu setup took another 5 minutes. The instructions are good. Pictures and flow-charts are included, which helps a lot. You can't beat the price of this product either.

I would give it 5+ stars if it had a backlit screen. Right now the screen is a little dim. I do ride my bike after dark sometimes, not often but it happens, and a brighter screen would have been nicer.

I am also not a big fan of the zip-tie installation. I would have liked it better if they made an actual mounting bracket for the base, rather than using zip-ties to attach the base.",02-13-2015

Now, about the instrument. It is accurate, big numbers display very clearly, portable, removes easily from mount attached to handlebar (a must to avoid theft), well built and apparently weather resistant to dust and rain (the button battery case in the back has an o-ring to seal it against weather) and the battery is included. It gives you the actual time, time it took for the ride, actual speed, average speed of the ride, maximum speed of the ride, distance traveled and keeps an odometer reading. It stops working if inactive for a few minutes, like in your pocket. It gives readings in miles or kilometers, your option.
All you need to install this gadget is included in the package. Installation, including deciphering instructions, should not take you a half hour. Then, ride off into the sunset knowing you have quite an accurate and reliable instrument. I checked it against Google maps for distance verification and it was right on!

https://www.amazon.com/CAT-EYE-Computer-Odometer-Speedometer/dp/B007YV1GM4,18,Sports and Outdoor,"CATEYE, Velo 7 Wired Bike Computer with Odometer and Speedometer",4.5,5,Impressive-,"To test this units accuracy for distance, you need to first measure off one mile. I drove three different cars until the odometer showed I traveled one mile and marked it.  You would think all three cars would end up all on the same line after the odometer showed I travel one mile but they didnt.  They were all different.  So I thought well which one of the cars is the most accurate, well none of them were, they were all at least 50 to a  100 yards shy of one mile according to using a laser range finder. I used a laser ranger finder that has an accuracy of +/-  of one yard to measure off one mile.  Forget the mile markers on the side of the interstate or the mile markers on the bike path to measure one mile.  I don't think those are exaclty spaced one mile apart from my own experiences.  After measuring the circumference of my tire in cm, I added that figure into the Cateye and rode my bike to where I marked one mile with the laser range finder and I still came up short.  The unit showed I traveled one mile but I still had a little ways to go to get to the line I marked with the rangefinder.  I then subtracted 6cm from the total tire circumference and entered that # into the cateye then rode one mile and the accuracy was right on the money.  So you may have to do some trial and error to get this unit very accurate. The factory settings will get you I would say within 20 yards accuracy or so depending upon the size of your tire. 20 yards is not that bad, but if your a precisionist like me, you want it down to a yard or so.  To measure the circumference, roll the bike forward until the air stem on the front tire is pointing straight up (six oclock position)then put a coin on the ground to mark it.  Then roll the bike forward one revolution until the stem is back at the six o'clock position,then put a coin there.  Measure the distance between the 2 coins in inches then convert that to cm, then in the 'tire size mode' on the unit look for the 205 #, click on that and change that 205# to the cm of your tire circumference.  Over all its really a nice product, user friendly, easy to install and use, no complaints.  If you have any questions, shoot me a message, Id be glad to help.",11-12-2014

Once set you only need the dual button on the front.  A back light button would be nice (if it had one).

Since it involves running wire on a bike You may want to have some extra tie wraps handy to account for the trial and error of a first time mounting. (I bought 2 of these and the second one went in super fast/easy.)

  Thanks to the person saying extrema heat in a  super hot car can cook one of these.  Really that is just common sense but, Good to know.

Assuming it holds up I would call this a 5 star unit.  Very solid operation!!!
My guess is its pretty dam accurate with just factory settings. Odds are I will end up with one of these on all my bikes.

Bought Giant Escape Hybrid Bike and ordered two of these computers, sold the old bike with computer on it.  One went on my husband's diamondback mountain bike and another on my new hybrid bike.  I have found in all three bikes it is accurate to my gps apps within a block on a 16 mile avg ride.  I don't need perfection, this is amazing!  Another pro is that it stops counting avg speed while stopped.  This is great for me bc 4 times I get stuck at lights.

The only complaint I have is that it uses cable ties to hold the mount to the handle bars. While making it easy to mount on any size bar, the cable ties don't hold the mount as tight as I'd like. The slightest bump of the mount or unit rotates it on the bar. On the plus side, the cable tie mount system allows the mount to be installed on the stem or even the top bar as well as the handle bars. It comes with a little piece of rubber that is supposed to go under the mount. If that piece were large enough to wrap around the bar, it would probably do a much better job of keeping the mount stationary.",06-14-2014

But I'm delighted with the purchase. It tells you how far you've ridden, how fast you're going, your average speed, duration, top speed - just about anything you'd care to know. It's great for setting goals for your rides and monitoring them as you go. And it's also good for setting limitations - like distance, or time. If I know I only want to go 20 miles, I can turn around at precisely the 10-mile point. Same for ride duration. It's good for gauging your progress as you build up your endurance over time. The installation is simple. In fact, the illustrations were all I needed to set it up. So if you're not into reading instructions, you can get by on the drawings alone. Instructions are also provided for all the functions you can use after setting it up. For me, I'm only interested in speed and distance, so I set it to display those. After a ride, if I want to know my average speed, top speed or ride duration, I can see those readings just by toggling through them using the button at the bottom. I don't know if most riders have things like this, but I'm glad I do. It's helping me to stay on track with my fitness goals. And, in the winter when I bring the bike inside, it gives me something to gauge my exercise rides on the stationary stand.",05-10-2014

It's a a fairly simple gadget - it has one big button that you keep pushing to look at the the various data (distance, time and etc) and it as reset and set button on the back.

The only gripes I have are:

1. I wish they gave you more ties
2. I wish it had a backlight button - I bike at night a lot and I can't read it
3. The display is too lose on the bar - it doesn't come with tape and the ties don't keep it from twirling around.

Other than that, it's simple - you tie the case into your handlebar, slide the display into the case, run the wire down the fork and wire it onto the fork and screw your magnet into a spoke near the reader.

I compared it against Map My Walk and was pretty impressed how accurate it was, it's not dead on (I think cause I just used the 700c setting) but it's close enough like MMW 7.0 miles versus this gadget would have 7.2 or 7.3.

On my TREK Shift 4, the Velo mount fits perfectly on the stem, just behind/below the handlebars.  It mounts easily and securely with small nylon ties (and a sticky pad on the inside of the mounting block keeps it from slipping--although, be sure to hold the mount in place as you remove the computer).  The wire between the pickup and the computer was, for me, the perfect length--I used thin wire-ties to secure the wire and hide it.  There are some really helpful computer setup videos on YouTube (look for the guy--BikemanforU, with the colorful charts--he only has videos for Velo-5 and 8, but 8 works for everything on the 7, but the clock (or, maybe I just didn't understand that part).  Even though I was only able to find one Velo-7 video--and it was in an Asian language--having already gotten the feel for things from BikemanforU, I was able to watch the Asian person's finger movements and figure out the clock--not too difficult, and it's great that I have all of the Velo functions operating).  After recording the details of a ride in my journal, it is very easy to reset the computer functions for my next ride.  BTW, BikemanforU (the colorful-chart guy), has a good video on measuring the circumference of your tire and converting it to centimeters.  His Velo 8 video shows you how to use a centimeter measurement rather than just choosing, say, the 26"" tire option (mine are 26"", but I choose to measure the tire circumference and enter it in centimeters to get the most accurate speed and distance readings.  (Pay attention to the last part of his video on measuring the tire; it tells you how to do it by marking the ground under the valve stem, rolling the tire one revolution and marking it again, then measuring the distance between marks and converting it to centimeters.  It was easiest way he showed to get the measurement (I used a black marker on my concrete driveway).  If you cut and paste the links below, I hope they take you where they should.

It is a basic bike computer with a nice detection wand that works really well.  I will start by pointing out that I only use this on my trainer (I use GPS and an iPhone on the road).  Since I use this only on the trainer, I do not keep it on the bike (take it off when I take the bike out of the trainer).  I got this solely for the trainer, so I could see speed and distance and got this unit since it was cheap (price wise) and is easy to read).

The unit is much smaller than I expected (from the photo), it is on par (size wise) with other bike computers (like the cheap ones with the Schwinn name).  Although it is small, it has a very high contrast screen making it super easy to read and the large numbers make this a quick glance item.

Installation is easy, you have the wand that goes on the frame (wherever you can put it for your use [usually the front frame]).  You just put the magnet on a spoke where it will pass the sensor.  I am installing this on the rear wheel (since I use it for a trainer).  The wand can be mounted using zip ties, I did notice that it has a sticky pad on the bottom (I would not stick this to my frame...).  However, zip ties are easy and safe on the frame.  You than run the cable (keep it away from the drive and feet area) to wherever you have the computer (if you have this on the handlebars you would just run it up the fork and tie it down, but make sure you still have wiggle room [do not taught it up where the frame and fork meet] for turning the handlebars).  I have this on my trainer (so I can look down and see the distance/speed), it will not reach from the rear wheel to the handlebars, fine with me; but FYI.

My only complaint with this product is the setup!  It is crazy hard (it is not a good sign when the manual is half the size of the packaging) to setup (not install, but actually setup the unit for use).  The instructions are lacking and the one manual (with the graphical flow chart) requires you to know information from the other manual...  You have to reset the unit using the back button, than the front button is used to increase or go through items, and you have to use the set button on the back (did not realize this at first).  When you go through it you will want to put in the basic information (preferences) and read the instructions on how to set the time and input the manual circumference (I would not use the generic choices, use the chart and manually enter your exact size for your wheel; otherwise your speed and distance will not be right).  Entering the time and circumference was tough since it no longer used set for moving to the next and introduced holding down the main button).  This unit looks great and is easy to use and operate once setup, but the setup of the unit is a design nightmare!

The unit offers numerous information.  The speed on the display is the main feature and I just keep the button in Distance mode.  The unit has other modes, but most likely distance is the main thing.  The Odometer is nice, but I let Strava keep track of that for me (I manually enter the numbers from this unit into Strava after exercising so it keeps track of the milage on bike [I use this for just general info and maintenance intervals]).  You can browse through information screens by pressing the center button and you can reset the workout by holding down the center button (this does not reset the ODO).

After 10 minutes of the sensor not detecting the magnet it will go to 'sleep' and just display the time.  I do not not see the point of this, since this seems like it would waste the battery, and if I am not moving I am not on the bike and do not need to know the time.  It is hard to say how the battery is, since I have not had this that long.  However, I just think it would go further without keeping the display on for the time.

In the end this is a great bike computer.  It has a large display with easy to read numbers and is easy to install (not so easy to setup, but once you do it, you are good; until the battery dies).  The unit detects the magnet with no problem and I have not had any issue.  It is very nice looking and works perfectly.  I am very happy with this unit and highly recommend it for a bike computer!",03-28-2014

The Velo 7 gives me how far and how fast for individual trip and cumulative. It has handled heavy rain and 20 degree (F) temperatures, though not simultaneously. The clock works and it tells me my average speed. I would not use it on my touring bike because it does not have the point to point measuring capacity of something like my VDO.

He somehow lost the bike computer he had on this bike. When we moved from Silicon Valley to 6200' near Yellowstone, the bike went into retirement. He really missed riding. Then this year we got him a Kinetic 2.0 bike trainer. He set that up in the house and realized he wanted the computer. This one is perfect, whether you're on the road or inside on a trainer. He is very happy with his setup now. The computer's magnetic counter is normally mounted on the front wheel, so out of the box the cable is not long enough to reach the back wheel, the only one that moves when the bike is on the trainer. He had some extra cable around and spliced that on. Works perfectly, and he can have the  readout unit on the handlebar.

Tire size 16""/ 18""/ 20""/ 22""/ 24""/ 26""/ 700C or 100cm299cm (default: 26"")

The above are all the preset tire size choices. 700c is the correct option to choose for 29"" tires. 700c is a term designated to road bike tires, although they are more narrow, the OUTSIDE diameter of 700c and 29"" tires are the same, thus this computer IS compatible with 29"" wheels. The number to be most concerned with when trying to find info regarding 29'er tires vs. 700c tires is the ISO number 622, which designates the circumference of both tires in MILLIMETERS. The ""c"" in 700c is an outdated designation for width, but has nothing to do with centimeters as it is often confused. I hope this helps someone. The 700c option proved to be very accurate for my Trek 29'er. Thanks.

This means I needed to mount the sensor on the rear wheel.  Wireless bike computers don't have the range to allow that, so I got this wired unit.  The wire is not long enough to reach from the rear wheel to the handlebar, so I mounted the display unit on the crossbar.  The wire is long enough that the computer display is pretty close to the handlebar, clearing the leg motion and not interfering with mounting/dismounting the bike and also is easy to see with a downward glance; it is essentially in the same field of view as a handlebar mount.
I also had to make a spacer to attach the sensor inboard close enough to the rear wheel that it senses the magnetic field from the magnet on the spoke. A piece of old nylon cutting board for the spacer, a file to shape it so the zip ties held it securely, and some hot glue to keep it from shifting were enough.
The computer itself is easy to use and easy to mount.  Unless you want a lot more features, this seems to work well.  It really is nice having one button to to change modes and reset for a trip.

Can't get much simpler.  The speed increments are every 0.1 mph (some I have owned are only to the nearest 0.5 mph).  The wire that goes from the computer to the sensor is not very heavy duty, but I actually prefer a smaller/thinner wire when wrapping around my cable housing.  I do wish they could make the sensors smaller, as it is rather bulky and is kind of an eyesore on my road bike's front fork.  I could not fit the sensor on the inside of the fork due to the shape of my wheel and spokes.  There is not enough room.  I recommend, if this is your case, to put the sensor on the FRONT of the fork, and not the back.  When the wheel turns, if the sensor gets knocked into the spokes, it could damage your wheel, or the computer, if you mount it on the back of the fork.  It's uglier on the front, but it's safer.  One other minor complaint is if you want to mount onto the stem, there is no way to adjust the wire, it comes out the back/bottom of the mount.  So then the wire has to be looped back toward the handlebar.  No big deal, just more wire issues to contend with.

For a wired computer, it has all the basic functions I want.  Pleased with it.

Once you set it up for presta or Schrader you can just leave it there and it's ready to go. You have to remember this is a mini pump and really it's for emergencies. It's not going to give you what a normal pump will do so you should always use a regular pump when your at home. One reminder is that Topeak has a great video on their website on how to use this pump if your having issues.

Not going to last,"Just awful.
1. no instructions - how much effort would it have taken to write one simple paragraph with pictures to show you how to use this ?

2. comes configured for a Presta valve - which essentially no tire in the country has.  Every bike, truck, motorcycle, car tire I've seen in my life has a Shrader valve.  This should have been stated in the product information, or again, in some simple instructions.  Yes, I eventually just took it apart out of frustration and figured out how to reverse everything to make it ""almost"" fit - but I should not have had to reverse engineer this thing on my own.

3. Still doesn't fit -- it seems like if you push the lever DOWN, it is ""open"" and if you pull it all the way UP, it is ""closed, locked.""  But who knows - again, no instructions at all to explain why they might have made this thing work as the opposite of every other hand pump or mechanical pump in the world.

4. poor fit - I have a standard Raleigh hybrid, nothing fancy or exotic - yet this thing has to be FORCED down on the valve stem to get it on at all - this forces the valve stem deeply inward -- and then to rip it off you nee both hands -- eventually this is guaranteed to ruin the threads on the hand pump, or the valve stem itself.

Too bad it took me a couple years after I bought this thing before I had need to use it - or it would have gone right back to amazon instantly.  Definitely not recommended - there have got to be simple hand pumps out there that just work - with a decent fit, and without having to reassemble them..",01-10-2016

The bikes keep getting better but curiously, the frame pumps (the ones you carry with you, on the frame or in a bag) seem to get worse. This one is Exhibit A, or more accurately Exhibit F for Fail.  Maybe it works OK for low-pressure tires but not for my road bike, which has 700x23 tires w/Presta valves that take 100 psi.  Today I had my first flat after buying this pump. Stripped out the bad tube, put in the new one that I carry, re-seated the tire & began trying to pump it full. After many minutes (and I'm not weak), best I could do was a cheesy soft inflation -- definitely not good enough to continue riding with confidence. Luckily I was only a mile and a half from home. Pedaled back gingerly & put my good floor pump onto the valve. The gauge said 30 psi.

A feature I find very helpful is its locking mechanism which prevents the pump from opening while riding.  A great feature as my previous pump did not have that.  It fits both conventional and Presto valves with a simple adjustment.  (My British Raleigh MTB, that I purchased in Asia, uses those freaky Presto valves.)

Yes, it gets a little warm when under heavy use. But, this is the only pump I currently own (will be buying a nicer floor pump soon), and I had a bit of an issue with flats last week (got 5 in just a couple days!). This little pump was the only thing I had to pump up my tubes with, and it did the job, if a bit inefficiently. It's a pain to pump a tire to rideable pressure multiple times with this thing, but that's likely more due to my lack of physical fitness than anything else. And the size of the thing. It's not designed to be your main pump, but it served that purpose quite well when I needed it to!

Mounts easily enough. Though my old bike (1980 Schwinn Traveler) doesn't have a single damn threaded hole in any of the tubes on the frame, so I've had to get inventive on how to install it. This now sits high on my seat's downtube, right in front of my rear wheel, right behind my ulock. It's attached with zip ties. And it's very secure. If you have a more modern bike, I'm sure you'll have no problems installing this little beaut.",06-04-2015

It does the job pumping the tire to high pressure. However, it takes a long time to pump the tire and requires some effort. The pump does not have a flexible tube, you attach one end to your valve and pump from the other end. When you pump with your one hand (I use my stronger right hand), you need to use the other hand to secure the end that is attached to the valve. You can imagine the amount of force that you need to pump a road bike tire (just think about a floor pump), and you repeat the pumping motion many times. I find it very difficult, if not impossible, to securely anchor the pump to the valve without exerting excessive force onto the valve itself. After I worked my ass off to pump the tire as hard as I can to prevent another pinch flat on the rest of my ride, I found my Presta valve bent like and """" instead of an ""i"".
I gave this pump a two star despite the bad design that is shared by many frame mounted mini pumps, which can easily bend a Presta valve. The bottom line is that such a bend does not seem to cause any air leak. And it might be possible for some one who is skilled to avoid such bending problem. If so, it would be nice to have some instructions on the package of the product that illustrates the correct way of using it.",04-20-2015

But, I found instructions online about how to use a similar pump on a schrader valve.
This pump works fine, actually.
What you do is to unscrew the cap on the pump most of the way.
Then push the pump head onto the valve.
Then, tighten the cap onto the pump head.
Then, you pull the lever back to lock the pump.
After you finish pumping,
Unlock the lever,
Unscrew the cap so it's loose on the valve.
Pull the pump head off the valve.
Screw the cap back onto the pump.
I'm glad to know it actually works well!
If you know the Secret.
I gave it 4 stars because they should tell you this Secret.",04-02-2015

To use on schrader (i.e. Fat tires) you need to follow the simple diagram on the package to reverse the valve head components.

To use the pump, you give the handle a slight turn clockwise to unlock it. Push the head firmly down on the valve  ( it helps to have a thumb on the bottom of the tire bracing the tire valve for support), then flip the lever UP and begin pumping. After done pumping, flip lever DOWN and pull the head off the tire valve ( it does require a GOOD tug to release.)

Road Bike: On my 700 x 25C tire bike, it worked pretty well. I keep these tires pumped to about 100-110 psi. With the tire deflated to 0 psi, it took me about 4 minutes to pump to about 80 psi. I would give it 5 stars here.

Mountain Bike: on my 27"" x 2.00"" tire bike, I usually like to keep these pumped to 50-55 psi. With the tire deflated to 0 psi, it took me about 10 minutes to pump to just barely 40 psi. These tires require more volume of air, and this pump is just barely adequate for the job here. Good enough  to keep you rolling again after some effort. Three stars here..

Since the spare pumps on both my bikes gave out recently, I ordered 2 of these: Kept one for the Road bike, send the other one back.",07-19-2014

I just happened to have a flat yesterday and was glad I had it. It gripped the Schrader valve well. It was easy ti use. It pumped smoothly. It cones with a nifty mount that fits under the water bottle mounting and lets it nestle beside the water bottle. The only fault that I found was that it has a small body diameter and it is not double acting. Because of that it does not move a lot of air. After over 100 strokes my 700x35  hybrid tire had barely enough air in it to ride to a air pump. That was enough but I am used to using a pump to fill a tire to its working  pressure and I would have to pump for a very long time to do that.,04-29-2014

It mounts easily on a bike frame, and will save the day in an emergency.
That said, you really don't want to have to use this pump.  Think of it as insurance: it provides protection for unforeseen emergencies, but you really don't want to use it.
Why?  Because inflating a tube with this small pump takes FOREVER.
I hate to be the one to break it to you, but there is no free lunch.  Whoever constructed the universe in which we live did not allow perfection to be admitted.  There is a rule in play that says, ""In order to gain something, you have to lose something.""  What you gain with this pump is extreme portability and light weight.  What you lose is a quick inflation of a flat.
I top my tires off at home with a nice, conventional, standup pump that has a built-in tire gauge.  It's quick, and almost effortless.  It is not, however, lightweight or portable.  And that's the way things are...there is ALWAYS a tradeoff.

1.  Buy the pump.  Carefully follow previous reviewers' instructions about converting it for Schrader valves.

2.  Stick the pump in your bike tool kit without thoroughly testing it first.  (Hey, I said this review is based on my experience.  I didn't say I was smart.)

3.  Experience a flat tire.

4.  Remove wheel and tire, patch or replace inner tube, put everything back together.  Pull out pump.

5.  Spend anywhere from five to thirty minutes, depending on your patience level, trying to latch the pump onto the valve securely enough to inflate the tire.  Push, shove, pull, yank, twist, slap, bang, jerk, wrestle, grunt, sweat, and implore the bike gods, which is problematic because they don't actually exist, all to no avail, because the pump WILL NOT seat on the valve well enough to actually pump in any air. (It is possible to jam it down on the valve stem so hard that you're afraid you'll never get it off again, but not possible to force any air through said valve stem.)

6.  Despite having followed previous reviewers' instructions exactly, suspect that you haven't assembled the pump correctly for Schrader valves.  Spend another five to thirty minutes, depending on your patience level, disassembling and reassembling the parts in every possible configuration, finally concluding that it was correct in the first place because no other configuration even looks like it might be right.

7.  Spend another five to thirty minutes pushing, shoving, pulling, yanking, twisting, slapping, banging, jerking, wrestling, grunting, sweating, and problematically imploring the bike gods, all to no avail, because the pump WILL NOT seat on the valve well enough to actually pump in any air.

8.  Give up.  Walk the bike home.  Get out your floor pump and inflate the tire in sixty seconds flat.

9.  Get on Amazon and read the reviews for a bunch of other portable tire pumps.  Order the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BV-11-High-Pressure-Micro-Floor-Pump-In-line-Gauge-140-psi-Reversible-Presta-Schrader-Long-Hose-Frame-Mount/dp/B003RR8GF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BV 11"" High Pressure Micro Floor Pump, In-line Gauge, 140 psi, Reversible Presta Schrader, Long Hose, Frame Mount</a>.

10. Decide to be smart this time and test the pump before a tire goes flat on the road.  Deflate a tire completely and pump it up again with the BV pump.  Discover that it works beautifully.  Dance for joy.

11. Get back on Amazon to write a scathing review of the Pocket Rocket and an enthusiastic review of the BV pump.

...Or, you know, you could skip steps 1-8 and just buy the BV pump in the first place.  Granted, it's a little heavier and bulkier than the Pocket Rocket, and a little more expensive, but I for one would rather carry a slightly heavier pump that will actually inflate a tire than walk all the way home with a lightweight pump and a flat tire I can't fix.",03-29-2014

One upgrade is a schrader valve instead if the manual hand pump.  The manual is short, difficult to grip esp in cold and on mine seems or be extremely difficult to pump, end up hammering it with fist to get it to go pressurize.  Needing like 40-60 pumps with this setup gets old. O ring upgrade seals well maybe too well, old leather washers previously were antiquated for sure design wise.

Anyway enough back ground use, I got pump today and tried it out on lantern.  Worked like a charm. I Finally see the pressure gauge move on lantern. It never moves with the old built in pump no matter how many times I pumped it.  This is a welcome addition to my kit.  I can even clamp it on while lantern is running without the pump draining any appreciable pressure from tank.  This is handy since long burn times of the lantern will need a ""refill"" of pressurized air.  Next stop cold weather camping.  Very happy with this pump and will likely add a second one for back up.  The pump has a diagram to switch from presta valve (factory default setting on mine).  Unscrew grey output ring. Pull Both black inserts out. Take apart reverse the way they are put together and reinsert with wider opening toward your bike or whatever uses schrader valves. Very simple.

That said I would likely not purchase again and would pay slightly more to get something that is undoubtedly universally known to fit most bikes. Also please note this and one of the other reviewers notes. When you purchase the pump, there is a plasticy tube inside the pump that you must flip around in order to get it to fit the air plugs on your bike. Do not try to immediately use as-is or you will be significantly frustrated (I thought I bought a total piece of garbage) but turns out it was only mildly disappointing due to my bike purchase.

Well I was out on the road and my tire was getting low and I went to use this and ended up having to Google a how to video on my phone to see how the heck the multiple pieces are supposed to go when you unscrew the cap. Yes, you are free to laugh at me. But the truth is, while this little thing is very well made and works very well...if you don't know what you're doing that very first time, you're going to be annoyed and possibly walking your bike home. There is a cap piece that screws off on the top. Inside that, there are two rubberish black pieces that come out. They can be positioned (or used one at a time) to accommodate various things you might want to inflate. However, for a bike with a normal everyday ""Schrader or American"" valve, you will need to position the black pieces correctly and then screw back on the out rim/cap for it to attain proper suction and actually work. So this is why reading the directions or watching a very quick ""how to ""video is very helpful before you actually need to use the device haha.

Are you kidding me?,"So I bought this thinking that it would work as an emergency pump when I'm out on the road. Don't get me wrong, for around $15, this pump is a good quality, lightweight yet solid mini pump. The plastic handle is solid and fits the hand rather well, and the body, which seems to be aluminum is also a solid construction. I've also always liked Topeak and own several of their prodcuts, but bear in mind that this is only about 9 inches long. In other words, it's tiny (read: IT'S TINY). What that means in terms of practicality is that it has none. First I tested it out by letting the air out of my bike tire and pumping it from close to zero psi. (By the way, the presta/schrader exchangeability is a nifty thing, but most of the bikes nowadays use presta, so it's not very useful except for quickly letting the air out with the schrader head on a presta tire, which is what I did.) I pumped for about 5 minutes while occasionally checking the tire pressure with the pinch test (and being disappointed each time) and trying to keep the pump fixed so that air wouldn't leak (it leaks constantly as the tire pressure increases) and what I realized was that even if I spent 30 minutes trying to pump my tire with this thing, it could never, ever, ever actually reach the standard 100 psi, let alone the advertised 160 psi. I put in a few more frustrating minutes pumping while sweating like a pig in my air-conditioned room (It was a workout! Really! Also, the aluminum body also gets really hot to the touch; don't know why) and to my utmost disappointment found out through the gauge on my floor pump that the pressure in my tire was around 40 psi. That's around 5 minutes of pumping for 40 psi. (READ: THAT'S AROUND 5 MINUTES OF PUMPING FOR 40 PSI.) And as you know pumping gets harder as the pressure increases, so if you're looking for a road pump that actually works, skip this one and get a longer one with much more air capacity.

They are not high-end, but they usually work well and are good for the price.

This one, however, is awful! Very poor design and hard to use. First, was figuring out how to switch it to the Schrader valve, which, thanks to fellow Amazon reviewers (and not Topeak) I was able to do. (You need to unscrew the gray cap and rearrange the inner black pieces.)

After switching to the Schrader valve set-up, it was VERY difficult to get this on and off the valve stems. I was really worried I would damage the tube (as I've now read others have done, completely ruining their tubes). I found that it is easier to unscrew the gray cap, put it on the stem; take the black rubber pieces out and put it on the valve stem; put pump onto black pieces; screw gray cap down; pump tube; reverse set-up instructions to remove....  Very lame and difficult, but if I don't do it that way I'm pretty sure I would destroy my valve stem and tube like others have done.

In shot, I'm sending this back and getting a different one.",06-22-2013

Simplified instructions.

I'm reading a lot of people are having a hard time with this pump.
I did also.
Here is a simple breakdown for you.

Step 1.
See if your valves are Presta or Schrader. Presta are narrow and skinny, while Schrader are the usual thicker kind.
If you have Presta the pump is already set to use on your bike.
If you have Schrader see step 2.

Step 2.
Unscrew the gray cap on the front with the plug in it.
Do you see the little switch on the back of the unit that is lying flat?
Push it up, it will force the little pieces out of the front.
Simply switch the front one around to get the Schrader side and shove both pieces back in the pump.

Step 3.
Screw the gray cover with the plug back on but leave just a TINY bit of wiggle room, don't screw it on tight.
I'll tell you why in a moment. If you're a Presta simply loosen it a little since yours never needed to be detached to begin with.

Step 4.
Unscrew the covers on your valves and wiggle the pump onto the valve.
The bottom of the pump you should turn counter clockwise and be able to pull the pump way down so you can pump air.

Step 5.
The little switch on the back should be pushed up and away from the pump to lock it on the bike valve.

Step 6.
Pump away but make sure you have a tire gauge so you don't over/under inflate.
The correct tire pressure (PSI) should be on your tires.
I had to grab a flashlight to locate mine.
And the pump should work smoothly, if the pump bounces back at you, you do not have a good connection. Follow step 7 and try again till you get a good connection.
The pump will move smoothly and not bounce back and you shouldn't hear air seeping out with each pump.
You'll know after a few pumps if the tire is any firmer.

Step 7.
When you are finished pumping...
This is one where people are having a lot of trouble.
Push the lever on the back of the pump back down.
If you start pulling, twisting etc... it will be very difficult to remove the pump.
This is why I said to leave the gray cap a little loose.
Turn it counter clockwise just enough and it will wiggle the pump loose from the valve with zero effort.
I hope this helps.

Good pump, good price.
A must for bike riders, recommended.",04-10-2013

I live way out in the country and hate getting stuck out in the middle of nowhere with a flat. Thanks to a nice video on the Topeak website I was able to quickly adjust the pieces to work with a schrader valve. It mounted nicely and unobtrusively on my mountain bike. I ride with my tires inflated to around 60 psi, and although it takes a little work to get there, it's a small inconvenience and to be expected because of the short stroke of the unit.

The big problem I had was that I didn't read the packaging carefully and assumed the lock position for the lever was down, but it's really up. This is clearly stated on the packaging but I managed to overlook it and hence didn't get a good seal for inflating and also had difficulty when removing the pump from the tire because I was flipping the lever up and had it in the lock position. D'oh!

So I've amended my review to four stars, and may give it the fifth star after I get out on the road and can judge how securely the pump stays in the holder, how durable it is, and how the cap works against mud and dirt.",03-08-2013

I kept pumping until I felt some noticeable resistance and when I took a reading with a pressure gauge (a separate gauge, since this one doesn't have one) it was around 85 PSI. This is after the fact that some air gets released as I try and put the gauge on the valve. So with this, I'll say that this pump could put around 85-90 PSI on a 700cx23 tire pretty easily. Anything past that is definitely doable, but it would take some effort. Also, when using this pump, only do slow, but deliberate and firm strokes in order to avoid a fast heat build-up. Oh and as far locking the head of the pump, if the little lever is parallel to the body of the pump, that is the UNLOCK position. Pulling it is the LOCK position, thus engaging the pump and making it ready for pumping.

As far as installing it my bike's frame, it's as if it wasn't even there. The only time it actually made contact with my leg was when I wore a very baggy pair of sweatpants. this was fixed by turning the pump so that the locking lever is what's facing me, instead of the rubber dust cap. Also, the packaging came with its own bolts that you can either use or out away as spares.

I have only used this on Presta valve. Like other reviewers have pointed out, the only instructions provided in the packaging on how to use this on Schrader valves were pictures of an exploded view of the components of the head of the pump.

All in all, this is a good pump. It would be nice if it had a gauge, but I don't find that to be a deal breaker. Take a good look at the packaging and its pictures of ""instructions"" before using, especially the lock/unlock part.",01-18-2013

The one thing that seriously annoyed me when I got it is that it comes with no instruction booklet (only some vague pictorial instructions printed on the card that it's zip-tied to) and I had no idea why it wasn't fitting onto my bike tire. Yeah yeah, call me a newb, but I had to look at other amazon reviews to realize you had to actually dis-assemble the tip and jam the two little plastic pieces together in the unique orientation that matches your kind of tire (all the while trying not to drop them on the floor lest they roll away forever under some kitchen appliance) without much guide as to which way around you should put them together. I went through that kerfuffle all over again when a friend's tire went flat during a ride, and his tire was different from mine, and I didn't have the little card handy -- I must have tried every configuration twice. Well if you're more experienced with tires and pump attachments than I, maybe this wouldn't be your experience, but it's worth keeping in mind. And yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, it really does take a good deal of pumping (I always take off my jacket beforehand so I don't get too warm <-- dude this is a really important step, it's kind of like an arm-based cardio workout). Also sometimes it's really hard to fit it right onto the tire. I know what you're thinking... that I haven't said anything positive about it and I've still given it four stars. Well, I mean it is SO light and SO small that I forget to take it out of my messenger bag when I'm not biking, and it really is meant to be used as an on-the-road stop gap measure and since bikes are transportation for me rather than dedicated bike rides where I go out and then come back home... I don't want to tote around a full-sized bike pump. And it's so cheap! And it comes with a little rack that you can mount to your bike to stick it in but DON'T DO IT if you're going to leave your bike somewhere because if I were a thief I would totally steal it from you. Anyway yeah, I like it, and recognize that aside from the inexcusable lack of instructions, the only reason it bugs me is because I'm using it as my sole bike pump.",01-13-2013

I consider myself handy with tools and equipment.  This however wasn't intuitive to use at first.

1) The schrader valve ""option"" is not set at the factory.  You have to disassemble the head area and flip the black piece to switch it from Presto to Scrader.

2) On 99% of pumps the ""lock"" position is down on the clamp.  This is opposite for this pump.  You have to pull the lever away from the pump to get into the ""T"" position to lock it in place.  I find that unscrewing the gray cap, sliding it over the valve, and then screwing back onto the pump works best.

3)At first I thought this pump was hard to use because it required a lot of muscle to pressurize.  I actually had it set up wrong.  When properly pumping, it should be really easy with little to no resistance and your tire should fill up in no time.

4)The little strap that hold the pump onto the clamp is an oring.  Don't lose it!  Although I imagine it would still require lots of force for the pump to dislodge from the clamp without it.",12-09-2012

No problem keeping my tires at 70 lbs. Construction seems good.  Be careful when you first set it up.  It has a rubber insert that has to be positioned properly depending on whether you have Schrader or Presta valves. The instructions are ambiguous. Also, I have trouble with the pump fitting too tightly on my valve stem (Schrader). Getting it on is OK but difficult to remove. Note that the screw cap covering the rubber piece that fits over the valve controls how tight the pump fits on the valve. You can loosen this cap to make it easier to remove the pump but that lets out air. Hard to find the right balance. One other thing that might not be obvious: the lever on the back of the pump should be folded down when inserting and removing the pump. It should be up to hold it securely on the valve. This is opposite to what some other pumps do.

If used for a a racing or road bike with very small tires that require a high pressure. My low rating is here to help those who might accidentally buy it for a hybrid or mountain bike.

This thing is not capable of filling up tires in hybrid bikes or mountain bikes. Even using a skinnier tire (35mm) this pump failed to pump at all even after several minutes of trying. In fact, I LOST tire pressure. I took it in to a bike shop, thinking the pump was broken, and the employee showed me the error of my ways.

So if you are trying to fill up a hybrid or mountain bike, pass on this pump. If you want to fill up a road bike, this pump is amazing.

I should mention that I now have a racing bike. For kicks, I pulled this guy out of the ""Donate to goodwill"" box that I started but never donated, and tried it out on my bike. It worked great, and I got up to a good pressure without much effort. The tires used Presta valves btw.",11-06-2012

One minor downside is the lack of pressure check gauge, but once you realize this pump is not really meant to be your main one (you should have a proper floor pump at home with a gauge) it is not a problem. Also, many avid bikers suggest to use your hand/thumb to check tire pressure while on road, since pressure gauges for the Presta valve are notoriously inaccurate.

**Revision**
Okay... after watching numerous online videos describing how to use this pump, I finally got it to work with the Schrader valve set-up. It takes alot of pumping to get from 0 psi. to 100 psi. but it does work.  I do like how lite it is and how it mounts under the water bottle holder. I think I will be able to use this on the road when I have nothing else.  Otherwise I will be using my air compressor at home.",07-27-2012

Like other reviewers have said, it takes more than a few pumps to get your tires full. I don't care, it takes more energy to cycle than it does to pump up the bike, so I say man up and deal with it. (We all know most cyclists need to focus on their upper body strength anyway XD) It also does get a little warm while you pump, but it's nothing to worry about. I like that it comes with a water bottle mount, it's pretty convenient. Just remember to take it with you if you park outside somewhere so no one steals it!

Now the main reason that I knocked off a star was because, like a couple of other reviewers have mentioned, it does not come with instructions on how to change the valve to what you need to be. There is a basic (meaning absolutely basic) illustration on the front of the packaging that gives you an idea of what you have to do. I will try to give some crappy instructions, so follow closely:

You need to unscrew the gray rubber cab off the top, on the other side of the lock lever. Once you have it off, you will need to somehow pull or knock out the black rubber/plastic piece. Pull that piece apart and arrange it so that it will fit your the valve for your bike. When you have it fitted correctly, just put the black assembly back into the pump and screw the gray cap back on. It should work fine, it did for me. But it took me a little bit to figure out what I needed to do. For anyone who isn't slightly mechanically inclined, it could end up a little bit of a headache, enough so that I decided that it was worth it to knock off a star.

As for it tearing the valve out of your tube, it did not do that for me. It did have monster grip on it though, but I guess that's one of the reasons it gets you better tire pressure. :)  It takes a little bit of effort and patience to get it off you valve, but just be easy and take it slow and it'll come off without breaking anything.

All in all it's a good pump that does what it says, it'll get you higher pressure than most other mini pumps will give you. If you can figure out how to change the valve fitting to work with your bike, then it's good to go!",07-06-2012

The thing I really like about the pump is not just the dust resistant cap, but that it will inflate tubes that are both Schrader and Presta valves.  Presta valves are usually on narrow wheels tubes.  Schrader valves are usually on mountain bike wheels.  If your rims are drilled for Presta valves, you can't use a tube that has a Schrader valve (won't fit through the hole).  The beauty with the Pocket Rocket is that it can be used on both types of valves.  So your buddies tires and yours can be inflated if they are different.  Plus, look at the price.

It takes me less than a minute to inflate a bicycle tire from completely flat to 65 PSI (what I keep mine at) and my tires are big (mountain bike).
People complaining that it gets hot? Of course it gets it is an air pump.

However, I can see how the lack of instructions frustrates some people.

To save you all the time, here is how you use it:

Unscrew the grey cap. Thread it into the tire's valve (you will screw it back to the pump at the end). Pull out the rubber cylinder and the plastic valve behind it. Rotate the pump's plastic valve to fit your tire's valve and put it back in the pump. Screw the rubber cylinder onto your tire's valve and thread the pump into the cylinder. Screw the grey cap back onto the pump. Lift up the latch in the back to ""lock"" the pump, which also presses the pump's valve into the tire's valve to open up the air flow. Begin pumping.

It sounds complicated but it is not. Maybe the first time you use it, but afterwords you realize that the design is good and very sturdy.

Quality is more than O.K. for the money.

I doubt it can reach 160 PSI but don't forget this is a BICYCLE pump. Don't buy this for your car and expect it to be able to push that type of PSI. Even if the pump can, you most likely cannot exert enough force to reach the max PSI.",03-19-2012

My impression is... 5-stars. As others have said, the pump is incredibly well made. I can't remember the last time I made a $16 purchase of anything that was more than a throwaway, a consumable or an utter disappointment.

As has been noted in these revews, the instructions are cryptic, needlessly so! The only possible complication is the one that the instructions treat pretty abstractly. In fairness, there is a diagram on the packaging material that illustrates (without a single word in any language) how to flip the internal needle valve so that the pump will work with either valve type (Schrader or Presta). But... a sentence of notice, or better yet, description would have been in order. And yet, flip the packaging material over and there in four languages (none English!) are the pump's specifications.

I purchased the model that has a very convenient built in pressure gauge, which I very much recommend. The pump applies pressure on both the down and withdrawal stroke, so the rather small capacity of the tube is effectively doubled. I found my tiers were at about 35 psi (blush). With 60-70 strokes I was able to bring them to 65 psi. The pump specs claim that it is capable of 120 psi.

The built-in gauge model mounts the pressure gauge on the bottom of the pump barrel, so it helps to rotate the tire with the valve stem upward, then connect and lock the pump to the valve. In this orientation, the gauge can be read while working the pump. To lock and seal the pump there is a very effective lever-lock mechanism that seals the fitting between pump and valve - no leaks thereafter. Pump to pressure then a quick flip of the lever unlocks the pump with only the faintest hiss of a bit of air loss as the internal needle releases.

The pump weighs 158 gr. (5.5 oz). It may be mounted along with an existing water-bottle holder, using the same holes & screws. The pump's detachable, mounting base contains at least three sets of hole patterns to match most existing templates (two screws are included if drilling and threading is needed. Once secured with the screws, the pump then very securely clips to its base and has a velcro strap to doubly secure the pump.

If you regularly fill a tire from completely deflated, a larger capacity pump will be less work. But for an occasional flat, or more regular topping-off of the tire's pressure - this pump can't be beaten... especially at the price point. Riding with fully inflated tiers is now easily done and certainly worth the price.",12-15-2011

It's okay.  Works great for emergencies and wider tires.  Sure, specs say up to 160 psi, but who are we fooling here?  After 80 psi you better be really strong.  My biggest problem with this is the higher psi you approach it gets awkward/difficult to operate.  In an emergency, on a road bike, it will get your tire inflated enough to ride to a floor pump, but don't rely on it as a primary pump or even to 'top off' your pressure.

I'm glad mine got stolen. It gave me the ""opportunity"" to purchase a Lezyne micro floor pump, which is 3x more expensive, but 3x more worth it, and 3x more likely to get stolen. D'oh.",11-26-2011

No, it's not made to be your only pump as it provides a low volume of air, but in case of emergency, this thing is your lifesaver.  My only criticism is the rubber cap that encloses the air tip because it basically serves no purpose since it never stays closed.

Upon initial inspection, it really looks like a well-constructed product. The aluminum body is quite light, seems durable and the silver color shouldn't have a problem coordinating with really any color scheme. The valve stem locking mechanism seems solid, too.
The multiple valve options (Schraeder/Presta/Dunlop) definitely are a nice touch. I've just started getting into road biking - my gf picked me up a '73 Schwinn Varsity from a yard sale - and the tubes in it use Schraeder valves. I assume I'll upgrade bikes/wheels/tubes at some point along the road (no pun intended), and didn't want to have to needlessly spend money on a different pump if different tubes are purchased. You'll need to do some adjustments with the plastic bits inside the head to switch between the 3, but that didn't take more than a couple minutes of adjusting around to figure out.
As other reviewers have stated, this isn't aimed at being your primary bike pump (the small canister obviously lacks the capacity of a standing pump or air compressor), but if you're out biking and get a flat, this works exactly as it should. The only feature I can think of that could make it better would be a small pressure gauge, but that's just being nit picky. Any rider should be able to use this to pump their tire to adequate riding pressure with ease, at the very least until they're able to find a higher capacity, higher speed pump.
I ordered this with a couple other items that qualified for free super-saver shipping. Shipping took just shy of 2 weeks, which was a bit of a let down since bike-riding season is quickly coming to a close. It was, however, a nice surprise when the items arrived at my doorstep, as the tracking number I was given had not even been updated beyond ""we have received notice to expect this shipment..."" by the time it arrived. But that's more a review of USPS than the product lol.",10-24-2011

I let a bit of air out of my tire and went to connect the pump to the valve stem... No go. Didn't create a seal. The pump head didn't seem to be wide enough to ""go around"" the whole valve... Hmm..

So I check the VERY sparse directions, which are actually not directions at all, but semi-vague diagrams that only become clear after you understand what they mean.

From the look of the diagrams, I had to open the pump head and flip this little plastic piece around. No go. Still nothing...

Then I went to the Topeak website and checked out the video they have posted. [...] Mystery solved. The plastic piece comes apart, at which point you turn the two halves around and plug them into each other - poof! Like magic, it fits and my tire is inflated again.

Haven't used this on the road yet, but it certainly re-inflated my tire with no problems. The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is that if you are not a bike aficionado, you might not know about different valve types (I didn't) and not realize that the plastic piece comes apart. Basically, poor directions. But the product seems solid and functions as it should.

NOTE: In the video the two halves of the plastic piece are different colors (one red, one black) -- mine were both black, so it was not easy to see that it comes apart.

Will update this review if I run into any problems.

UPDATE: Just wanted to report that I recently took the opportunity to pump up both of my tires from near flat to 45psi and I was able to do it with this pump without any issues at all. Was it as easy as using an electric pump? Definitely not, but it was not hard either - and it is now reassuring to know I can do this ""in the wild"" if the situation ever presents itself.",09-28-2011

The rubber strap that holds it in place on the holder seems strong and yet has the necessary elasticity to hold its tautness for a long time. Unfortunately, I cannot imagine how the manufacturer concluded that there was no need for even the briefest of instructions: Most importantly, how to convert the tip from the default Presta valve use to what most people have known since they were kids (but didn't know the name), the Schrader valve. The pump came attached to a piece of cardboard, but the cardboard had not one sentence of instruction printed on it. I was so baffled as to how this pump works that I carried it on my bike for months just hoping I would never have to use it. I thought maybe it simply wasn't every going to work with my tires, but it was too late to return it. Finally after almost becoming stranded with an extremely low tire about five miles from home, when I got back I did a google search using a few key words, and came upon a review here that described it in words how to convert the tip.

A few notes based on my minor use:
* There's no gauge on the pump. I didn't realize this, but bought it for mountain bike emergencies so I can inflate by feel. If you need a gauge you should buy the Mini G Blaster which is a little heavier, but has a gauge, and a dual-action pumper so you're inflating on the compression AND return of the pump action. Seems like a better product overall.
* You need to make sure to really shove the bike valve into the pump head. You're pressing it through a rubber seal and it requires a little force to seat the valve stem all the way in, particularly for Presta valves.
* You need to make sure to hold/secure the head while pumping so you don't push the valve around too much, though I can't say from personal experience if you can actually break the valve while pumping, but it seemed like a good idea to hold onto the pump head and the tire to keep it from wiggling around while pumping.
* The handle will get hot after a few minutes of pumping.

Hopefully I won't have to use this again. :) I have a floor pump for pumping at the house which is obviously MUCH easier to use. Your feet hold it steady, has a huge gauge, so much easier overall.",06-13-2011

I had to return the first pair because they were far too large. I typically wear 10-10.5 shoes, so I ordered the respective size. Afterward I saw they suggested getting a size lower, so I bought the next size down. There is still too much space in the foot (occasionally they still want to slip off on flip turns). Likewise, since they're loose, it will bend at the arch of my foot, causing some extra pressure that is more likely to cause a cramp while swimming.

Otherwise the short fins have a nice length.",12-03-2016

Big problem. Had to order two sizes smaller. SEE UPDATE!,"Well designed and well made BUT the sizing is WAY off. I'm a skinny triathlete and runner. I wear a 10.5 or 11 size running shoe. I ordered the 8.5 to 9 size (one size down) fin and it was loose. I could still swim with them and they didn't fall off, but they were moving around too much for my taste. They were too wide and too long. So I sent them back and ordered the next size down (two sizes smaller than what they recommend). I'll update the review when I test those.

My previous fins were were some older heavy duty Speedo fins (very generic) and these are much better. I'm using these to enhance my swim workouts, gain some ankle flexibility and perfect my upper body form. No recreational use. They worked very well in the water doing laps and flip turns. Great quality. Perfect workout fin for my application. Certainly more of a workout fin than a scuba or diving fin. Highly recommend but you need to deal with the size problem.

UPDATE TO SIZE: Okay...as noted earlier I had some sizing/fit issues. I sent the previous size back and ordered up the same fin in a U.S. size 7-8 (Euro 41/42) and they fit P-E-R-F-E-C-T-L-Y!!!! Again, I wear a running shoe in a 10.5 or 11. I'm tall and skinny.",08-18-2016

They come with a mesh carrying case, though I usually use an enclosed bag when I take them to the gym so they don't drip all over the floor. They fit true to size- they are just snug enough to stay on my feet without being difficult to put on or take off. I usually put them on my feet when I am already in the pool and have had no problems using one hand to slip them on. They do definitely make a difference in my swimming speed.

These are absolutely perfect for all those reasons.

Pros: they're slightly weighed down by their design meaning you won't get inverted in the water by overly buoyant flippers, which is something I've had a lot of trouble with in the past.
They're so incredibly well built, that I don't notice even a hint of wear and tear even with pool use. With previous flippers I'd bought, after hour in the pool they're were starting to fray and fall apart at the tips.
So comfortable! I have no fear of them falling off, plus they're not causing blisters or tightness, which I thought they might.

Cons: They will make your calves, thighs and feet feel sore. They are not meant for leisure in my opinion, these are true training fins. They're meant to build you up, not make swimming easier.
Not a fan of the open toe, it feels strange in the water. Adds a whole lot of drag (but then again, that's what is making it a better resistance fin). I think they if you wore a scuba sock it would take care of that added drag.
Did not come with carrying case. For such beautifully made fins, I'd have expected some form of carrying case or bag to go with them.

Overall:
Would buy a million times over. Has made my workout exactly what I wanted it to be!",04-20-2016

I wear a women's size 8 medium shoe. Based on a woman's answer to a size question on these fins, I ordered a size 8 (she said is her size, and they fit beautifully). They were huge; I'm guessing they were a men's size 8, so the comment was off base IMO. So, I returned the size 8, and ordered the next size down as is now recommended in the description.

Much to my disappointment, the next size down also didn't work. One fin fit OK, not really snug, but may have worked. The other was loose, so wouldn't have worked well in the water.

As I stated earlier, I really liked and wanted these fins, but it's too difficult to get the right size, which led to the two-star rating. Now I'll try and find my fins locally since it appears many of the fins sizes are men's sizes.",04-26-2015

I typically wear a US size 10 (men's) for my shoe size, and I intentionally ordered these larger because I knew I would be swimming with them while wearing neoprene wetsuit booties. If you were a size ten shoe in men's, I would definitely go smaller unless you are planning to swim while wearing something inside of them. For my purposes, they fit perfectly. Not too tight, and not too loose. They are easy to swim with, and while they don't provide as much propulsion as a bigger fin, they are much easier on the legs.

The ONLY thing to be aware of with these fins is that they are SHORTER than most flippers.  They're better than no flippers but they're not as good as those big long floppy ones as far as power goes.  So it really depends on what your intended usage will be if you get these or a pair with longer blades.

I preferred the size for packing for a trip since they didn't take a ton of room in my suitcase, but when I was out in the ocean I got a little tired quicker than I expected because of the lack of power due to the length.

I had delayed trying these on due to recovery from surgery.  I had gone swimming without them a few times. When I finally had the courage to try them on, I was really impressed!  They do a really great job activating muscle groups that help you propel through the water, and with much less effort in comparison to being without them.  After swimming without these, I could barely walk.  Then when I tried these while swimming I was amazed at how little effort was needed to get through the water, and had no issues walking afterwards.  I did feel new muscle groups being used and am hopeful that they will help to make healing that much quicker from my surgery.  The addition of the bag was really great too.  It is a good sized nylon mess bag.",07-10-2014

These would likely also be great for snorkeling, and they are very short and light, a huge plus for travel. You do sacrifice some speed for the size, but it's worth it IMO (though I would use my scuba fins for anything more than a hundred feet off shore). I would definitely buy these again.

The challenge is that sizing info is all over the map and peoples reviews don't include that. SO, mine will. I usually wear a man's 7.5-8, depending on the size of the shoe. These said 7-8 and were decidedly big. I fitted them with some 1/4 closed cell foam and that made them more useable, but a smaller size would have been better. I chose this size as fins at the pool, in the 7-8 size were a perfect fit for me. Each brand seems to size a bit differently.

For the most part I am satisfied with the fins in the water, although I would say they are a bit to stiff. I was hoping that with some wear they would loosed up, but this has not been the case.

Sizing on the other hand leave much to be desired. I typically wear a men's size 9.5-10.0 shoe and purchased the 8.5-9.5 fins. Upon purchase, I noticed the fins are labeled 43-44 (European), which I have found typically translates to a 9.5 to 10 or sometimes a 10 to 11 shoe size in the U.S. Still the length of the fins are not altogether that far off. the width however is considerably looser than desired - I would expect they fit an individual with wide(er) feet. I tend to wear standard width shoes with a bias towards narrower fits. The loose fit causes me to experience foot cramping very quickly in open water. I bought a pair of 3mm fin socks and paired the two together. With the socks, the fins really seemed to hit a groove. They were much more comfortable and did not cause any cramping (90+ minutes of continuous use in open water).

Conclusion: fit seems to be the biggest issue with these fins. If you can find a good size for you, they can be great travel fins. I would just prefer a bit more flex in the fin blade.",08-22-2011

I had to return the first pair because they were far too large. I typically wear 10-10.5 shoes, so I ordered the respective size. Afterward I saw they suggested getting a size lower, so I bought the next size down. There is still too much space in the foot (occasionally they still want to slip off on flip turns). Likewise, since they're loose, it will bend at the arch of my foot, causing some extra pressure that is more likely to cause a cramp while swimming.

Otherwise the short fins have a nice length.",12-03-2016

Big problem. Had to order two sizes smaller. SEE UPDATE!,"Well designed and well made BUT the sizing is WAY off. I'm a skinny triathlete and runner. I wear a 10.5 or 11 size running shoe. I ordered the 8.5 to 9 size (one size down) fin and it was loose. I could still swim with them and they didn't fall off, but they were moving around too much for my taste. They were too wide and too long. So I sent them back and ordered the next size down (two sizes smaller than what they recommend). I'll update the review when I test those.

My previous fins were were some older heavy duty Speedo fins (very generic) and these are much better. I'm using these to enhance my swim workouts, gain some ankle flexibility and perfect my upper body form. No recreational use. They worked very well in the water doing laps and flip turns. Great quality. Perfect workout fin for my application. Certainly more of a workout fin than a scuba or diving fin. Highly recommend but you need to deal with the size problem.

UPDATE TO SIZE: Okay...as noted earlier I had some sizing/fit issues. I sent the previous size back and ordered up the same fin in a U.S. size 7-8 (Euro 41/42) and they fit P-E-R-F-E-C-T-L-Y!!!! Again, I wear a running shoe in a 10.5 or 11. I'm tall and skinny.",08-18-2016

I usually put them on my feet when I am already in the pool and have had no problems using one hand to slip them on. They do definitely make a difference in my swimming speed.

They're so incredibly well built, that I don't notice even a hint of wear and tear even with pool use. With previous flippers I'd bought, after hour in the pool they're were starting to fray and fall apart at the tips.
So comfortable! I have no fear of them falling off, plus they're not causing blisters or tightness, which I thought they might.

Cons: They will make your calves, thighs and feet feel sore. They are not meant for leisure in my opinion, these are true training fins. They're meant to build you up, not make swimming easier.
Not a fan of the open toe, it feels strange in the water. Adds a whole lot of drag (but then again, that's what is making it a better resistance fin). I think they if you wore a scuba sock it would take care of that added drag.
Did not come with carrying case. For such beautifully made fins, I'd have expected some form of carrying case or bag to go with them.

Overall:
Would buy a million times over. Has made my workout exactly what I wanted it to be!",04-20-2016

I purchased the recommended size but they do seem a tad small I'm not sure if this is because the fins are made to go on either foot or if a I needed a half size larger (which I don't think is possible ).I'm probably being picky but I do feel like they would be more comfortable if they made left and right footed fins and specific sizes instead of a range.

I wear a women's size 8 medium shoe. Based on a woman's answer to a size question on these fins, I ordered a size 8 (she said is her size, and they fit beautifully). They were huge; I'm guessing they were a men's size 8, so the comment was off base IMO. So, I returned the size 8, and ordered the next size down as is now recommended in the description.

Much to my disappointment, the next size down also didn't work. One fin fit OK, not really snug, but may have worked. The other was loose, so wouldn't have worked well in the water.

As I stated earlier, I really liked and wanted these fins, but it's too difficult to get the right size, which led to the two-star rating. Now I'll try and find my fins locally since it appears many of the fins sizes are men's sizes.",04-26-2015

I typically wear a US size 10 (men's) for my shoe size, and I intentionally ordered these larger because I knew I would be swimming with them while wearing neoprene wetsuit booties. If you were a size ten shoe in men's, I would definitely go smaller unless you are planning to swim while wearing something inside of them. For my purposes, they fit perfectly. Not too tight, and not too loose. They are easy to swim with, and while they don't provide as much propulsion as a bigger fin, they are much easier on the legs. They also don't stir up as much sediment if you are going to be snorkeling somewhere sandy due to the smaller size.

The ONLY thing to be aware of with these fins is that they are SHORTER than most flippers.  They're better than no flippers but they're not as good as those big long floppy ones as far as power goes.  So it really depends on what your intended usage will be if you get these or a pair with longer blades.

I preferred the size for packing for a trip since they didn't take a ton of room in my suitcase, but when I was out in the ocean I got a little tired quicker than I expected because of the lack of power due to the length.  They weren't as difficult to walk in since they weren't so long though.",11-14-2014

I had delayed trying these on due to recovery from surgery.  I had gone swimming without them a few times. When I finally had the courage to try them on, I was really impressed!  They do a really great job activating muscle groups that help you propel through the water, and with much less effort in comparison to being without them.  After swimming without these, I could barely walk.  Then when I tried these while swimming I was amazed at how little effort was needed to get through the water, and had no issues walking afterwards.  I did feel new muscle groups being used and am hopeful that they will help to make healing that much quicker from my surgery.  The addition of the bag was really great too.  It is a good sized nylon mess bag.",07-10-2014

These said 7-8 and were decidedly big. I fitted them with some 1/4 closed cell foam and that made them more useable, but a smaller size would have been better. I chose this size as fins at the pool, in the 7-8 size were a perfect fit for me. Each brand seems to size a bit differently.

For the most part I am satisfied with the fins in the water, although I would say they are a bit to stiff. I was hoping that with some wear they would loosed up, but this has not been the case.

Sizing on the other hand leave much to be desired. I typically wear a men's size 9.5-10.0 shoe and purchased the 8.5-9.5 fins. Upon purchase, I noticed the fins are labeled 43-44 (European), which I have found typically translates to a 9.5 to 10 or sometimes a 10 to 11 shoe size in the U.S. Still the length of the fins are not altogether that far off. the width however is considerably looser than desired - I would expect they fit an individual with wide(er) feet. I tend to wear standard width shoes with a bias towards narrower fits. The loose fit causes me to experience foot cramping very quickly in open water. I bought a pair of 3mm fin socks and paired the two together. With the socks, the fins really seemed to hit a groove. They were much more comfortable and did not cause any cramping (90+ minutes of continuous use in open water).

Conclusion: fit seems to be the biggest issue with these fins. If you can find a good size for you, they can be great travel fins. I would just prefer a bit more flex in the fin blade.",08-22-2011

It just looks/feels like a high quality product... The same feeling I have when I hold a brand new Snap-on ratchet or a Zippo - - Made in USA for sure... It has a quick dampening time, so pointer levels out in a couple seconds, and doesn't act erratic while holding it. I don't have steady hands, and my hands shake more than most people... So it's been useful to use Brunton style compasses with a level... And while trying to maintain level, even decent compasses will oscillate more than a I'd like... This one doesn't need a lvel,and will stay steady when rotating bezel as well.
The instructions that come with it are good... When I taught myself to use a compass years ago, I did so with a pdf of this exact guide.
It doesn't seem as distracted by electronics as much as other compasses... it's induction dampening is crucial... Liquid dampening compasses are for busters.

Solid stable feel, with all of the features (other than declination adjustment) that anybody could need in a compass.  And, since I won't be guiding artillery fire or air attacks, nor coordinating efforts with other units speed isn't an issue.  I will take my time and do the declination adjustment in my head, and adjust accordingly.

Absolutely. Is it easy to read? Definitely. Is it accurate? 100%. Is it a bit over-kill if you're not using it to measure the distance and trajectory for firing mortars, shells, and other ammunition into an enemy base at night? Of course. Do I love it? Damn right I do.

Ok, I realize that this is way over-kill for the average outdoorsman and camper, and unless you're in active-duty military and currently serving in a war-zone or hostile territory, you're not going to be able to fully utilize everything this compass is capable of helping you to accomplish. Silva compasses are fantastic tools and work just fine, those are the kinds I've had and used for most of my life and I do endorse them. I still have my first one from over 20 years ago and it works without any problems. However, I just couldn't help myself with this one, they're just so...cool. These are the perfect tool for when you're hiking. Now, since I am not active military, I do not have any night-time engagements planned (It can be incredibly dangerous to hike through the woods at night, so I avoid it where possible), so this is why I went for the phosphorescent as opposed to the H3 luminescence. H3 has a half-life of about 12.3 years, so it's brightness will fade in about 10 years or so (same as this one). Since I don't need it to always be glowing (and you can't have the H3 replaced or anything), I decided to go for the cheaper option. If you're looking at buying one of these for a loved one currently serving in the military, go for the H3, I'm sure they will get more use out of it than a weekend warrior, such as myself. Oh, and as of writing this, these compasses are made in Dearborn, MI. Cheers.",01-21-2016

I couldn't bring myself to buy one of the many very cheap compasses I found while searching for the right compass. I settled on this one because it has everything I learned on in the military, without making me grit my teeth as I click purchase.

First of all, yes this is made of plastic, but not the plastic you are going to first think of. The plastic is a very dense and durable material. It just feels sturdy and well made. It can take a beating, but a compass should never be subjected to a beating. You pull it out, gear your bearing, and tuck it away until you need it again. Don't go trying to pound your tent stakes in with this, or any compass you decide on. If you use common sense, this will last you as long as you need it to, unless you lose it.

I can't comment on how bright this will stay or how easy it will be to read at night in pitch black... But if you can't see anything at all, it would be unsafe to travel in such lighting anyway, and if you have a flashlight then it doesn't matter how bright this gets.

The carrying case it comes in is basically exactly like what you would find at an Army Surplus outlet. It is that thin green water proof material. Not my favorite material, but makes this compass remind me even more of the one I had in the military.

For the price point of this item you can't go wrong. It isn't so cheap that it makes you question it's quality, but it isn't so expensive that you have to skimp on your other survival gear to get it. This will be all the compass you will need for whatever it is you are doing. I would recommend this to anyone in the market for a quality compass.",11-12-2015

I believe Cammenga's quality control may be slipping.  The compass is capable of resolving in between the lines.  With careful use of the lens avoiding parallax errors, one can easily resolve angles as small as 10 milliradians.  However, using surveyor bench mark I have had only one out of three read correctly.  The worst was off by 40mils (returned it and they replaced it with a capsule that was off by 20mils). And now I finally have one that is dead naught on.  So I would say your accuracy is the luck of the draw.  It is possible to compensate for these errors if you require this kind of precision from your unit.  However, it annoys me to have a fudge factor.  That being said, error in magnetic declination can easily swallow that small compass manufacturing error.  Even taking a bearing 10 feet away from an automobile can cause a deflection as much as 40mils.  That out of the way, there is no other compass that is as rugged and nearly indestructible as the Cammenga.  If your depend on your compass in life/death situations this would be the best back up compass.  However, in hypothermic conditions your brain becomes more prone to mistakes when doing math, so the first compass I would recommend is a high quality base plate (protractor) compass that allows you to set and forget magnetic declination.  They are not as precise, but much easier to use under extreme cold and mental fog.

It's metal just about everywhere, it has bright phosphorescence, an easy to read dial, and a clear sight.  I love it.

That said, this is my second compass.  The one that I initially received had a shorter lens bracket for some reason, which meant that it couldn't fold over on top of the bezel; it could only lean against it at about a 45 angle.  Of course, this meant that the clamshell couldn't be closed fully.  So I sent it back to Cammenga (a simple process after an email with a description of the problem, and they paid the shipping costs) and I got a replacement a few weeks later.

The new one still seems to be off, but only by a millimeter or two.  The lens bracket doesn't lie completely flat because it hits the edge of the bezel, and this means that the compass can't quite close 100% (see photos).  It's close enough though (and way better than the one I returned), and doesn't interfere with the operation of the compass.  I am curious as to whether the rubbing against the bezel will mean that I'll be seeing wear spots on it at some point.

You should spend more.

This thing is very cool.  It is very accurate, dampens quickly and lets you shoot accurate bearings very quickly once you get the hang of how to use it.  Yes, it isn't the lightest compass out there, but that is because it is built like a tank.  The whole thing is just extremely high quality.  Given that I am just a hiker and backpacker - I expect it will last me the rest of my life, easily.  Given what a vital piece of kit a compass is - I am perfectly ok with the weight/size/quality trade-off.

I agree with the other reviewers that there is really no need to spend more for tritium.  If you are thinking this will work like the luminescent hands of your wristwatch - glow very dimly for a few minutes and then go out, you are in for a nice surprise.

I hit it with nothing more powerful than a hiking headlamp at close range for a few seconds.  It glowed so brightly you could read the entire dial.  It stayed that way for several minutes.  Eventually the glow lowered down so you can only see the glowing bits - but that includes everything you need to use the compass, including being able to read bearing numbers off the dial and even shoot new bearings.  It stays like that for 20-30 minutes at least.  And that is after just a few seconds of light.

I also checked it using the red LEDs on the headlamp.  They will not make the compass light up like a Christmas tree the way a strong white light will, but you can even charge the glowing bits with a red LED to avoid ruining your dark adaption.

I can understand why the military would need a tritium one - it means you can use the compass without showing any light at all.  But I am struggling to imagine any realistic civilian situation where this one wouldn't work at least as well.  So I think you can get this safely and save the extra cost of the tritium one.",05-01-2015

Either it's great and really expensive (Gibson guitars), terribly overrated and overpriced (Fender- AND I AM A FENDER AMERICAN TELE PLAYER, they play great if you find the one in 1000 that is manufactured well and pay through the nose for it), or it's cheap and sucky.

I went searching for a good sighting compass, and at REI the USA made Brunton 7 caught my eye. Mirror sight, declination adjustment, Global needle (as if I'll need that...), what more could you want? Well HOW ABOUT A COMPASS THAT DOESN'T SUCK? Man what a dog. Sticky needle (it's a ""global needle,"" shouldn't it be freer than most?) crappy declination sticker put on 2 degrees off, nothing lined up perfectly, an overpriced toy really. I returned it the day after I bought it. I've read reviews of similarly priced suunto compasses, they seem to be about the same, so maybe the factory workers in Finland are miserable minimum wage employees too, who knows. No pride in their work is all you can say, it's not THAT hard to carefully put on a sticker, and quality control is obviously not important to those companies for the lower priced tools.

So I dug around Amazon a little more, and stumbled upon this lensatic army lookin' compass. I thought I was going to have to spring at least $60 for a high-end Suunto compass to meet my ""unreasonable"" requirement of a compass that will give you the same reading twice from the same spot. When I saw this Cammenga compass for $45, with great reviews, I figured I had to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did. For the kind of ""not super deep woods"" hiking and fishing I do, I don't really need a map compass (because I don't often use a map), I need a sighting compass, so that's what was attractive to me about the mirror compasses. I had never used a lensatic before, they always seemed too complicated, but I was dead wrong. A couple YouTube videos later and now I'm an expert with a lensatic. Joking of course, but really, for general direction finding and occasional map use, how can you beat this? Would I have died in the woods on one of my wimpy trips less than 2 miles from my campsite it car with the crappy Brunton? No. But I LIKE precision tools. I like that I can take crazy accurate readings if I need to, and I like that the sighting wire, lens sight, and index line actually line up. And you know what? Mils are pretty awesome.  As you might have noticed from earlier in this review I'm a musician, so I think in 4s quite naturally, degrees are all 3s and 9s, baby. I also did quite a bit of math so degrees weren't exactly a nightmare (radian compass anyone? I'll buy it... Or maybe not), but I like Mils and this compass is designed for that if you want precision.

So let me wrap up this very silly review by saying, this is a very good compass. While it's not the easiest tool to use for map work, it will certainly do the job perfectly if needed. But for the ""bearing from a landmark"" or general direction type of orienteering I do, there's really nothing better. And everything lines up, and it's under $50, and its American made. Heck yeah.",02-26-2015

1) The bezel is really hard to click in some ranges of its rotation and then becomes too loose and hardly clicks at around 20-120 degrees and can be wobbled. I am returning it for this reason.

2) The hinge on the lid is also way too stiff though I imagine that would ease up over time.

3) The phosphorescence doesn't work very well despite holding under a bright lamp and then going into a dark room - the phosphorous on my watch works a bit better.

4) Sometimes the locking mechanism doesn't work as well as others - if you snap the lens down quickly that helps, otherwise the dial still moves a bit.

5) The bezel is just notched plastic and even if mine weren't defective I can see the cut notches that make it click easily wearing down over time.",12-12-2014

Instead, the face is phosphorescent - hold a flashlight over it for five seconds or so, and it will glow in the dark for about ten minutes.  Even older folks with bad night vision will be able to read it just as well at night as during the day.  The anodized aluminum finish looks very military, and the pouch is olive drab with a big ""US"" in military block letters - very, very cool.

This is NOT a map compass.  It's a lensatic compass, which makes it easier to navigate by dead reckoning.  Line up the sighting wire with the U-shaped notch over the lens, hold it as close to your dominant eye as possible (level with the ground, of course), and read your azimuth off the dial.  Find a landmark on that azimuth and walk towards it.  This is a precision instrument you're buying - if your pace count is accurate, you can find an ammo can, on the ground, in the woods, at night, hundreds of meters away, just like they do at OCS!  You can also set your bearing like on a map compass, but there is an extra step involved because the dial moves with the needle.  You must instead turn the bezel ring, in the OPPOSITE direction (clockwise to go west, counter-clockwise to go east).  So that you can use it in the dark, the bezel ring is very tactile and clicks as you turn it.  One click equals three degrees.  The lens is on an adjustable arm in case you wear glasses and need more eye relief - just be sure that your glasses don't affect the magnet.  The compass comes with a handy instruction manual that tells you how to navigate with it, and it's super fun to use.

The map ruler on one side is meant for NATO maps, which are 1:50,000 scale.  Most USGS contour maps are 1:24,000 scale, but it varies by state.  I know that Colorado maps tend to be 1:50,000 scale, and you can always bring a protractor with multiple rulers.

My one gripe with this compass is that it is quite heavy - about eight ounces.  Since I use it while backpacking, that's kind of a big deal for me - your mileage may very.  It's a military compass, though, so it's going to be built to last - pretty much any piece of gear you bring will break before this thing does.  Even the pouch and belt clip are indestructible.  I'm sorry to say that I've dropped mine twice, but you would never know it, because even being in the sand left no nicks or scratches whatsoever - the glass, the finish, the metal are still good as new.  There's no liquid inside the housing, so it's not affected by temperature or altitude.  When you're ready to ditch your Walmart compass and get something fit for a professional, this is the instrument you want.  I would buy it even if it was $100.",10-15-2014

The unit is very sturdy and solid feeling.  When opened the ruler is straight and rigid and will not twist unlike plastic mirror compasses.  The sights are aligned, the parts are heavy duty and will not bend.  Except for the bezel and glass cover [ which are plastic] everything is metal [ stamped aluminum.]  If you've used compasses before, you'll appreciate how well built the Cammenga 27 is.  The compass card rotates more freely and accurately than a comparative fluid filled one.

Pro
high quality construction and machining
easy to sight compared to a mirror compass even with older eyes
strong magnet
very free rotation
the phosphorescent marks are ergonomically placed
weatherproof: water, cold & heat
easy to self service

Cons
The gluing of the needle to the card can sometimes be sloppy, an esthetic more than functional thing
mils scale is its principle scale
non-baseplate design

A question in my mind was rather or not I would purchase the 27CS model with phosphorescent illuminated dial or the 3H model with radio active Tritium illumination, which costs about $27 more. The two models are identical otherwise. I finally purchased both models, so I speak from a position of experience. Though the model 3H constantly glows it is somewhat dim while the C27CS when excited by a light source remains more brightly illuminated for a short time. I found that a Ultra Violet flash light works well  in exciting the phosphorous. So, essentially I found the phosphorescent model 27CS is more easily viewed in the dark and costs significantly less. As to the quality of the two; they are excellently built and I very much recommend it to everyone. I hope that my experience will assist those who find themselves in a like decision making event. As an aside I think it would be a good  idea for Cammenga to offer a model that has both Tritium and phosphorous delineated information on the dial and a battery operated LED assisted lighted dial perhaps with a solar rechargeablility.",02-02-2014

I lost it along with a hat and a few other items.  Needless to say, the compass was the greatest loss.  I suppose it was just Karma that it was stolen from me but, thats another story.

Anyway, while this compass does not have the tritium the other did, it does light up well in the dark with the help of a few seconds of flashlight exposure - obviously something you would not want to do in combat!!!  You can just feel how solid this compass is compared to the lightweight ones that call themselves military and it finds magnetic north instantly unlike the one I have that seems to be thinking about which way north is.

With todays GPS systems and the fact that most of us don't really spend much time deep in the woods where a compass might come in handy (if you didn't know that the sun rises in the east) this is more of a toy for me than a useful commodity.  Like a good flashlight, a good knife a bow, handgun, binocular, fire starter and perhaps a rifle, this compass will probably be much like that piece of rock candy Chief Dan George had in The Outlaw Josey Wales  its not for eatin, its just for lookin through.

It just looks/feels like a high quality product... The same feeling I have when I hold a brand new Snap-on ratchet or a Zippo - - Made in USA for sure... It has a quick dampening time, so pointer levels out in a couple seconds, and doesn't act erratic while holding it. I don't have steady hands, and my hands shake more than most people... So it's been useful to use Brunton style compasses with a level... And while trying to maintain level, even decent compasses will oscillate more than a I'd like... This one doesn't need a lvel,and will stay steady when rotating bezel as well.
The instructions that come with it are good... When I taught myself to use a compass years ago, I did so with a pdf of this exact guide.
It doesn't seem as distracted by electronics as much as other compasses... it's induction dampening is crucial... Liquid dampening compasses are for busters.

I had land navigation training 35 years ago while in the infantry, and when I opened up this compass, it immediately felt like an old friend.  Solid stable feel, with all of the features (other than declination adjustment) that anybody could need in a compass.  And, since I won't be guiding artillery fire or air attacks, nor coordinating efforts with other units speed isn't an issue.  I will take my time and do the declination adjustment in my head, and adjust accordingly.

I will feel comfortable on the trail with this compass, and some laser printed topographic maps with me.

Absolutely. Is it easy to read? Definitely. Is it accurate? 100%. Is it a bit over-kill if you're not using it to measure the distance and trajectory for firing mortars, shells, and other ammunition into an enemy base at night? Of course. Do I love it? Damn right I do.

Ok, I realize that this is way over-kill for the average outdoorsman and camper, and unless you're in active-duty military and currently serving in a war-zone or hostile territory, you're not going to be able to fully utilize everything this compass is capable of helping you to accomplish. Silva compasses are fantastic tools and work just fine, those are the kinds I've had and used for most of my life and I do endorse them. I still have my first one from over 20 years ago and it works without any problems. However, I just couldn't help myself with this one, they're just so...cool. These are the perfect tool for when you're hiking. Now, since I am not active military, I do not have any night-time engagements planned (It can be incredibly dangerous to hike through the woods at night, so I avoid it where possible), so this is why I went for the phosphorescent as opposed to the H3 luminescence. H3 has a half-life of about 12.3 years, so it's brightness will fade in about 10 years or so (same as this one). Since I don't need it to always be glowing (and you can't have the H3 replaced or anything), I decided to go for the cheaper option. If you're looking at buying one of these for a loved one currently serving in the military, go for the H3, I'm sure they will get more use out of it than a weekend warrior, such as myself. Oh, and as of writing this, these compasses are made in Dearborn, MI. Cheers.",01-21-2016

I couldn't bring myself to buy one of the many very cheap compasses I found while searching for the right compass. I settled on this one because it has everything I learned on in the military, without making me grit my teeth as I click purchase.

First of all, yes this is made of plastic, but not the plastic you are going to first think of. The plastic is a very dense and durable material. It just feels sturdy and well made. It can take a beating, but a compass should never be subjected to a beating. You pull it out, gear your bearing, and tuck it away until you need it again. Don't go trying to pound your tent stakes in with this, or any compass you decide on. If you use common sense, this will last you as long as you need it to, unless you lose it.

I can't comment on how bright this will stay or how easy it will be to read at night in pitch black... But if you can't see anything at all, it would be unsafe to travel in such lighting anyway, and if you have a flashlight then it doesn't matter how bright this gets.

The carrying case it comes in is basically exactly like what you would find at an Army Surplus outlet. It is that thin green water proof material. Not my favorite material, but makes this compass remind me even more of the one I had in the military.

For the price point of this item you can't go wrong. It isn't so cheap that it makes you question it's quality, but it isn't so expensive that you have to skimp on your other survival gear to get it. This will be all the compass you will need for whatever it is you are doing. I would recommend this to anyone in the market for a quality compass.",11-12-2015
https://www.amazon.com/Cammenga-27CS-Lensatic-Compass-Phosphorescent/dp/B0016SRA4Y,21,Sports and Outdoor,"Cammenga 27CS Lensatic Compass, Phosphorescent, Clam Pack",4.6,4,one can easily resolve angles as small as 10 milliradians,"Very rugged compass.  I believe Cammenga's quality control may be slipping.  The compass is capable of resolving in between the lines.  With careful use of the lens avoiding parallax errors, one can easily resolve angles as small as 10 milliradians.  However, using surveyor bench mark I have had only one out of three read correctly.  The worst was off by 40mils (returned it and they replaced it with a capsule that was off by 20mils). And now I finally have one that is dead naught on.  So I would say your accuracy is the luck of the draw.  It is possible to compensate for these errors if you require this kind of precision from your unit.  However, it annoys me to have a fudge factor.  That being said, error in magnetic declination can easily swallow that small compass manufacturing error.  Even taking a bearing 10 feet away from an automobile can cause a deflection as much as 40mils.  That out of the way, there is no other compass that is as rugged and nearly indestructible as the Cammenga.  If your depend on your compass in life/death situations this would be the best back up compass.  However, in hypothermic conditions your brain becomes more prone to mistakes when doing math, so the first compass I would recommend is a high quality base plate (protractor) compass that allows you to set and forget magnetic declination.  They are not as precise, but much easier to use under extreme cold and mental fog.

It's metal just about everywhere, it has bright phosphorescence, an easy to read dial, and a clear sight.  I love it.

That said, this is my second compass.  The one that I initially received had a shorter lens bracket for some reason, which meant that it couldn't fold over on top of the bezel; it could only lean against it at about a 45 angle.  Of course, this meant that the clamshell couldn't be closed fully.  So I sent it back to Cammenga (a simple process after an email with a description of the problem, and they paid the shipping costs) and I got a replacement a few weeks later.

The new one still seems to be off, but only by a millimeter or two.  The lens bracket doesn't lie completely flat because it hits the edge of the bezel, and this means that the compass can't quite close 100% (see photos).  It's close enough though (and way better than the one I returned), and doesn't interfere with the operation of the compass.  I am curious as to whether the rubbing against the bezel will mean that I'll be seeing wear spots on it at some point.

You should spend more.

This thing is very cool.  It is very accurate, dampens quickly and lets you shoot accurate bearings very quickly once you get the hang of how to use it.  Yes, it isn't the lightest compass out there, but that is because it is built like a tank.  The whole thing is just extremely high quality.  Given that I am just a hiker and backpacker - I expect it will last me the rest of my life, easily.  Given what a vital piece of kit a compass is - I am perfectly ok with the weight/size/quality trade-off.

I agree with the other reviewers that there is really no need to spend more for tritium.  If you are thinking this will work like the luminescent hands of your wristwatch - glow very dimly for a few minutes and then go out, you are in for a nice surprise.

I hit it with nothing more powerful than a hiking headlamp at close range for a few seconds.  It glowed so brightly you could read the entire dial.  It stayed that way for several minutes.  Eventually the glow lowered down so you can only see the glowing bits - but that includes everything you need to use the compass, including being able to read bearing numbers off the dial and even shoot new bearings.  It stays like that for 20-30 minutes at least.  And that is after just a few seconds of light.

I also checked it using the red LEDs on the headlamp.  They will not make the compass light up like a Christmas tree the way a strong white light will, but you can even charge the glowing bits with a red LED to avoid ruining your dark adaption.

I can understand why the military would need a tritium one - it means you can use the compass without showing any light at all.  But I am struggling to imagine any realistic civilian situation where this one wouldn't work at least as well.  So I think you can get this safely and save the extra cost of the tritium one.",05-01-2015

Either it's great and really expensive (Gibson guitars), terribly overrated and overpriced (Fender- AND I AM A FENDER AMERICAN TELE PLAYER, they play great if you find the one in 1000 that is manufactured well and pay through the nose for it), or it's cheap and sucky.

I went searching for a good sighting compass, and at REI the USA made Brunton 7 caught my eye. Mirror sight, declination adjustment, Global needle (as if I'll need that...), what more could you want? Well HOW ABOUT A COMPASS THAT DOESN'T SUCK? Man what a dog. Sticky needle (it's a ""global needle,"" shouldn't it be freer than most?) crappy declination sticker put on 2 degrees off, nothing lined up perfectly, an overpriced toy really. I returned it the day after I bought it. I've read reviews of similarly priced suunto compasses, they seem to be about the same, so maybe the factory workers in Finland are miserable minimum wage employees too, who knows. No pride in their work is all you can say, it's not THAT hard to carefully put on a sticker, and quality control is obviously not important to those companies for the lower priced tools.

So I dug around Amazon a little more, and stumbled upon this lensatic army lookin' compass. I thought I was going to have to spring at least $60 for a high-end Suunto compass to meet my ""unreasonable"" requirement of a compass that will give you the same reading twice from the same spot. When I saw this Cammenga compass for $45, with great reviews, I figured I had to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did. For the kind of ""not super deep woods"" hiking and fishing I do, I don't really need a map compass (because I don't often use a map), I need a sighting compass, so that's what was attractive to me about the mirror compasses. I had never used a lensatic before, they always seemed too complicated, but I was dead wrong. A couple YouTube videos later and now I'm an expert with a lensatic. Joking of course, but really, for general direction finding and occasional map use, how can you beat this? Would I have died in the woods on one of my wimpy trips less than 2 miles from my campsite it car with the crappy Brunton? No. But I LIKE precision tools. I like that I can take crazy accurate readings if I need to, and I like that the sighting wire, lens sight, and index line actually line up. And you know what? Mils are pretty awesome.  As you might have noticed from earlier in this review I'm a musician, so I think in 4s quite naturally, degrees are all 3s and 9s, baby. I also did quite a bit of math so degrees weren't exactly a nightmare (radian compass anyone? I'll buy it... Or maybe not), but I like Mils and this compass is designed for that if you want precision.

So let me wrap up this very silly review by saying, this is a very good compass. While it's not the easiest tool to use for map work, it will certainly do the job perfectly if needed. But for the ""bearing from a landmark"" or general direction type of orienteering I do, there's really nothing better. And everything lines up, and it's under $50, and its American made. Heck yeah.",02-26-2015

1) The bezel is really hard to click in some ranges of its rotation and then becomes too loose and hardly clicks at around 20-120 degrees and can be wobbled. I am returning it for this reason.

2) The hinge on the lid is also way too stiff though I imagine that would ease up over time.

3) The phosphorescence doesn't work very well despite holding under a bright lamp and then going into a dark room - the phosphorous on my watch works a bit better.

4) Sometimes the locking mechanism doesn't work as well as others - if you snap the lens down quickly that helps, otherwise the dial still moves a bit.

5) The bezel is just notched plastic and even if mine weren't defective I can see the cut notches that make it click easily wearing down over time.",12-12-2014

Instead, the face is phosphorescent - hold a flashlight over it for five seconds or so, and it will glow in the dark for about ten minutes.  Even older folks with bad night vision will be able to read it just as well at night as during the day.  The anodized aluminum finish looks very military, and the pouch is olive drab with a big ""US"" in military block letters - very, very cool.

This is NOT a map compass.  It's a lensatic compass, which makes it easier to navigate by dead reckoning.  Line up the sighting wire with the U-shaped notch over the lens, hold it as close to your dominant eye as possible (level with the ground, of course), and read your azimuth off the dial.  Find a landmark on that azimuth and walk towards it.  This is a precision instrument you're buying - if your pace count is accurate, you can find an ammo can, on the ground, in the woods, at night, hundreds of meters away, just like they do at OCS!  You can also set your bearing like on a map compass, but there is an extra step involved because the dial moves with the needle.  You must instead turn the bezel ring, in the OPPOSITE direction (clockwise to go west, counter-clockwise to go east).  So that you can use it in the dark, the bezel ring is very tactile and clicks as you turn it.  One click equals three degrees.  The lens is on an adjustable arm in case you wear glasses and need more eye relief - just be sure that your glasses don't affect the magnet.  The compass comes with a handy instruction manual that tells you how to navigate with it, and it's super fun to use.

The map ruler on one side is meant for NATO maps, which are 1:50,000 scale.  Most USGS contour maps are 1:24,000 scale, but it varies by state.  I know that Colorado maps tend to be 1:50,000 scale, and you can always bring a protractor with multiple rulers.

My one gripe with this compass is that it is quite heavy - about eight ounces.  Since I use it while backpacking, that's kind of a big deal for me - your mileage may very.  It's a military compass, though, so it's going to be built to last - pretty much any piece of gear you bring will break before this thing does.  Even the pouch and belt clip are indestructible.  I'm sorry to say that I've dropped mine twice, but you would never know it, because even being in the sand left no nicks or scratches whatsoever - the glass, the finish, the metal are still good as new.  There's no liquid inside the housing, so it's not affected by temperature or altitude.  When you're ready to ditch your Walmart compass and get something fit for a professional, this is the instrument you want.  I would buy it even if it was $100.",10-15-2014

Cons
The gluing of the needle to the card can sometimes be sloppy, an esthetic more than functional thing
mils scale is its principle scale
non-baseplate design

A question in my mind was rather or not I would purchase the 27CS model with phosphorescent illuminated dial or the 3H model with radio active Tritium illumination, which costs about $27 more. The two models are identical otherwise. I finally purchased both models, so I speak from a position of experience. Though the model 3H constantly glows it is somewhat dim while the C27CS when excited by a light source remains more brightly illuminated for a short time. I found that a Ultra Violet flash light works well  in exciting the phosphorous. So, essentially I found the phosphorescent model 27CS is more easily viewed in the dark and costs significantly less. As to the quality of the two; they are excellently built and I very much recommend it to everyone. I hope that my experience will assist those who find themselves in a like decision making event. As an aside I think it would be a good  idea for Cammenga to offer a model that has both Tritium and phosphorous delineated information on the dial and a battery operated LED assisted lighted dial perhaps with a solar rechargeablility.",02-02-2014

I lost it along with a hat and a few other items.  Needless to say, the compass was the greatest loss.  I suppose it was just Karma that it was stolen from me but, thats another story.

Anyway, while this compass does not have the tritium the other did, it does light up well in the dark with the help of a few seconds of flashlight exposure - obviously something you would not want to do in combat!!!  You can just feel how solid this compass is compared to the lightweight ones that call themselves military and it finds magnetic north instantly unlike the one I have that seems to be thinking about which way north is.

With todays GPS systems and the fact that most of us don't really spend much time deep in the woods where a compass might come in handy (if you didn't know that the sun rises in the east) this is more of a toy for me than a useful commodity.  Like a good flashlight, a good knife a bow, handgun, binocular, fire starter and perhaps a rifle, this compass will probably be much like that piece of rock candy Chief Dan George had in The Outlaw Josey Wales  its not for eatin, its just for lookin through.  I have to admit that at over 60 Im still just a little boy in a mans body and while I don't really need it, I just had to have it so I can hold it and play with it at my leisure.

I prefer to use cheaper pairs since I tend to damage or lose sunglasses on a regular basis, and these are the first pair I've ordered online that even come close to fitting my requirements - especially fitting close to my face on the bottom edge. They're not perfect - there's a small gap on the left/right edges that isn't covered by the lens, but in practice it's hardly noticeable.

I have wrap around suglasses that don't let any unfiltered sunlight in. Almost like goggles. But they are bulky. These do pretty much the same job with a fraction of the weight and size.

This is my second pair of Duduma brand sunglasses. The first was a frame that completely surrounded the lens. However, like the first pair, the quality of plastic and manufacturing is poor at best. Additionally, these sunglasses are dangerous because there is an extremely sharp edge on the open lens. The edge of the lens is so sharp it could cut a face. For example, if your playing a sport and these get knocked on your face, you could end up with a really nice cut of your cheek under your eye or worse; no thank you.

Although, the lenses are polarized, they are not the quality of the lens I expected. I did not expect Oakley level quality, but this is not even flea market quality. In fact, Ive seen childrens sunglasses that were better manufactured with a better grade of plastic and lenses.

CONCLUSION
I realize I am the minority in my negative review, but I guess I just have higher standards than most. I really thought form all the good reviews these were going to be better than what I received.

As a result of the cheaply manufactured product where there is potential of cutting my face because the lens is sharp, I do not recommend this product and I do not recommend Duduma as a brand because this is my second pair I received that is poorly manufactured with extremely cheap materials.",01-04-2018

They fit his head perfectly.  He wears a medium hat so these glasses might be tight on a man with a large head, but for my husband they are perfect.  He likes the way the lenses tilt every so slightly because they don't get fogged up like other pairs he has had, and they wrap all the way around for really good eye protection from the sides.  A lot of wrap around sunglasses have wide solid side pieces, obscuring peripheral vision.  These do not do that.

The price was excellent for this quality.  They came with a hard case and also a soft bag for storage.  If the person actually uses those it should prevent the lenses from being scratched from being tossed around in the car or truck and from being damaged when ""sat upon"".  :)",11-30-2017

The nose piece does mold to the near well, the frame is not molded straight (that's means it's crooked) and the arms don't plot in between between my ears and my head very well. They push my ears out and don't hold glasses firmly against the side of the temple.

You get what you pay for.,"I've worn Oakleys for 10 years, but my pair weren't polarized and I wanted to upgrade at a cheaper price!  So I tried Duduma, based on the reviews and affordable price.  At first I was really impressed, nice looking sunglasses with a hard case, scratch-free carrying bag, all included for free.  The sunglasses were a little uncomfortable after wearing for a long time, but not too bad.  Worse than my Oakleys, but OK for the price.

On a hot and sunny day, I sprayed my neck and face down with sunscreen.  Apparently, these sunglasses cannot be touched by sunscreen!  Within days, the plastic started to bubble (see photos).  Worse yet, a few days later the sunglasses broke completely in half!  It's like the sunscreen completely broke-down the plastic.

I have several Maui Jim's and these are no Maui Jim quality sunglasses (of course they are in the $200 price range).  Howeve they appear to be ok for the price.  These are not top notch quality, but I've seen name brands ($40 - $70 range) which were no better in quality than these.  I got two of these during Amazon's lightning deals so I could just leave them in my vehicles and don't have to worry about forgetting to bring sunglasses during those sunny days.  The polarized lens work well (like my Maui Jim's).  They do have internal glare since they do not have the anti-reflective coatings (Maui's are standard).  The lens are also not ANSI certified, meaning they don't meet the safety glass standards (stop pellets from a shotgun), thus they are thinner.  I think these are plain plastic lenses, not the polycarbonate lenses which meet the ANSI standard for impact resistance, and probably not the best optical quality plastic lens.  I jus had them for about a few days so I don't know how they'll hold up.  I've had my Maui Jim's for years and still holding up like new (minus the very minor scratches front normal wear and tear and a few drops on pavement, that you can't see unless close up).  I guess time will tell.  But for now they are decent for the price and if I lose them or break them, I wouldn't feel as bad as compared to my Maui Jim's.  They are relatively light and looks good (I got the plain grey/black lens, I believe the reflective coatings are just sprayed on for looks and don't last long, as it is one of the major complaints).  For $15 (lightning deal price), I think these are decent, just don't expect these to perform like the high end name brands like Oakley's, Maui Jim's, or others, and these are good throw away sunglasses.  Only gripe I have with these is that I wish they had anti-reflective coatings on the inside of the lens.  Other than that, these are decent for the price (department stores have lower quality sunglasses for more price).  Just don't expect the same quality as the true high end sunglasses.",10-15-2017

Because after a while, they do pinch my nose and I have to readjust them.
The frame also kinda sticks out a bit in the middle and takes some getting used to. You can see it there, on your nose (compared to other glasses where they're flatter and smoother).

They do have good vision though. Not cheap and they do protect your eyes from the glare of the sun.
They do hold up and don't slide down your nose.
They are light and the frame is well made and sturdy.

Recommended? Yeah, with some reservations because of the need to adjust them due to the slight pinching
I got them for $13.99, so I guess for that price, I can't expect a perfect pair of sunglasses.

UPDATE: January 2018. Happy New Year, I'm buying a new pair of sunglasses. These started getting warped (for some weird reason) and now the left lense is too close to my left eyelashes. It's annoying. They were fine before, but now this.
I wouldn't recommend them anymore. Come on $20 is a low price compared to the brand names, but can I get a decent pair that doesn't warp for that price? I think I should be able to, no?",10-14-2017

My initial assessment was they seemed to be a good choice for the price. I have seem some reviews where they have been suggested as Oakley equivalents, but they are not the same quality as my Oakley's. They do come with a nice case, bag, and cleaning cloth.

Anyway, I went saltwater kayak fishing for a week and used these glasses. The optic quality is good, and I like the fit and finish. I have the Tr62 Superlight Frame (black/blue). They seemed to be a very good value. However, I had an incident where my kayak rolled over in the surf. The glasses were inside the case with the bag. Everything was wet from the saltwater. Later I rinsed the glasses, case, bag, and all in fresh water. I then dried/cleaned the lenses with a soft cotton t-shirt. I then went to wear them and noticed the optical quality was very bad. I rinsed them again and used a soft cotton towel to clean them. Still bad. Upon examination, the blue coating on the front of the lenses came off portions of both lenses. The plastic lens is not scratched at all to indicate any abrasion, but it looks like the blue coating just wiped off in certain areas. I am at a loss as to what I did to cause this damage but think it must have been from saltwater exposure, then wiping? Somehow I wiped away part of the blue coating. I'll say that my use of these glasses was a bit extreme in that they were exposed to seawater on occasion and fish slime, etc.",09-26-2017

First off, Duduma did a good job creating affordable glasses that are not only stylish, but are really good at outdoors activities. I'll admit, I was hesitant at first since I never heard of this brand, but upon reading reviews, I've decided to take a chance and buy them. It was a good choice. I've jogged, hiked, and drove (approximately 400miles with these on a road trip) with these on, which by the way, these are really good road trip sunglasses! Now the cons are that the frames are tight around the ear lopes and they are not flexible, so beware! I put these sunglasses on top of my baseball cap multiple times before entering a store or restaurant and eventually it broke. (It's sunny, hot and bright where I live, so I don't take my baseball cap off for nothing.) Well, I took off one star since I cannot wear these sunglasses with a baseball cap, but other than that these things are solid, so if you drive a lot or jog, then purchase these, you won't regret it. Just don't wear a hat with them.",08-08-2017

Well, this pair of Duduma is now at the top of my list and I can't wait to see them on sale again. I've found the style and fit to be exactly what I was after. The lenses are optically clear and easily wipe clean. I've already sat on them a few times but after the 'uh oh' moment passed they had no damage. The most interesting detail which at first i thought I wasn't going to like was the nose piece. When I opened the package the nose was wide and they sat really low on my face. After a quick groan I realized the two sides of the nose piece are not molded as I'd assumed (like many other glasses in this price range) but are instead metal covered in soft-ish rubber/plastic, and can be squeezed or widened for a perfect fit! These will be on my face for the rest of the summer including 5 or 6 more beach trips so I'll update this review again in a couple months.",07-04-2017

See Picture.,"**Update on 7/8/17**
 - After I submitted the below review, Duduma contacted me about the issue I had. They were willing to provide me with a new pair of sunglasses at no cost to me. I selected a slightly different style (hopefully to prevent the same lens crack as before) and it arrived today. In my opinion, any company willing to better their name and a customer's review by providing a replacement free, is well worth the increased review score. I cannot change the review from before (it's still true and accurate) but I have improved their scoring from 3 stars to 5 because I appreciate their willingness to stand behind their name and product(s)**

The Good:
These glasses appear to fit well(but see below), there is very good shading = these are the darkest sunglasses I've owned in years and perfect for a sunny day, and the polarizing effects are good/noticeable.
The Not So Good:
After only a few wearings, the right lens has a small crack in it - following directly the 'point' of the black frame on the front/side. The location is more than a coincidence - since it follows exactly the frame. I suppose a little bit of pressure may have been put against the lens, but I am careful with my sunglasses, so it wouldn't have been done treating the sunglasses roughly. Also, I suppose the 'flex' of the frames going on my head could place a little pressure there, but if so, it's relatively slight. There are no cracks on the left side...yet. So, I'm not sure where the blame lies, but there is a crack in the lens after only a few wearings.
I liked these so much that I bought a second pair for my son... but have not given them to him yet because I may need to use his lenses for my glasses, unfortunately.",06-30-2017

So I decided to find a less expensive option and arrived at these.  I wear sunglasses religiously when outdoors and have for years.  I ride motorcycle quite a bit and wear sunglasses with my helmet.  I wear my sunglasses up on my baseball cap when I come in from outdoors, so I need them to stick to the cap well as most lens scratches for me come from them falling off my cap and hitting the concrete or gravel.

These glasses have GREAT lenses in them.  Crystal clear with no distortion at all; very happy with the lens!  The frame fits very snug against my large, round head.  They tend to ride pretty close to my eyeballs, which I don't mind, but in doing so my eyelashes can touch the lens and be annoying at first.  The bows have a small amount of rubber on the inside, which is great for holding power on my cap.  But it's not too much rubber so that it's annoying when putting them on and taking them off with my helmet.

If you're looking for a decent Oakley replacement, look no further!  At this price, I can afford to lose and scratch them without getting too mad at myself!  Don't get me wrong, I really like Oakley's, but just got tired of the high price for as quickly as I seem to go through them.",03-02-2017

I had some problem with the shiny outer coating peeling off on my glasses, and posted the original review below. Within a few weeks, customer service apparently noticed my comments and reached out to my directly to see if they could help me. They asked for some photos, which I sent, after which they agreed that the problem was not related to misuse/abuse. To compensate, they offered to send a brand new pair, or for me to pick a new style/color with the same value. I opted to try something slightly different, and have been very pleased so far with not only the value, but also the build quality. I have unfortunately lost that new pair, but decided to order another one to replace it. Happy customer here.

Original review:
These were awesome shades for a great price, until the shiny coating on them started peeling off after only 6 months of use. I didn't abuse them, just wore them mainly for driving and cycling a couple times a week. I still use them for cycling since I don't really care what I look like when I'm on my bike, but these are no longer in any condition to be worn in public unfortunately. I will be searching for a more durable option, and perhaps spend more this time around.",12-21-2016

I want to clarify that 3 stars is the average of the ""I don't like it"" 2 star on the blues and the ""I like it"" 4 stars on the black ones. 3 isn't bad, it's just ""Okay"" which is my feeling about these sunglasses. The seller emailing me to get me to remove the review though, that I don't like at all.

I bought the White/Blue pair as well as the Black/Black pair. While they look similar, they are quite different.

White/Blue Pair:
I bought this pair because I was hoping they had a blue tint to help pick up on golf balls while out golfing. They do not. They are standard sunglasses and the blue tint can only be seen from the face of the glasses. I'm not sure what the point of it is, but it's not functional or useful. I'm not happy with this set of glasses, but for twenty bucks I'll keep them in my bag as a spare. I wouldn't buy them again, though.

Black/Black Pair:
They fit nicely even if they're a little wider than my rather large head. They're definitely more comfortable than the White/Blue Pair. I would buy these again.",09-22-2016

Comes with every accessory you could hope for with sunglasses: hard shell storage case, soft fabric pouch, and micro-fiber polishing cloth.
The accessories all present nicely, they are decent quality but not amazing.  Gets the job done.
The sunglasses themselves are a step above most generic cheapies, but they are also priced well above.  Seemingly a full plastic band, it does grip onto my head solidly but comfortably.  Appearance is sporty bland.
As for quality- hard to say as I haven't had them too long.  The lenses do worry me a bit in that when I have cleaned them they feel very loose/fragile.  While nothing has happened yet, I worry they might pop off.

Currently priced at $20, they are pricey for a no-name pair of sunglasses, but so far meet expectations and come with great storage options.
I used a publicly available coupon to purchase these getting them a bit cheaper than their normal price which probably makes me more ok with the price:product return.  I do not plan on buying additional pairs at this price point.",09-17-2016

They came in a very nice case, with a lens cleaning cloth,  that was solid and will protect the glasses if I drop it. It wasn't just some cheap pouch that you would normally receive for something this price, that basically just keeps the glasses from getting dirty. The glasses themselves fit great and properly polarized (I've purchased polarized glasses in the past that the polarizing affect was less than what I had hoped). The reason I gave it four stars out of five is that the lenses do seem to get dirty/smudged fairly easily and frequently, but I'm not sure if that is a normal thing or not for polarized glasses. I habitually lose, break or drop sunglasses overboard (I'm a big time fisherman!), so I now refuse to spend a lot of money on them (I purchased holders that go around the back of my neck for this pair because I really don't want to lose them!). I would definitely suggest this pair of glasses at their current price and I will definitely purchase them again when I lose or break this pair! LOL",09-08-2016

They were snug at first, but after a 2 hour drive in them - they either stretched or I got use to them. Frames felt cheap at first, so I will review if something ever happens. Lenses were great. They blocked out the dashboard refelection driving down the road. May be getting a set to put and leave on my boat. Would pay $12.99 again for a pair - but still not sold on these for $19.99.

Update 2/26/18:
I originally purchased these in July of 2016. I actually purchased two pair. One all black with blue lens and the pair pictured below. I have to  admit, both pair have proven to be excellent purchases.  I have a big head and these fit well and are comfortable to wear all day long. Polarized is an excellent feature that does work well especially while fishing on sunny days. Nice wrap around design blocks the sun from the sides and the nose piece is comfortable.
A comment on Duduma.....when I purchased these and saw the lifetime warranty I was skeptical especially at this price point. I wear my sunglasses constantly when outside and am also extremely hard on them. In time after countless cleanings, I had a pair develop wear marks and scratches on the lens. My fault completely as I pretty much used everything but sand paper to wipe them clean. I liked the glasses and frame so much I contacted Duduma to see if I could PURCHASE replacement lens'. I explained, and owned up to the fact, that the issue was undoubtedly due to my improper cleaning. Well, a couple emails, a couple pictures, and a couple days later Duduma informs me they will be shipping me a new pair at no cost to me. No postage, nada, and sure enough, I did receive the new pair in a couple days. Expectations exceeded and Duduma has proven to me they are a legit and honest company willing to take care of the customer after the sale. If you are as skeptical as me, no need, they will stand behind their product. I hope this helps.",08-08-2016

It's hard to find ones that fit without pinching at either my temples or ears, but these fit like a dream out of the box.  They're light, look great, feel great, and the nose piece keeps them from sliding.  Another problem I've experienced with wrap-around lenses is that airflow gets restricted, and the lenses fog up.  Not so with these.  The polarization makes seeing anything in the harsh southern California sun easy.

The only con I can think of in regards to these is the funky plastic smell when worn the first few times.  It seems to dissipate after that.

I've found that if I spend more than $50 for a pair of sunglasses, they'll either get broken, lost or stolen.  At less than $20, these are a bargain.  I'm buying another pair as a spare.",06-03-2016

To truly examine these sunglasses, one would have to determine whether their claims are true.  I bought them because they advertise excellent qualities in filtering out UVA A and B rays.

SUNGLASSES.  But my good ones got stolen and didn't see anything worth buying for $20.00.  So, I took a chance on these Duduma's.
From order to mailbox, took 4 days!

These have very nice finish to them, and look expensive.  There are 3 grey strips on top (as you can see in photo) are more pronounced than the photo.
The fit is a good balance between being snug and not coming off while running, hiking etc.,  and not loose.  They're highly polarized and you can know this by looking out windows and seeing polarized ""rainbow effect"".
They cut down glare on tremendously.  For $20.00 this is a steal, and will probably get a second pair.
And they come with a lifetime warranty.

One of the things that I really like about the Duduma sports sunglasses is that they are lightweight and flexible. They seem to fit just right, not only on me but on Hubby, who has a rather big noggin. The sunglasses that I got are silver frames with blue/green mirrored, polarized, wrap around lenses. The wrap around lenses avoid that awkward, forced head turn when you just want to glance to the side. I like polarized lenses because I do quite a bit of boating and fishing.

Obviously, she doesn't like the style. And I don't really either. The lenses are quite wide, and they are brownish and a bit see-through. I was hoping for darker, blacker, and not see-through.

As well, my head is not overly large, but I started to get pain above my ears because the arms are very tight on my head. And this was after wearing them for about 1 minute. A few minutes after taking them off, I can still feel the pulsing in my head associated with the pain/tightness.

I have borrowed the glasses while driving and oddly enough, they fit my nose perfectly. And I have a long Italian honker. Really cool that the same pair of glasses fits such differently shaped noses so well. I love that they are rimless, this leaves my field of vision open while I'm driving. They work well for my son while horseback riding, because they keep debris from getting into his eyes as well as protecting his eyes from the sun. They look fantastic. They do not look like cheap sunglasses. And I think they look just as good as the sunglasses that cost hundreds of dollars that fill all my inboxes.

I bought a second pair.  The frames might be nearly unbreakable but the lenses sure aren't.  I had the glasses hanging off of my back pocket.

I had my hands on a Spin Doctor Pro G3 workstand. Though the Pro G3 has a slimmer head and can handle a bit more weight with its full tripod stand, the Bikehand Cycle Pro stand is more compact when folded. I actually prefer the greater working room afforded by the V stand support, so that I can set this to barely support a bike off the ground and get a lot of clearance on the back side between the Cycle Pro vertical support bar and the bike when the main support is at significantly less than 90 degree angle with the base legs on the ground. (photo would be better here...)

As this is about 2/3 the sale price of the Spin Doctor Pro G3, edge goes to the Bikehand Cycle Pro stand!

My only nit (which is not worth taking away a star): the Bikehand clamp cam could open more when in the open position. I find I have to open the jaws a bit more, then tighten it down some before clamping on the seat pins I've clamped. I think the convenience and portability compensate for this one deficiency in the clamp.

Compared to cheaper competitors, the jaws on the clamp are very nicely padded and hold together very well after nearly a month of every weekend and much weekday use. Also, the 55lb limit is conservative. It holds very well on my 65lb ebike, but I only put this heavy bike on the stand with the support legs fully extended and the vertical support nearly 90 degrees with the ground.",09-25-2013

It is light and easy to move around and it folds up nicely for storage. The tool tray is handy and holds all of my t-handle tools and small parts. I have repaired my mountain bikes, my carbon road bike and my heavy touring bike on this stand. If you set the clamp tension correctly, it holds a lot of weight. (My fully racked touring bike weighs over 40 pounds and I have used this stand to work on that bike many times without any issues.) I would recommend this to anyone who is not a professional bike technician and needs a quality stand for personal use.",06-25-2018

I had been looking at a $50 bike stand and read reviews of plastic clamps breaking, or things slipping. That won't happen with this stand. The legs fold out with a collar that slides down the main tube. The clamp is a quick-release, just like axle skewers. Adjust the tightness and lock it down. The top tube extends upward and again uses a quick-release clamp. Adjustments are easy and secure. The arm at the top is a proper bike stand vise. The lever on the back engages or disengages the teeth which old the arm from rotating. The clamp is easily adjustable and also a quick-release clamp style engagement. It's a proper bike repair tool.

I put my ~30+ lbs full-suspension bike on it and it held the weight just fine. I put a lighter 26"" hardtail on it and then wrenched on the bike for some maintenance. The vise held fine when it was clamped on the top tube with the weight equally balanced front to rear. The vise held fine when it was clamped on the seat tube with more weight toward the front and torquing on the arm. The stand appears well-built and sturdy.

The slight angle of the stand helps get the bike away from the main vertical tube. There is plenty of space to spin the pedals while the bike is on the stand. Any cleaning or adjustments you need to make which requires spinning the drivetrain shouldn't be an issue.

I think the attachable tool tray may be the only ""issue"" with the product. If you attach it then you don't be able to fully collapse the lower support legs. The clamp will hit the tool tray before it gets completely ""closed"". If you remove the tool tray it does fold in half, but there is no hook or clamp or anything to keep it attached to the collapsed stand while not in use. You could buy a velcro strap for this, so it's a minor issue. Just something I could see annoying those who will not leave it permanently open and setup. They may, at some point, misplace or lose the tool tray.",06-12-2018

This stand works great and for the price is an absolute steal.  It's light weight, compacts easily and is sturdy.

I've used it with my old M5 Specialized Stumpjumper, Niner Air 9 RDO and Niner BSB 9 RDO, for various maintenance and repair work.  I've also used it for re-sealing and rebuilding my Fox forks.  The clamp is easy to operate and easy to adjust the tension.  The ability to rotate the clamp is handy and very easy.  The plastic teeth that hold the clamp are strong and work very well, just smart and don't smash them together and rotate the clamp when they are not fully disengaged and they should hold up fine.

The only issue I ran into, when I was putting some extra torque on the Air 9 the stabilization legs started to slip, a very small amount.  I fixed this VERY easily by putting a small amount of Park SAC-2 carbon and alloy compound on the aluminum tube.  Since then, zero slipping.

This appears to be the same stand that Jenson USA sells as its ""house brand"" work stand and it's usually a couple of bucks less on Amazon.

Even if I only get a year or two out of this stand, I could buy another and STILL be under the cost of a Park stand that I have not found to be any better...",02-06-2018

The Bikehand Pro stand is much more robust than it appears in the Amazon listing.  The legs are very stable and easy to articulate.  Adjusting the height is straight forward and secure.  The tool tray was easy to install, but seemed a bit loose.  Not a big deal.

The one thing that could be a bit better is the clamping head.  It's does allow for many different clamping angles, and will fit a wide range of tube diameters, but it did take some time to get it just right.  Once adjusted, it was very secure.  But, it does feel a bit cheaper than the rest of the stand construction.  Hard to complain about it given the overall quality for the price.",01-23-2018

Locking collars are plastic, not sure what the materials the expensive stands use...  with that said it does seem to be a  high quality polymer of some sort but plastic none the less.  Overall very nice quality stand & folds up easily and nice and compact. Also has a little tray to help hold some tools while you're working on your bike.  It exceeds my expectations.

This is really well designed with two exceptions (which I'll list below).  The center post which holds most of the weight is in contact with the ground.  It leans 'forward' which prevents it from falling backwards, but this lean is counteracted by the clamp arm, so the clamp itself is still vertical.  It is VERY robust (again, for home gamers) and I have no fear that it will brake.  It is super easy to set up, but a little less so to tear down (haven't found a great way to pull the legs up yet).  The height adjustment is adequate, and you can adjust it without removing the bike because the center post lean mostly prevents the bike from dropping down when you loosen the quick release.  It is SUPER simple to adjust the clamp angle and none of the levers are difficult to engage or disengage.  The clamp has generous rubber padding and the padding even has cutouts for seat clamp posts.

But it's not perfect.  The tool tray is more trouble than it's worth unless you're not at home.  It's a hassle to attach and remove, it doesn't collapse properly when the rest of the stand is folded up and it is very flimsy.

The clamp has a wide range of tubes that it will clamp on, but the difference between it's open and closed states just using the quick release (without screwing or unscrewing) is too small.  So if I can get my seat post into the clamp, it's not going to be tight enough to hold the post, and if it's tight enough to hold the post, I can't get the seat post out.

It would also be really nice if I could rotate the bike around the center post, but at this price point, that's probably an unreasonable expectation.",10-25-2017

I leave tension on the ropes to keep some weight off the stand, as I am sure my fat E bikes will exceed the rated capacity of stand.

Design: love it.  It's reasonably stable, easy to use, and all the knobs and etc are obvious in their function.  It's done exactly what I needed to do with it so far.

Durability: I'll get back to you.  All the clamps, the rotating head, etc. are plastic, of unknown durability, and my perception thus far is that (a) you need to control your inclination to overtighten them (a couple of the lever-clamps would be easy to do so) and (b) like most such plastics will probably get brittle if stored outdoors/in sunlight.  As noted, so far and with reasonable consideration of the strength of the clamps, it's worked fine.",05-15-2017

I recently converted my bike from v to disc brakes.  I did all the conversion without this stand.  I really wish I had bought the stand before the conversion.  I bought the stand for two reasons, one to save my back from having to bend over so much and work on my bike and two, I don't live close to a bike shop and really want to learn how to easily work on my bike without having to drive an hour and pay someone else to work on it.

This was not the cheapest, neither was it the most expensive stand I looked at.  I think this was the perfect stand for the price and after setting it up and working on the bike it is well worth the money.

The set up was easy.  It's very compact when folded up and can be stored out of the way in your garage if you don't have a lot of space.  The height, tilt, and angle all have quick release skewers that you see on most of your bike wheels and seat post.  So that is very helpful when wanting to get the bike in the optimal working position for you.

The only thing I would say is a small pain is where to clamp on the bike itself and once to you do that getting the right angle so the bike is up enough to work on.  The part that clamps to your bike is plastic and still has a quick release to help get it clamped.  You could clamp it on your frame which would be easier to balance but if you have shift and brake cables running under or over the top frame tube you'll have to clamp to the seat post.  Also I had to move my reflector and rear light bracket out of the way so I could clamp to the post.

The little tray is helpful too for holding your tools but if your like me and don't have a permanent place to put the stand it takes a minute to put in on and take it off.  Overall once you get the bike balanced and at the right height for you to work it seems very solid and safe.",05-01-2017

How it has any positive reviews is beyond me. Either the reviews are scams or people have extremely low expectations. Might as well light your money on fire you'd be better off in the end.

Where do I begin, the stand is very wobbly and poorly designed. Forgot doing any actual work on your bike other than maybe lubing your chain. Once you attempt to actually work on your bike the stand will twist and collapse. It happened to me while working on my bike and it came crashing down scratching up my bike frame.

Cranking the bike while shifting gears and this stand was stable and didn't show signs of breaking. My only complaint is minor: the seat post clamp takes a bit of effort in comparison to the park stand clamps. Regardless, the money saved will be better spent for tools. The stand packs small, but at full size is comfortable to use (I'm 6').  This is a definite buy.",02-22-2017

The 2-legged design works so much better than the 3- or 4-legged ones, as it puts support where it's needed but doesn't have back legs to get in the way.  Maybe the plastic teeth in the head unit could get damaged if you abuse it, but with reasonable care it seems plenty strong enough.  The fold-up feature takes only seconds and makes it easy to store.

Full disclosure:  I've used it for only a couple of hours so far, on a 36-pound full-suspension fat bike that has fat, odd-shaped frame members.  The clamp is big enough to hold it, grips it well, angles the bike right (w/360 degree variability), and it was nice to change its height for work on different components.  Since it works well on that beast, it should work well on all the bikes in the family.",02-22-2017

Shipping / Delivery
I received the bike stand on time as ordered - two days.

Product Packaging
The bike stand comes completely assembled in an elongated box. Basically, all you have to do is open the box and unfold the bike stand to use, and then fold it up when you are done. The only assembly required is the additional tool tray.

I did have one small issue with the tool tray, and its really a minute non-issue. The tool tray folds so you can easily pack it for transportation or storage in a drawer. The issue I have is that one of the snap connection points when the tray unfolds to the flat (in use) position was broke. However, this is really not a major issue because the tray only folds closed and unfolds to a flat position to use. It does not overextend in the unfolded flat (in use) position. I am simply noting this just for the sake of providing my complete experience. Once the tool tray is attached to the bike stand, this is not an issue because it is securely held in place. In fact, I am not even sure why the tool tray snaps in the open (in use) position. Anyway.. it works either way

Quality / Durability
Like, I said this is well worth the $90 I spent on it. Its great for personal use like after your daily ride, or taking along to triathlons or MTB races. However, I would not recommend using this bike stand in a commercial environment. In my opinion, it would not stand up to the constant use a commercial stand goes through.

I used this on my first MTB, a Specialized Pitch that weighs about 30 lbs., which is massively heavier than my Felt IA triathlon, which weights just about 20 lbs. I know for certain if this stand can securely hold my Pitch, it can with no doubt  hold my Felt IA...

I reviewed about a dozen bike stands and none of them seemed to be as good quality for the price. In fact, the next best stands are Park stands that start at $140 and go up from there

Conclusion
If you're looking for a quality bike stand for personal use that is easily transportable this is the bike stand you want. If you're looking for a quality bike stand on a budget that will compete with commercial bike stands like Park, but for personal use, this is the bike stand you want. I definitely recommend this product for personal use.",11-24-2016

The stand comes packaged in a massive cardboard box and is easy to take out.  Assembly is minimal and it basically comes ready.  I tested it with a bike and didn't have too much wobble so it was good as a home shop stand.  If you're a pro, I'd recommend spending more.

Even though it is made of aluminum, it has a solid and sturdy feel to it - it's clearly a heavy gauge aluminum but its got a very nice finish on it..  It took all of about 20 seconds to unfold the legs and have it ready for its first use and that's exactly what i did.  I've got a quite expensive all carbon road bike so I cant afford any kind of unstable work stand and I can tell you, this thing is very solid and very stable with the bike in it.  The clamps operate precisely and the frame / seatpost clamp is very well padded so as not to cause any damage.  I was looking at a $300 Park Tool stand and I am very glad that I chose this unit.

I've taken it down and put it back up probably fifty times for use with twenty and twenty-five pound bikes. It's convenient, durable, and mostly well-designed. You can spend twice as much for little advantage; even Park's mid-range stands have plastic parts. I've seen Shimano use a branded version of this one at various cycling events to demonstrate components.

A few notes to address issues people have mentioned:

* All clamps with bolts have quick-release handles. You can tighten the bolt on the opposing side to make each connection as firm as you want. Unless a plastic collar is physically broken, the stand will never change position or slide. The plastic appears to be a nylon composite. It's as sturdy as any I've seen, though does flex and creak a bit more than steel.

* The rotation mechanism of the main clamp has very tight tolerances, but doesn't always arrive perfectly configured. If there's a gap between the teeth when tightened, remove the hex screw holding the flip handle, slide the handle off, and then tighten the hex screw beneath it until the teeth mesh firmly. Don't overshoot or you'll prevent rotation when the handle is loose.

* The main clamp doesn't have quite enough cam travel. You have to loosen the cam lever, hold the bike in place, engage the cam, and then spin the lever to the tighten the clamp. This is why I've docked a star. Mounting heavier bikes can be awkward. Better to attach the clamp when the bike is on the ground, then lift and rotate it into its final position.

* The two-leg design is space-efficient. It's also stable if you don't try to defeat physics. Mounting a heavy rig offset is a strain for any portable stand. You can mount by the seatpost, seat tube, top tube, or bottom tube. Pick whichever fits your bike and the adjustments you're trying to do. I do drivetrain maintenance with the stand clamped to my bike's seatpost; I just rotate the front end down so the weight is vertically centered. Shake is minimal and it puts less strain on the bike.

If I were using the stand constantly and didn't need portability, I'd spring for a Park bench-mounted arm. Otherwise, I'm not convinced the other portable stands have much more to offer than this one.",07-21-2016

I read the reviews and decided to give it a try and see if it works.  Let's just say that my skepticism is completely gone.

I love mostly everything about this stand.  Here's a list of my favorite things:

- It's study and just feels well-made.  I never felt like the bike was going anywhere while it was mounted.
- It's pretty darn adjustable with regard to height and bike angle.  While I was working on my bike, I could quickly set everything up so that I could work comfortably.
- It folds up for storage in a closet.  It could be smaller, but I'm pretty happy with the footprint.
- The little tool stand is a cheap, but very nice addition.  No more losing screws and misplacing hex bits.

There were a couple of things that I think could be improved upon, but for the price, I can't really knock it.  If I paid two or three times as much, it would be a dealbreaker.

- The clamping surface is plastic - or some kind of rubbery plastic type material.  It's weird, and I don't really trust it to not crush the carbon.  That said, I used a couple of dish sponges to help grip my bike's tubes.  They let me modulate the grip a little bit better to prevent damage to my frame.  I wish that they would have used a material that is less rigid, like a soft rubber, in the clamp.  Oh well.

- The tool holder does't store with the rest of the rest of the stand very well.  It folds in half, but it's just kind of awkward.",07-07-2016

The stand is folded up in the box and all you have to do is unfold it!  How happy was I to find out that there's no major assembly!?  The parts are very sturdy and it is well builty.  The clamp and adjusting elbow are made from some type of plastic polymer but it's strong.

I've been working on upgrading my bike from a Sora to 105 groupset these past few days and this stand has been indispensible.  There is a lot of length available for the height adjustment and the stand is so well built that adjusting the bike up-or-down while the bike is mounted is VERY easy.  I adjusted it up to put on the cranks, front and rear derailleurs and lowered it back down to install the STI brake levers and cables...VERY nice.  Also, the tray is small but it has cut-outs in all shapes so you can organize your tools in those holes for easy access.  And when I'm done, I'll be able to fold the stand up and store it in a corner taking up very little space.

This is a great stand for the money.  The bike won't be immovable while on the stand but it holds well and it never feels flimsy.  I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anybody on a budget who does their own maintenance/repairs at home.",06-15-2016

This is most definitely not a Park stand, it doesn't hold the bike nearly as firm as a professional stand would (a 21"" full suspension 29er, for the record, not a light bike).  I'm worried that the plasticky bits are flexing and won't hold up over time.  But it isn't priced like a professional stand either, this is a killer price and a quality product for a stand in the budget category.  I like that it's portable too, that's going to come in handy.

This is a great option for a casual use on a budget.  But for daily use, or if you have the extra budget, I'd go with a higher quality stand for sure.",04-30-2016

Don't recommend using it for heavy work like removing bottom brackets, but it's wonderful for derailleur adjustments, chain maintenance, bike cleaning,  The tool tray is a nice feature, but for me it just gets in the way, so it just sits on the shelf.  I use it weekly and have owned it for about 5 months now.  The only gripe is the clamp neck flexes a bit, at first I thought it was loose or a defect, but it's just the way it is, hasn't really been an issue.  It's definitely worth the price.",04-28-2016

Im 6' and i have the stand fully extended. Its clamped at either the seat post or the seat tube on the frame. This puts the tray so low and on the other side of the stand. I have to bend over and reach through the frame to get at the tools. What's worse is the bolt design for keeping the tray in place. It will not hold the tray tight. There is a ton of play.  Accidentally hit the tray from underneath and watch your nuts go flying across the garage.

The rest of the stand is great though. Its light and mobile. It should be marketed as a ""travel"" stand though. Its got that weak point that everyone talks about on here.  You are not going to be gorilla tightening cranks or wheels on this thing. I was expecting something more permanent and less ""travel, quick release, pack it up and take with you, etc"".  Im left wondering if keeping it was a good idea.

UPDATE 2/8/17
The stand has been great so far. The lightness of the stand allows to easily be moved around my garage. No slippage issues. I mounted the tool tray at the top and duct taped it. Much better.",04-27-2016

This is a great bike stand.  It's light, folds up easily, has convenient trays with slots and holes in them to place tools as your using it.  Clamping to the frame or post is super easy, but it could be more intuitive.  Right now, finding the right width to clamp at requires more work than my brothers high-dollar stand.  I also wish that there were more legs involved for stability.  You can tip your bike on this if you're not careful.  Four-legged stands, or better yet, one's anchored to the floor, will always be better.  However, you can't beat the portability of this thing!  It collapses into a light weight, easy to move unit.  This will definitely be taken to the trails with me... I won't ride with it, but it'll be in the truck... just in-case.

The video review on here is well done and tells much more.  I'd recommend looking at that before buying so you know what you're getting.  If you're not an avid cyclist, this will be great for you.  If you wrench on your junk a lot, you may want something with a bit more stability.",04-20-2016

I've used to to build a MTB from scratch as well as performed routine service both indoors and out.  I've purchased this based on the reviews and price.  In hind sight, I should've spent more and get something that's more sturdy and has a better clamp mechanism.  Being on two legs this does tip towards the back and I find myself having to hold one of the legs with my foot.  This wouldn't happen if the clamp mechanism extended further out to provide additional leverage.  The clamp mechanism doesn't do a good job holding the seatpost with enough grip so it doesn't spin or slide. The clamp isn't that easy to use, it requires some adjusting to get a decent clamp. Everything seems to be well made and sturdy for the price you are paying.  The tool tray is nice and I use it a lot.  It folds up compact.  All in all it's a decent stand for the price.  If you just want something to hold your bike, don't plan on using it that much, and don't want to spend a lot, this would work.  Personally, I'd rather spend 2x to get something that is better built and more stable.  This is the case of you get a little more than what you pay for and is a decent bang for the buck.  I think this product can be improved with a 3rd leg and better quick clamp with gripper claws.",03-01-2016

I clamped on both the seat posts and frames without issue and left the bikes overnight to see if any slippage occurred, but none did.  This bike is a great value and would be 5 stars but for the adjustment on the back of the clamp that is used for changing the angle of the clamp.

Many of the reviews comments that the main clamp did not work and they fixed with a hose clamp.  I found this same issue.  But when I looked closer at the clamp - I saw the issue was not with the ability to lock in place.  Instead when you twist the tightening screw, the nut on the other end rotated as well - therefore you could not get it tight.  I held one end with a wrench and tightened the other end.

The optional tool tray is a little weird to attach and could be a bit better designed, but honestly...who cares?

It was more to self service my bike as well as a good stand to hold my bike while i washed it.
Overall, this stand is ok and works for the most part, however one thing i was not so happy with was the weak telescopic neck lock.

You can expand this stand to a certain height according to your bike size.  I tried to attach my 29'er bike and expanded the neck height on the high side to work on the chain/gears, however the locks don't stay in place so well.  The telescoping neck to increase the height of the stand started to sag and collapse back into the main tube.  This caused me to try to readjust and pull the telescopic arm back up to the height where i started.  Not sure if my unit is defective or a normal pattern on all these items.

If I had the sq ft space to spare, I would definitely go with a basic non-collapsible heavy bike stand...but since i don't, this unit works for me.  I can collapse it and store it away in a corner with minimal to no intrusion of space which is a plus for me.

Overall, It does help me do what i need to do to work on my bike.  Just a little bit of headache due to the weak telescopic neck on the stand.",12-29-2015

I use it on bikes ranging from 17 pound carbon road bikes to 30lbs full suspension mountain bikes. It does get a little shaky if I have it fully extended, twisted to hold my MTB perfectly horizontal (since a MTB seatpost is generally angled backwards), and I am torquing on it. Granted under those conditions, unless the structure is solid steel, you will always get some bend/shaking. Doesn't shake at all with my road bikes. Only wish I bought a little rolling stool to go with it so I don't have to have it at full extension all the time.",12-17-2015

The clamp that holds the seat tube is hard to engage because the lever is under the nose of the saddle. To open the jaws wide enough to fit the post in you have to loosen it to the point that it won't fully clamp down. This requires you to twist the lever a couple of times while holding the bike up before clamping it down. The reverse is true when removing the bike. This is a royal PITA.

The other thing is stability. It's pretty lightweight and easy to knock off balance when the bike is mounted.

Considering the price I can't complain. Also, it folds up nicely and would be a great stand to bring with you to the trail or race. For my purposes, using it at home, I would rather have more stability at the expense of light weight.",12-16-2015

It comes assembled, the only thing you need to attach is the tools plate. Very easy to operate, easy to transport.
For me a dependable stand, I've working on the GF's bike by two hours; scrubbing the tires, aligning the front derailleur, cleaning and lubricating the chain with no problem.

Holding a mountain bike by the seat post would most likely have stripped the teeth over time. They need to make that locking mechanism so you can tighten it up and prevent any play.  In addition this has a top to bottom clamp.  I realized any clamp that clamps top to bottom really is useless in the top tube because is grabs the cables.  This prevents you from adjusting rear brakes and derailleurs. The Feedback stands clamp front to back allowing you to still adjust brakes and derailleurs while clamping the top tube.  I returned this stand and ordered a Feedback Pro Ultralight instead.,11-23-2015

If you're coming from using quality shop equipment, the overall 5 star amazon rating on this stand is going to be a joke. It's not extremely stable and the quality of the main clamp leaves a lot to be desired.

Positives:
Low cost for the features and quality
Relatively sturdy
Very easy to adjust, vertically as well as rotating the main clamp.
Folds up nicely.
Light (positive as far as travel goes)

Cons:
Generally unstable and much more so with large or heavier bikes or when you have to use the clamp in a manner that gives the bike a lot of torque on the stand.
I found the main clamp to be bulky and often difficult to adequately tighten. The cam on the main locking lever basically has a sweet spot, and it's either too loose or too tight to even clamp if you don't get it perfect.
No matter how it's clamped it's difficult to get the main clamp tight enough to prevent rotation.
Tool platform is fairly flimsy.

With a couple of sandbags, this stand moves way up on the stability scale, but I'm not a big fan of dealing with that in a house. I still find it unstable compared to shop stands or other stands with larger floor mounting plates or legs. Depending on how much you plan on using this, it amounts to anywhere from an annoyance to a complete deal breaker. The plastic clamp works well considering it's plastic but it's really not comparable to a good steel clamp.

Overall it's a great travel or home stand and is a huge upgrade over pretty much any other cheap stand I've ever seen. For the price, or even double, there may not be much better of a stand available. But if you are looking for shop quality equipment, this isn't going to satisfy.",11-09-2015

For starters, it's light.  That's good for portability, but bad for stability.  Torquing tough bolts or trying to clean a chain almost tips it over.  I put sand bags over the ""feet"" to help keep it upright.  Second, the entire clamping mechanism is made from what looks to be injection-molded plastic.  It has worked so far, but I can easily see it just snapping apart into 5 pieces someday. The tool tray is nice, but can be collapsed too easily, sending your parts onto the floor.

Also I don't understand the little tray. The whole rack is foldable and you can collapse it very easily in few seconds, but the tray sticks out, and you need to disassemble it by unscrewing it... so what's the point of a foldable rack if the tray cannot be removed easily?

""A blessing and a curse"" as Mr. Monk would say. Easy to carry, fold up and store has to have a price.

No assembly required. It comes out of the box ready to use.
It does everything I need it to, except hold the front wheel straight. You can put the bike at any angle, but you may have to move it back and forth in clamp jaws to maintain good balance/stability.

It is very compact when folded.

The tool tray is very handy.

The controls are easy to operate and seem durable.

The clamping jaws are very nicely done. They don't pinch my brake cable, and should accommodate any shape.

It is not best for heavy bikes. Though the feet give decent stability, hitting the brakes on a spinning fat-boy would probably tip it.

You need a cross bar.  Though I can put my wife's step-through on it using the seat tube, it's pretty unwieldy.

My least favorite feature is the clamp jaw rotation lock(see photos). My misgivings are probably misplaced though. The surface area and tooth size of the interlocking gears is such that it will never slip. It's just that it's plastic. The mechanism used to lock it is quite good and should keep the teeth meshed reliably, but the plastic will wear and the lash that is inherent in this design will only grow. I wish they were metal and I wish the clamping mechanism pressure could be tightened.

On the plus side, the gear tooth arrangement is positive locking, shouldn't slip under normal use, and provides very fine angle selection.

If you are a home mechanic and need a repair/tuning stand for reasonable money, this is a good choice.

[update] Having used it a while now, I like quite a lot and have raised to a 4-star. I initially wanted it to be more rigid but after using a while I have become more confident in it. Still not wild about interlocking nylon gears but cost/benefit is key and so far the the locking system is just fine and this remains a good value.

[update 2: or ""D'oh!""] I have accidentally noticed that I can bind the seatpost while setting the height to keep the front wheel on the ground. This keeps the steering centered while creating a new three-point stability that is very nice to work on. It elevates the drive train for cleaning, adjusting and lubrication. The change in overall stability is remarkable. See latest picture.",10-02-2015

It's extremely easy to set up out of the box. I strongly recommend this, but it does have two issues (hence only four stars). First, the clamp opens far enough to be useful, but it would be convenient if it opened even further so it would be easier to get larger frame tubes in and out. Second, it has a tendency to tip over when I'm putting the bike in or out. That can easily be fixed by putting the weight on top of the legs that go along the floor.

It's light weight enough so that if necessary you can pick up both it and your bicycle and move them around with little effort. Very compact when folded up for easy storage in a closet. It's well constructed of good metal and high impact plastic parts. It you break this thing while using it you must have been to be doing something very wrong. A couple other points: The hold down clamp is rubber lined and holds my road bike very solidly. I'm restoring an old Fuji and this rack has been most helpful. I probably wouldn't have tackled this project with out it. I looked at several maintenance racks at shops in town before deciding on this one. The racks that were half the cost of the Venzo were also much more flimsy. Which is fine if you are looking for something flimsy. Others on the more expensive side appeared to be no better than this rack but they usually were heavier and somewhat cumbersome. This is very worth the price.,06-06-2015

I have experience with a friends Park Tool stand and I thought that I was going to go that route for sure. To save a bit of money, I searched for an alternative. I'm glad that I did. This bike rack is very impressive at it's price point. It was a breeze to set up, and seems very well built. If you're an avid bike mechanic, then this will probably wear down pretty quickly; some of the parts are plastic and I could see them wearing down with strenuous use. I like to do my own adjustments and bike work, and seeing as how my tool kit keeps expanding, not having a stand to work with was aggravating. I adjusted a friends mountain bike just the other day, and it performed very well. The only thing I might gripe is that it can be difficult to figure out exactly how much you need to turn the main clamp screw before you tighten it down. Don't spend a ton on the Blue stuff unless you're very serious. For once a week maintenance, this can't be beat!",05-29-2015

The rack arrived almost fully assembled, with just the tool tray needing attachment with a couple screws. (It was separate to fit in the shipping carton; but the stand folds neatly even with the tray in place.)  Fit and finish is excellent for the price. I was a bit worried about how stable the stand would be given its light weight, but the widespread legs provide a solid foundation once you have a bike attached. Quick-release clamps solidly lock the legs and height adjustment in place and can be changed quickly. The resin clamp adjusts easily and is far beefier than I expected; I didn't get the sense of any serious flex or play in it as I was working.

I'll update the review if I notice any issues after tuning the rest of the family's bikes, but so far this looks like a winner.",05-25-2015

No this will not withstand the assembly and repair of 30 bicycles a day.  However for working on your own bike this thing is just what is advertised.  Unlike a cheaper stand (that I returned) this one will lock at any angle because it has a spline tooth locking mech--and it worked!  Of course all the major arms and such are a type of nylon/plastic, but then again I don't plan on putting together 30 bikes a day like I did in my youth because my dad owned a bike shop.
It comes totally assembled except for the tray that is only held on with two thumb screws so it can be removed or attached very quickly.  Folds up small..  No it does not want to tip over either, seems very stable..  However I have it set up in a garage not in the yard or a pile of dirt either.

It collapses down for easy storage and transport.  My bike does wobble a little when its mounted, but for the work I do on my bike I don't mind.  One complaint is that the lever for the clamp on the seat tube does not clamp down enough.  You have to unscrew it some to open the jaws for the seat tube to fit in but then when you clamp it down its way too loose.  So you have to screw it tight again then clamp it down, not that big of a deal, but worth mentioning.  I would not recommend this stand to do a full overhaul on a bike as the clamps and such are a bit awkward, but for casual repairs and cleaning its excellent.",04-20-2015

I set it up quickly without even reading the instructions, and was working on my bike within 10 minutes (replacing the front derailleur).

The loss of 1 star was do to 2 nits.  The thumb screws that hold the tool holder tray on to the stand are too large head diameter to be able to tighten, the knurls on the head hit the post before the screw is tight, so the tray wobbles around, and the stand can be knocked over when doing hard work (getting the pedals off) if pushed fairly hard away and right or left from you.  It's stable against directly away, but it will rotate around either leg.  I own a 3D printer so I printed up a new end cap for the vertical post that has a couple of thumbs sticking out only 1.5 inches (so still inside the folded up envelope) and the stand got way more stable - and a spacer for the thumb screws so they get tight before running into the post - now mine is 5 stars.

I believe it came this way because I never was able to get the collar tight enough to stay attached to the lower post. It's a shame because I really like the stand otherwise. It feels like a sturdy stand for the price point but the plastic fittings don't seem up to par. I'm returning now and I just don't think I should try this one again.,03-01-2015

It's very lightweight, yet sturdy, and hold my bike securely when I work on it.  Its tripod design mean that it fits well into the corner of my room and doesn't take up too much room.  The tool tray isn't especially useful and was a pain to assemble.  Overall, I am quite pleased with my purchase.",02-24-2015
https://www.amazon.com/Bikehand-Mechanic-Bicycle-Repair-Stand/dp/B00D9B7OKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1,23,Sports and Outdoor,Bikehand Bike Repair Stand (Max 55 lbs) - Home Portable Bicycle Mechanics Workstand - for Mountain Bikes and Road Bikes Maintenance,4.6,4,Some quibbles but a good product,"All in all, this bike stand is a good value. It's not perfect, but for the price, I am all right with the imperfections.

1.  The instructions that come with the stand are pitiful. I was able to puzzle it out within a couple of minutes, but why should I have to scratch my head and try to solve a puzzle? It's not that hard to write instructions or refer customers to a video posted on a website. The fact that there is a customer-provided instructional video on YouTube shows that fellow customers care more than the company about this. I purchased this in July of 2014 so maybe by now the company has deigned to produce its own video or provide real instructions.

2.  The design of the cam on the clamp to hold the bike is defective. When the jaws of the clamp are open wide enough to fit the top tube into the clamp, the jaws don't clamp down enough when I throw the lever. It needs a bigger cam. So after I put the top tube into the clamp and throw the lever, I have twirl it a couple of times to get the jaws closer together. A properly designed cam would allow the user to have the jaws open wide enough to get the top tube in while at the same time being able to clamp the bike in place just by throwing the lever to the opposite position.

3.  Even with the bike firmly clamped in place, the whole thing wobbles a bit when I am turning the pedal by hand to get the rear wheel going . This is not a complaint per se, just an observation of an imperfection. I don't think that any bike stand in this price range (and perhaps double or triple the price) can keep a bike perfectly still when turning the pedal by hand (unless there is a stiff post that is bolted to, or embedded in, a concrete floor).

In theory, the seat tube if the best place to clamp with the jaws of the bike stand. One thing that user manuals warn against when using a bike stand is crushing the top tube by excessive clamping force (not an issue with the seat post). Given the resin composition of the jaws and the width of the jaws, which allows force to be spread out, I am not too concerned about that with this bike stand. I find that the bike is better balanced and therefore more stable when I place the top tube in the clamp, rather than the seat post.

TIP:  When I put the top tube in the post, I have to contend with the cable that runs to the rear brake. The clamp looks like it would press the cable against the top tube, which doesn't seem like a good idea to me. So I use the quick release on the rear brake to make the cable slack and move it out of the way when I clamp the bike in the stand.

Even with a less-than-perfect product, it's a heck of a lot easier to work on the bike with this stand than without a stand. So for the budget-minded, this stand will stand you in good stead.",02-19-2015

The only thing I had to do out of the box was tighten a of the clamp a little to keep the telescoping main post from slipping and it was set to use. The only other thing worth mentioning is that the balance of my bike was better when clamped by the top post instead of the seat post as pictured. Since these are both more comments than complaints in any way, this stand is near enough to perfect for anyone who doesn't actually own their own bike shop, in my opinion.",02-02-2015

Received my stand yesterday, and decided because today is raining to oil both my bikes. I own a carbon fiber road bike and a Walmart mongoose mountain bike.

First off, up till this point I have been putting my bike on the car bike rack to do any work or adjustments. Thats a pain, trust me.  So, the reason I purchased this stand.

First, setting it up. Basically you release some quick release's, drop legs. Lift to height. That should have been easy, but I must be dumb as dirt. Took me longer then I expected.  For some reason, I had issues getting the legs far enough down to make the stand straight. My fault, not the stand. Because it is sitting straight now.

The bikes. First I put up my road bike. Lighter bike, so it was easy to hold up while I figured out the release's and levers for where you want the bike to be.  And also for clamping onto the seat post.  Not to bad.  Held the bike easily as I was oiling it.

Now to the mountain bike. That sucker is a beast. Royal pain my my butt for getting that beast on to the stand.  I had to raise my seat so that I could clamp it.  This beast caused me to tighten up the quick release's on the stand more, because my bike did shift.  Neither is a show stopper, just lessons learned for the next time I throw that bike up on the stand.

The stand does not appear to be cheap in any definition of the word. It looks to be quite sturdy.  I knocked it over once, but I knocked it backwards without a bike on the stand to hold it down.

I was only going to give it 4 stars because I wish there would have been better directions, but what the heck. They were detailed enough. Release quick release to drop legs. Release quick release to raise/lower height.  So, the 3 stars goes to me. and the 5 stars goes to the stand.",07-19-2014

The stand is lightweight and sets up quickly. So far I managed to adjust the brakes and the rear shifting mechanism and had good results. The repair stand keeps the bike steady so I can work on it without the bike falling over and I can work at a more comfortable height.,07-17-2014

After my bike slipping for the umpteenth time, I decided it was time to step up and get a real bike stand. I usually try to shop my local bike shops, but I didn't want to spend $300 on a professional bike stand. No one nearby could match the quality, price, and features of this stand. It arrived ready to go. There's convenient quick-release type levers that hold everything at various positions. The only assembly required was attached the parts tray. The parts tray is a very nice touch. It has several compartments for separating parts and it has holes around the perimeter that you can use to hold screwdrivers, pliers, and other tools.

The top tube clamp does take a few minutes to get used to. For some bikes, I have to unscrew the tube clamp a little to fit the bike's top tube in and the screw the clamp down a little before locking the lever on top.

It's very light and even though I haven't folded it back up yet, I'm glad it breaks down into something small I could carry. I would suggest finding a bag that could carry the stand and the parts tray.",07-17-2014

Could be a bit stiffer, but for the price and ability to fold up for space savings I suppose this is to be expected.

(It's amazing how much smarter you get as you get older; at my age I am now almost a genius, if only in my own mind.)  After reading all the really great reviews, I narrowed my bike work stand selection down to the Bikehand Cycle Pro Mechanic Bicycle Repair Stand.

You can see the quality workmanship that went into this stand the minute you slide it out of the box.  While the included instruction sheet leaves a lot to be desired, the stand itself doesn't.  It easily holds my husky-framed, man's, 26"" Diamondback mountain bike at shoulder-level.  The two foldable legs are well braced and long enough to make for a wobble-free stand.  The head can be angled to allow you to tilt the bike, if need be, and the stand comes with an attachable tool or parts tray.  Because the legs fold back up and lock in place, and the main (vertical) barrel slides down for storage, it takes up very little garage space when not in use.  And, the polished finish is both practical and easy on the eye.

One last word about the somewhat limited instruction sheet: Since the stand comes fully assembled, it only takes one or two uses  to figure out the simple adjustments needed to use the stand.  This really is a five-star product.",07-06-2014

The fold up aluminum frame is sturdy, easy to fold up and store and it will handle all of my bike ranging in size from 14"" kids trainer to a full size mountain bike. The clamp & its orientation could be a little easier to adjust but it may be as much me not doing it correctly as it is the design. Regardless, that does not effect my satisfaction with the product.

It is largely plastic and has some flex. It might fall over given the wrong circumstances. Your grandkids won't be using this in 50 years.....

However, it looks the same as a stand offered on Amazon for $10 more, and is similar to the Nashbar 360.

It isn't as solid as the Park, and if I used a stand every day I wouldn't buy this-

However, I love how it folds for storage, it is acceptable for the work I do (just rebuilt the oldest son's stumpjumper from the BB up), & it for sure beats flipping your bike upside down to work on it.

It is great for cleaning & lubing your chain, adjusting brakes, changing pads, adjusting the mechs, installing bottle cages,replacing your crankset, or anything else you can do to a bike. I've had my Iron Donkey mountain bike (30 plus pounds) in this stand, and while it was not rock steady, it worked.

It's very stable once you get the bike on, the only thing I do have to do is step on one of the feet when placing the bike.  Once it's there it's rock solid.  The great part about it is you can fully adjust the bike while it is ON the stand in just about any conceivable angle.  It is also easy to fold and store.  I plan to take it with me on RAGBRAI (bike ride across Iowa) this summer.  The little shelf you can connect is also really nice for holding little parts.

Well, after taking it out of the box, and a total of 5 minutes to set it up, I was impressed by the ease of setup and the weight is half of my pcs-9. It clamps the frame tight, I used my seatpost on my Trek Navigator(not a light bike), there is no chance of it tipping like someone posted earlier. It has great balance. There is a little play in the rotation gear, but not enough to make me worry. All in all I think it's a great buy. Park is the best, but this is second in my opinion. Buy it, you won't be disapointed.",01-13-2014

It has saved my back and my stress levels. This stand makes repairs and maintenance so much easier. Installing and uninstalling parts like racks and things of that nature is now a breeze.

I have had this stand for over a year now, and I love it. I just cleaned and relubed a chain in no time by myself. This stand holds up to beatings and works just as fine as any other bike stand on the market.",12-08-2013
