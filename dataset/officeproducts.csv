When you take them out of the package they are sort of flat.  I don't like that they don't come to a point on the tip for easy highlighting, but will make do.  That is why I took off a star.  I like that they don't dry up.  I also like the different colors.  They don't seem to bleed through text book pages and that is great.

""Gel"" sounded promising, and I assumed it would be a thick liquid like gel pens. I was very surprised to open the cap and discover that these highlighters consist of a rough chunk of some translucent waxy substance. In texture it is much like a soft crayon, with the same fuzziness to the outlines. There is no nib, just a large oblong block of this so-called ""gel"" which wears down irregularly across its surface. Consequently it is impossible to get nice clean lines, and almost impossible even to properly aim the thing. I thought I could put up with it, but maybe I'm too much of a perfectionist. I'm sick of rough waxy smears that sometimes barely correspond to the line I'm attempting to highlight. I'm going to buy some better highlighters and ""forget"" these in a classroom. Maybe a less picky person will find them who can appreciate them more.",04-06-2018

But the tips are poorly designed, it's extremely difficult to highlight what you intend to without marking the wrong line or more than one line of text at a time.  The tips are very odd-shaped and as it wears down becomes much larger and more blunt.  Even fresh out of the box, it's nearly impossible to see what text the tip is landing on when you put it to the paper.  If you're going to try to highlight any text smaller than 12 point, this is absolutely NOT the highlighter for you.  Highlighting with these is the equivalent of performing surgery with a dull butter knife.  Great idea, but the design is horrible.",01-10-2018

After a little over a year most of the colors have dried out so I purchased a new set.  As I planned on using the original set until all the highlighters ran out I totally expected there to be a variance in colors between the older pack and newer pack.  Simply stated, the difference was so subtle it was barely noticeable.  In fact, it was only noticeable in the dark purple darker blue.  This was simply because they were so bold that lighter fonts were a bit harder to see.  In fact a ""problem"" I had with my first pack until I eventually wore the colors in.
In short I'm surprised as to how well the colors match, so I, of course, am happy.
The one thing I will say is after about a year of removing and replacing the cap, the caps come off far easier than they originally did.  But again, by the time the tops were barely staying in place, it was well beyond time to purchase new highlighters.  At one point I was coloring just to highlight a simple line of text, rather than one simple pass.",10-31-2017

I use these currently while I am studying for the Bar Exam, so I use them on normal printer paper when I am grading my practice essays.  I love the bright colors and how florescent they are!  They also don't seem to run down too quickly.
However, I am right handed but have always written ""like a lefty"" so I smear everything I write because I drag my hand across everything I write above.  Unfortunately, these highlighters make my smearing even worse and I get it all over everything because they don't ""dry"" as they're gel.  If I wrote like a normal person they would likely be great.
Also I have to mention, somehow I got the pink one all over my white sheet while I was studying one night and without any bleach or extra stain remover it came out in one washing, so I was pleasantly surprised about that.",02-14-2017

But I haven't had a problem with the ink bleeding through paper. Most of the colors are vibrant too, which I love. A few of them are pretty dark and even a little difficult to read through, but out of the ten colors, I'd say that statement (that they're dark) applies to three of them, tops--the red one, the dark blue one, and the dark pink one.

I'm constantly highlighting notes, research, etc. I must have some kind of fetish for highlighters because I have far more in tubs and drawers that I'll ever use, but I keep buying them anyway. These highlighters are quite different than the standard felt-tip type, they have a kind of oblong/rounded tip and using them has a somewhat different feel. They definitely glide easier, but they don't seem to put down as thick a layer of yellow as others so. Still, they work nicely and I think I'm starting to prefer them just because they glide faster. We'll see. They do seem to have a lot of ink in them and that nice.

Unfortunately, many of the colors are too dark to be a full highlighter.  Now that is if you are using them in the context of writing.

I use these highlighters in my pen and ink artwork.  I treat them as a transparent pen, using either the tip or chisel part of the end, they run a solid, even line, without any of the skips that I have come across with other Brands of highlighters.  These are definitely a wet highlighter.  However, they are quick drying.  As a lefty, my hand would be a rainbow of colors if they did not dry quickly.

A result of being a wet pen, you do tend to go through the ink rather quickly.  Just like Sharpies fine point, and ultra-fine point pens, these highlighters will also puddle if left in a spot too long.

They may be a little more expensive than other highlighters, but you get what you pay for, and I think the price point for these pens is dead on.",08-04-2016

But the reason I have to keep buying them is that they run out more quickly than many other kinds and brands. I am highlighting a textbook to review for a test and the 200 pages so far have killed 7 of these highlighters (okay, several of them were not full when I started, but they weren't all empty either). I don't know what planet the ""lasted a year with heavy use"" reviewer is from, but I'd like to live there. The nice thing about these highlighters, however, is that the clear barrel makes it very easy to tell when the marker is going to die. Which is important, because these go from 100% ink quality to a wispy ghost fart within a single page of highlighting.

""But then why,"" you might ask, ""do you keep buying them?"" Good question, review reader. Other than the short lifespan, these are the best highlighters I've ever used. The ink is vibrant and delightful. I love the range of colors. As others have mentioned, the darker colors can be equal parts highlighter and CIA redactor, but my youthful eyesight handles it fine. The highlighting is smooth and the tip doesn't wear down or get smooshed. The barrel itself is comfortable to hold and the cap has a satisfying snap sound when it is replaced on the end of the marker. The clear barrel is great for checking ink levels, especially if you're on the go and you need to make sure you've got enough highlighting power to last you while you're out. The end of the marker allows you to clip it onto something but I've never utilized this feature - not enough highlighting-while-spelunking I guess.

Except ... (Updated 6/27/2017)","UPDATE - June 27, 2017 - One year and 3 weeks after buying these highlighters, which I still love, in terms of their day to day function, I was rather shocked to find MOLD growing on the tips of two of them. Having a very significant allergy to mold, I immediately threw those two away. The other eight showed no signs of mold. I've been using highlighters since 1980 and this is the first time in 37 years I've ever seen a highlighter grow mold. Perhaps the ink formula doesn't resist the mold growth as well as other highlighter inks, but that's just a guess on my part. I'll be checking my other brands of highlighters to see if any have developed mold. I did a bit of searching online and this is not unheard of, but it was a first for me. Takes a bit of the edge off my joy over these otherwise great highlighters.

BEST highlighters I've ever used, bar none. They don't bleed through any of the papers I've used them on so far (including some that were pretty thing) and the vibrant colors are attractive and intense. I love using highlighters and have for years and of the many types and brands I've used, these are my new absolute favorites. The caps lock on securely for a tight fit and the color goes down in a steady flow that's really effective and attractive. NOTE - the nib is spring loaded, so if you push down TOO hard (probably without meaning to) you might get a sudden flood of ink, so do use caution in that respect. But as long as you don't over do it, I think you'll be extremely pleased with these highlighters. Awesome range of colors and I use them all, where as with other brands I can only use the light ones as the darks are too dark. Even the dark hues here are very usable. I have tested them on a wide range of papers and they have not failed (good color, no bleed through) yet. Highly recommend.",07-15-2016

Regardless of the hype or ecstatic reviews of other highlighters, every one I've ever tried suffered from one of these two defects....

1. The liquid ones bleed through high-quality Indaia paper, which is what my Bible pages are made of.  This makes the back side of the pages  look as though someone had used them as a spaghetti bib. Even the hyped ""no-bleed"" ones bleed through really thin paper.

2. The waxy, crayon-ish ones leave such a faint line that I have to bear down almost to the crayon's breaking point to get a highlight that is, uh, actually a highlight. Not fun.  The Sharpies will not bleed through a Kleenex, let alone a Bible page.

These Sharpie  highlighters seem to be a perfect combination of the two.  They ARE waxy, and, to the touch, feel just like a crayon.  But apparently they have just enough gel pigment (or whatever) that the line they lay down is bright, with no pressure required.  In short, they're just about perfect. The blue one is a little bit pale, but, hey, there are 4 other colors.

I recently went back to school for a second master's degree, so I bought new highlighters, and these were one of the brands I bought, because I like the liquid highlighters. The ink runs out within literally 2 hours of using them! I actually emailed the Sharpie company about them running out so quickly. They emailed me back and apologized and asked which highlighters had run out. At the time it was I had only used two of them, the pink and blue, so they sent me just those two highlighters. Of course, as I used the others, they all ran out within one of two uses as well. The only way I was able to get them to last more than 2 or 3 hours of reading, is if I immediately put the cap back on after highlighting something AND hold the highlighter with the tip pointing up, so the ink does not soak into the tip.
They are NOT worth the money you spend at all! It's sad, because I love the colors! I like having highlighters in colors other than the typical pink, orange, green, and yellow.

I have used so many brands of highlighters and I'm always disappointed that they run out of function before they're truly out of ink.
With these, I know I won't run out of function before I run out of gel.
The gel, as far as I've experienced, doesn't latch on to other surfaces as much as I thought it would (ie highlighting a book, closing the book, and opening it to find the gel has passed to the touching pages). I am also really happy with how easy it is to maneuver. I won some free gel highlighters from school and it was weird because I would think I'd be highlighting one line and it would actually be a different line. These ones are much more easy to see what you're doing (in my opinon).",10-10-2015

I am an accounting student, so I am a huge writing utensil snob. They do not bleed through the page like normal highlighters.

I personally don't like marker-style highlighters at all, because of how they bleed and mark up your hands and also the squeaky sound they make when you highlight certain types of paper. They do take a while to get used to, but as others have said, they never dry out so you can leave them uncapped and they won't roll off your desk due to their shape. Love love love!

A good half of them are just way too dark to ever be useful when highlighting. ALL of the colors are darker than a ""standard"" highlighter color, so even the pink, blue, and green can leave you with some difficulty seeing what you just highlighted. The red is so dark it's practically a marker, and the blue, purple, and magenta colors are also way too dark to even think about using. That leaves six functional highlighters, of which I only feel truly okay with using the yellow, orange, and pink ones. Maybe occasionally blue, green, and salmon ones if I'm forced to use that many colors in one page.

Point blank, I dislike these, but I spent ten bucks on them so I'm going to use them. I couldn't recommend them to anybody. Just buy yourself normal highlighters that aren't so dark.

The photo is taken pretty close to the page so that you can see the text on it. Try leaning back in your chair and reading the ones with darker markers to see what it'd be like looking at your notes from a normal distance with highlighting that dark.",04-06-2015

I don't like them but they're okay. They get the job done, just with some complications.

Some of the caps don't lock onto the back when I'm using the highlighter, which is inconvenient when I'm trying to read/highlight on the bus and don't have anywhere to put the cap.

Also, they're oblong-shaped, which, in my opinion, isn't ideal for highlighting. Sometimes I get this bright, skinny, little line; other times, I'll get a fat, light shade of color. I have to rotate the highlighter between highlights to keep somewhat of a consistent shade going.

Furthermore, they get these weird little neon-colored slivers of highlighter that just fall onto whatever it is that I'm highlighting. I have to have a napkin beside me when I use these highlighters so that I can wipe these weird little shavings off of the tip of the highlighter.

Finally, they aren't lasting nearly as long as I thought they would. I read a review on here, in which someone claimed that they lasted like two years. My schooling requires a massive amount of highlighting, so I was only expecting them to last a semester, even though I only use them for two of my books. Based on how much of the highlighters I've used so far, if you're highlighting about 100 pages a week, I'd estimate these highlighters lasting about one semester (15 weeks).

I much prefer BIC Brite Liner+ highlighters because, even though I burn through them like crazy (granted, I use them for four of my books), they don't have weird slivers of stuff coming off and they have a consistent bright neon highlight.",02-13-2015

Also, because they are gel, these never dry out, even under the heaviest of use.  The only negative I have is that, unlike traditional markers, the cap doesn't fasten onto the other end while you're using it.

The manufacturers state that their new ink-free gel stick technology will provide their strongest smear protection across pen, marker inks and ink jet printouts, and that it will not bleed through paper; that it works as a highlighter on all paper surfaces including glossy and thin papers, magazines and Bibles.  They add that this technology writes as long as a traditional pen-style highlighter, and that the pen will not dry out if left uncapped.  Furthermore, they guarantee the item if it is returned for replacement.  They are here delivered two to a pack.

As of 2002, more than 200 million Sharpies had been sold worldwide. Sharpie was originally a name designating a permanent marker that was launched in 1974 by the Sanford Ink Company: it was the first pen-style permanent marker.  In 1990 Sharpie was acquired by The Newell Companies (later Newell Rubbermaid) as part of Sanford, a leading manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments.

These highlighters come in a great range of ten different colors, including some not normally found elsewhere. My favorite is the red which is a nice, dark red that shows up well for really important highlights. The dark blue and the purple are a bit dark, but they are nice to have as well--in general all of the colors are intense. These are my standard go-to highlighters with a thinner tip (as opposed to a wide tip) for reading average size print.

I like that they last a long time and that you can tell exactly when they are about to run dry. They can be stored with the top down when they get to that almost-dry point and thus you can get a little bit more life from them.

Highly recommended.

Update 6.8.2015
I have burned through probably 5 packages of these markers in highlighting well over 3000 pages worth of text. (Calibri 11pt font). I STILL swear by these markers. I'll agree with some comments; there are some colors that are darker than others and that does impact legibility somewhat; however, if you are applying light pressure, this should resolve quite a bit of the readability issues. The only color that annoys me is the darker purple; regardless of what package, the color always seems to smear and clump up on the paper. Other than that; I swear by these bad boys!",12-28-2013

I Love it.
I like these a lot better than the liquid highlighters, but mainly for the reasons other reviewers said they didn't like it.

Well, here's my list of Pros and Cons, so you decide if its right for you.

Pros:
- Colors are not too dark.  Yellow is fine on liquid highlighters, but I find all other colors TOO dark.  They actually obscure the text.
- Less bleeding onto other pages
- Less smearing
- Doesn't dry out, so you can leave them out and you know you will get to use the entire stick.
- Mine smells good too!

Cons:
- The only con that I found is someone mentioned they are not precise.  The gel wears unevenly, so you must rotate the pen to make it wear evenly (like tire tread).
Since there is not a fine tip on the gel, hightlighting a precise area is not as easy.  But, that doesn't bother me.  I use the highlighter like a crayon, not a calligraphy pen.

- I haven't run into the sticky pages (giggity) that other users have mentioned, but I guess if you rub it hard enough (giggity, giggity), that could happen.",09-12-2013

I use them at work all the time. I'm a gentle highlighter, I don't cram them into the paper, so I have no problems. They took me a few days to get used to because the gel doesn't always keep the chiseled tip like the other highliters. Once I got used to them, it was like highliting heaven. I like the blue color because it's not very vivid and is nice for subtle highlights, while the yellow color is very neon and stands out extremely well. These also work amazingly on post it notes. They have a nice smell to them, I personally don't find it very offensive. Two great things about these highliters: 1) they will not roll off your desk, they are oblong shaped instead of round; 2) they will never dry out if left uncapped, they will just sit there and be awesome, waiting for you to come back and use them.

I've owned them for about 18 months, and while I use highlighters infrequently, I love having a wide variety of colors to choose from so that when I'm marking up pages I can create my own shorthand to note different topics using color.

A few things you should know about these pens:

With darker colors such as purple and blue, it's definitely difficult to read black text underneath.

The highlighters let go of a lot of ink, so if you like to move your highlighter slowly, you can leave the paper a little bit damp. I actually think this is a benefit because I move quickly and hate streaky, dry highlighters.

There is also a 5-pack available which has the most basic colors - pink, yellow, orange, blue, green. I find that I use those colors the most anyway, as many of the ones in this 10-pack are very dark to use as highlighters, like the purple and blue shades. You can't really read text underneath.

While the fact that these highlighters lean a little to the wet end of things means that you'll probably need to replace them sooner, I'd much rather have that than the alternative, of a highlighter which runs a little dry and ends up giving a streaky highlight. I really like the streamlined, not too bulky tip of these pens, and would definitely recommend them.",12-04-2012

I actually ran out of the red in my first pack because I used it to grade papers! These highlighters are really good both as highlighters and as actual markers. There is very little bleed-through, even with Bible pages. This is true even for the dark colors (red, purple, dark blue).

This is an excellent set of markers for use with Bible studies that emphasize verses on specific topics (for instance, what does the Bible say about lying? Choose one color, highlight several verses in that color and mark them with post-it flags). Frankly, they are also just a lot of fun to draw/color with, because the ink flow is very smooth and they are quite vibrant.

As for the markers running out too quickly; I did not experience that with my first package, and even though I've highlighted close to 100 verses so far with this set, you can hardly tell I've even used them. I think the key is closing them quickly and keeping them tightly capped. I know you can very easily leave them not-quite-closed which will bleed out the ink.

You cant even control where you are highlighting... its pretty much a guess. On top of that the tip is so broad and malleable that it is impossible to highlight precisely.

I surely would have loved to find a review on these guys.

I use fountain pens. I just love them. They even make writing a check an enjoyable experience and, no matter the obstacles the modern world is creating to fountain users, I will never renounce to writing with a fountain pen. So said, one of the problems to resolve is the factual impossibility to use any of the highlighters on the market because they dissolve the water-based ink of the fountain pen producing unacceptable smears. I have learned how to get around this problem in several ways, but never stopped keeping an eye open for highlighters for fountain pens. Recently, I found out from fountain-pen-chat-room that Sharpie (which I like a lot) was making a gel dry highlighter. Had to tour three Staples before finding the one carrying the Sharpie gel highlighter and only in fluorescent yellow. I fell in love with the first use: no bleeding, no smearing! The next step was coming to Amazon and see what other colors were available and buy all of them in doubles (we never know should they disappear!).

My taking about the Sharpie's gel highlighters is the following.
At all effects, they are wax-based pencils that have been make transparent, thus they work as highlighters. You have to get used to the waxy feeling that will be especially evident if you highlight big pieces. I do not mind it and I actually appreciate that there is no leeking on the back of the page.

Colors: the vibrancy is provided only by the fluorescent yellow gel highlighter. No other color is ""fluorescent."" However, I like the orange a lot: it gives a definitive accent and it distributes well. Pink is a strong color/accent, but do not distribute very homogeneously, while green and blue are pretty weak colors and also not distribute not very homogeneously.

Use and results: if you keep in mind that you are using wax-pencil equivalent - which is what these gel highlighters are - you will not be disappointed by the waxy feeling, the not overly homogeneous tract, or that they will produce fragments if you push them hard enough: all of the above are properties of wax pencils, i.e. they are not defects: the Sharpie gel highlighters works as they are supposed to do.

Very easy to use, will not dry if left uncapped, will not bleed on the other side of the paper no matter how thin or cheap that is.

They are not very precise since the tip is round and large. Because of the transparency, making a smaller and sharper tip may not be feasible. In any case, if you take your time you will keep within the lines otherwise you will not.

Overall I love them and I am so very happy that Sharpie is making them: they are not perfect, but neither is any other highlighter. At the end, you'll have to decide what to use for doing what you want or need doing. I want to highlights agendas, journals, personal and work notes written with fountain pens and using water-soluble ink. For me the Sharpie gel highlighters are great and resolved a major problem. I have been using them extensively for more than two weeks now and I am more than pleased: I am thankful!",02-04-2012

I go through about a ream of paper every couple of months, and that is in addition to texts and lecture syllabi.  In fact I spend so much time writing and highlighting I get bruises on my fingers and hands from where they hit the pen and paper.  All that said...this is the only type of highlighter I will purchase now.  No they are not perfect, and until you get used to them they can be a bit temperamental as to the position of the highlighting.  BUT they do not run through pages, at all.  The highlighting actually stays on only one side of the page.  They also actually last a fairly long time, I don't burn through these nearly as quickly as I would have thought.  I have learned that due to my enthusiasm I tend to press too hard, resulting in excess gel coming off, so I simply ad a page between the two I have just finished before turning the page so that the excess doesn't rub onto the adjacent page.

I was really hoping these would be my highlighter of choice. After using it for a while I began to noticed many flaws that accompanied these type of highlighters. The ""Gel"" design is different and interesting enough to draw me in, but the actual application of it on paper is pretty much useless. While I'm using the marker, very tiny pieces of gel would come off. Another problem is that the gel would run out really quick, making me have to keep turning the top to expose more gel, and if I tried to retract some back, pieces would get cut off and falls out. So after a week, I just gave up and threw the markers away.

Pros:
1. Easy to glide
2. Bright

Cons:
1. Leaves pieces of gel around while highlighting
2. Gel pieces come off during retraction.
3. The part that is highlighted is somewhat sticky.
4. Doesn't smear ink, but the highlighting itself can be smear when in contact.
5. No physical/definite ""chisel"" shape when you need it. You have to shape it yourself.
6. More expensive than your typical highlighter.",01-30-2012

I generally overlook those flaws, simply because it doesn't bleed through or transfer when you turn a page right after marking it (with the exception of those pesky flakes, which tend to get smeared onto the back of the previous page).  The thing that bothers me the most about these is that the cap doesn't always stick to the bottom while you're using it, and occasionally gets lost.  Granted, these don't dry out like a ""regular"" highlighter, but having to be careful of the end is a little annoying.  If they could figure out a way to replace the cap with a clicky-top, and still have a way to advance the ""gel"" as you use it, it would be much better.  Another slight downside is that once you highlight, it's a little hard to write over.  Will I buy them again?  Probably.

I use liquid ink pens and these gel highlighters cover with no issues.  They are smooth, easy to use, and clear. I use them daily at work for small tasks, and I'm only on my second one of the pack.

My only criticism: becuase the gel tip is similar to a crayon tip you don't always get a consistant highlight (height varies from a skinny line to a bold line depending on how you hold the highlighter & the wear on the tip).  Also, once highlighted, you can't write over them (the gel dries and it won't accept ink).

I often highlight my books so that I can get back to salient passages. I was excited to get these markers as I read that they don't permeate paper and were easy to use.  They are not easy to use at all.  They feel more like a crayon or a wax stick than a highlighter and the feel of the marker on the paper is waxy as well.  Most of all, it is hard to highlight the line that you want to.  The marker is so hard to use that half the time I find myself highlighting the line below the line I'm trying to highlight.  I don't plan on getting these again or recommending them to anyone else.",04-23-2011

However, I still gave them a four for a few reasons, the color selection being one, and a few other quirks that make them not perfect for everyone.  They are unusual.  They write like soft, translucent crayons, which means you will not always get precision lines or consistent markings.  Once you get used to how you have to angle and adjust though, they are wonderful.  They do not bleed through, at all, ever.  And once completely dry they do not smear or remain sticky.  But, as others have said, they have the potential to transfer from one page to the adjacent one when the book is closed.  If you are more light-handed, that would not be a problem, but if like me you are a ferocious highlighter then the same thing happens that would with crayons, you leave small wax residue spots that may squish onto the next page when the book is closed.  Again, this can be avoided with certain technique and care, but it doesn't bother me enough to waste my time thinking about on a day to day basis.  They last reasonably long, though again this will depend on how much pressure you apply when you highlight.  For me personally, the pink is too dark, I feel if it were a little more translucent or lighter in color it would be a more usable pen.  Hope this helps those of you, like me, who know way too much about highlighters, and go through more than you'd care to admit in a semester.  Man, medical school makes you geeky...",03-19-2011

This one isn't as good.  First, there's a small hint of negative oder from the gel but most won't notice or find that objectionable. Second, the label on the pen (name) rubs off on your fingers if your hands are at all moist. That problem can probably be wiped away quickly. However, a third issue is more problematic.  Although the ink doesn't appear to bleed through the page, if you close your book quickly after applying and reopen to the same page, you are likely to find that it sometimes bleeds to the opposite page. The other gel highlighter I owned didn't do that.

Lots of disapointment!,"This review is regarding the cartridge used on an HP 4500 printer that is in excellent condition. I usually print approximately 20 pages per week in a small home office and have always used HP cartridges until recently. For years I've been frustrated by how expensive ink is and how fast they need to be replaced. It makes my reasonably priced printer an expensive piece of equipment. HP claims approximately 200 printed pages per cartridge, which is about 7 1/2 cents per page. I'm not sure what they mean by ""approximately,"" but I believe we should get within 20% of their rating either way; 180 to 220 pages. Then, I did some work for a client that included being reimbursed for supplies, so I had to log every page I printed for months. After using 5 of the regular size HP cartridges, they averaged less than 150 pages. In other words, I paid about 10 cents per page. Wow! That's a big difference if you print a lot. I scoured the Internet to read other user's experiences, talked to HP, and bought cartridges from several sources before writing this review. Many other users report a similar experience to mine; it prints far fewer pages than HP advertises. Nobody commented they printed more than 200 pages, but it's less likely they would mention it online; so I decided to ignore it. I tried a couple of re-manufactured brands and did not see much of a difference in performance or quality, although one of them leaked slightly when I tried to install it and had to be thrown away. However after averaging the cost, they are still cheaper. My final decision is that the product from this vendor seemed to work as well as those I purchased through other sellers, but HP cartridges in general have a problem with meeting the buyer's expectations.",03-03-2018

The printer gets a workout and these 901 cartridges produce nice looking reports.

Reviewers sometimes give these units a lower rating because HP forces you to buy them and the units do not hold tons of ink, but that seems unfair to the cartridge.

Get The HP 901XL Instead...,"Having purchased an HP 4500 officejet a while back I also picked up some ink for it. 901 color and 2 - 901 black  cartridges(family does a lot of B&W printing)  I am not impressed at all with the 901 black.  It is substandard at best and produces very  mixed results.

Usually we print stuff on FAST (economy) and while the cartridge is rated for 200 pages, we actually got around 250-300 on the first one which puts it at around 125-150 for Normal.  (Usually fast/economy uses half the ink as it only does a single pass instead of two or three)  The strange part is.. the second cartridge we got was terrible performance.  I estimate by around 150 Fast/Economy the cartridge was starting to show it was almost out of ink already which would put it at around 75-100 pages normal!?

I was a bit shocked because there was such a deviation.  I did some research and found out that HP rates their Cartridges using an ISO standard Text document. They test on a J4580 printer which is an INK SAVER printer. If you do not own a J4580 then obviously you will get different results.

Because it is rated on a Text document keep in mind, print out a page that is loaded with black bars(like a bar graph) it will devour your ink; yet print out a page that has only a small amount of text you could go for 300+ pages easily.  I rarely complain about ink cartridges but I must say HP really should put some more ink into the standard 901 black; considering a 901XL has over 3x the rating (200 vs 700). Plus they should rate them using a ""Standard"" printer not an Ink Saver printer.  VERY MISLEADING !!

OVERALL
Avoid the 901 black!!  While they perform just fine and do have black ink in it that works, the cartridges performance is determined by how much black you print per page not by # of pages.  I would recommend instead spending the extra money and getting the 901XL black which is rated for 700 pages.  Once I got one of those I found I was able to print an entire ream of paper (500 pages) and the cartridge was still 50% full (all on economy/fast)  So despite paying twice the price I already DOUBLED my output compared to a 901 standard

In short.. avoid!!  get the 901XL as it will pay for itself.",06-14-2011

I have come out of the light of blank paper, and into the dark of true black ink. I have experienced an epiphany, a true realization of the meaning of life. Either that, or the crack I just smoked has finally kicked in.

Actually, what you want to do is buy these so you can use the scanner since these all-in-one devices often won't work at all if there's no ink in them. What you can get with one of HP's all-in-one devices like a scanner/fax machine is a not-very expensive (under $100) sheet-feeder scanner with OCR software that can be used to move documents off paper and into your computer.

But if you want to do inexpensive printing, this is okay for people doing less than 30-50 pages a month, or just doing small jobs (like printing envelopes or small batches of business cards where you change the design). If you go above maybe 50 pages a month HP is the second worst-cost printing provider (only Lexmark is consistently more expensive than HP), Brother and Epson are much cheaper on a per-page basis.

You can find flatbed combined scanner/printer combos for around $40. I bought one of HP's all-in-one printers that use this because it had a sheet feeder and when I need to scan several consecutive documents I use it. I don't do a lot of print outs, I think the estimate of around 100 pages/black in this cartridge is about right. For everything above very small printing volumes (30-100 pages/month) you probably want something other than HP. If your printing costs are running less than about 30 pages a month who cares, this will probably do fine and you'll get about 3 months out of it for ten bucks.",04-16-2011

It was only a little over a hundred dollars, so I knew ink would be expensive, especially from using previous HP models.  I don't use it a great deal, but after about 200 pages, it ran out of black ink. The color ink lasted a little longer, but that's because I usually write letters without much color.  Actually, that doesn't bother me, although I have read that most printers will have ink that lasts longer.  The secret to this ink from HP is to buy through Amazon from `used' or `refurbished' sellers.  You can save nearly 50% on costs and some give you free shipping.  That's what I ended up doing.  It looks exactly like a brand new cartridge.  I would recommend that if you want quality color photographs, you will need to buy a high quality (and more expensive) printer.

Lots of disapointment!,"This review is regarding the cartridge used on an HP 4500 printer that is in excellent condition. I usually print approximately 20 pages per week in a small home office and have always used HP cartridges until recently. For years I've been frustrated by how expensive ink is and how fast they need to be replaced. It makes my reasonably priced printer an expensive piece of equipment. HP claims approximately 200 printed pages per cartridge, which is about 7 1/2 cents per page. I'm not sure what they mean by ""approximately,"" but I believe we should get within 20% of their rating either way; 180 to 220 pages. Then, I did some work for a client that included being reimbursed for supplies, so I had to log every page I printed for months. After using 5 of the regular size HP cartridges, they averaged less than 150 pages. In other words, I paid about 10 cents per page. Wow! That's a big difference if you print a lot. I scoured the Internet to read other user's experiences, talked to HP, and bought cartridges from several sources before writing this review. Many other users report a similar experience to mine; it prints far fewer pages than HP advertises. Nobody commented they printed more than 200 pages, but it's less likely they would mention it online; so I decided to ignore it. I tried a couple of re-manufactured brands and did not see much of a difference in performance or quality, although one of them leaked slightly when I tried to install it and had to be thrown away. However after averaging the cost, they are still cheaper. My final decision is that the product from this vendor seemed to work as well as those I purchased through other sellers, but HP cartridges in general have a problem with meeting the buyer's expectations.",03-03-2018

That was on 1/19/14.  Today, the same cartridge ran out of ink and it's only 2/3/14.  Have a printed a lot?  Maybe 40 pages. It was all in grayscale and it still ran out as fast as the first one.

Reviewers sometimes give these units a lower rating because HP forces you to buy them and the units do not hold tons of ink, but that seems unfair to the cartridge.

Get The HP 901XL Instead...,"Having purchased an HP 4500 officejet a while back I also picked up some ink for it. 901 color and 2 - 901 black  cartridges(family does a lot of B&W printing)  I am not impressed at all with the 901 black.  It is substandard at best and produces very  mixed results.

Usually we print stuff on FAST (economy) and while the cartridge is rated for 200 pages, we actually got around 250-300 on the first one which puts it at around 125-150 for Normal.  (Usually fast/economy uses half the ink as it only does a single pass instead of two or three)  The strange part is.. the second cartridge we got was terrible performance.  I estimate by around 150 Fast/Economy the cartridge was starting to show it was almost out of ink already which would put it at around 75-100 pages normal!?

I was a bit shocked because there was such a deviation.  I did some research and found out that HP rates their Cartridges using an ISO standard Text document. They test on a J4580 printer which is an INK SAVER printer. If you do not own a J4580 then obviously you will get different results.

Because it is rated on a Text document keep in mind, print out a page that is loaded with black bars(like a bar graph) it will devour your ink; yet print out a page that has only a small amount of text you could go for 300+ pages easily.  I rarely complain about ink cartridges but I must say HP really should put some more ink into the standard 901 black; considering a 901XL has over 3x the rating (200 vs 700). Plus they should rate them using a ""Standard"" printer not an Ink Saver printer.  VERY MISLEADING !!

OVERALL
Avoid the 901 black!!  While they perform just fine and do have black ink in it that works, the cartridges performance is determined by how much black you print per page not by # of pages.  I would recommend instead spending the extra money and getting the 901XL black which is rated for 700 pages.  Once I got one of those I found I was able to print an entire ream of paper (500 pages) and the cartridge was still 50% full (all on economy/fast)  So despite paying twice the price I already DOUBLED my output compared to a 901 standard

In short.. avoid!!  get the 901XL as it will pay for itself.",06-14-2011

I have come out of the light of blank paper, and into the dark of true black ink. I have experienced an epiphany, a true realization of the meaning of life. Either that, or the crack I just smoked has finally kicked in.

Actually, what you want to do is buy these so you can use the scanner since these all-in-one devices often won't work at all if there's no ink in them. What you can get with one of HP's all-in-one devices like a scanner/fax machine is a not-very expensive (under $100) sheet-feeder scanner with OCR software that can be used to move documents off paper and into your computer.

But if you want to do inexpensive printing, this is okay for people doing less than 30-50 pages a month, or just doing small jobs (like printing envelopes or small batches of business cards where you change the design). If you go above maybe 50 pages a month HP is the second worst-cost printing provider (only Lexmark is consistently more expensive than HP), Brother and Epson are much cheaper on a per-page basis.

You can find flatbed combined scanner/printer combos for around $40. I bought one of HP's all-in-one printers that use this because it had a sheet feeder and when I need to scan several consecutive documents I use it. I don't do a lot of print outs, I think the estimate of around 100 pages/black in this cartridge is about right. For everything above very small printing volumes (30-100 pages/month) you probably want something other than HP. If your printing costs are running less than about 30 pages a month who cares, this will probably do fine and you'll get about 3 months out of it for ten bucks.",04-16-2011

It was only a little over a hundred dollars, so I knew ink would be expensive, especially from using previous HP models.  I don't use it a great deal, but after about 200 pages, it ran out of black ink. The color ink lasted a little longer, but that's because I usually write letters without much color.  Actually, that doesn't bother me, although I have read that most printers will have ink that lasts longer.  The secret to this ink from HP is to buy through Amazon from `used' or `refurbished' sellers.  You can save nearly 50% on costs and some give you free shipping.  That's what I ended up doing.  It looks exactly like a brand new cartridge.  I would recommend that if you want quality color photographs, you will need to buy a high quality (and more expensive) printer.

I had a Fellowes SB-97c for years about 11 years now, and never had any issues.  I needed another 20 sheet shredder for another office, so I bought the 99Ci.  It is really great.  While the specs call out 18 sheets, I took 20 pages of 8 1/2x11, and it gobbled it up without slowing down!

The top function buttons are obvious.  There is a power switch in the back near the power cord, flip that, then push the top round button, and it's ready to eat paper.  This new model has a run forward function, as well as run backwards.  Run forward is great since you do not have to wait for the shredder to start up every time to put paper in.  It's supposed to be use to oil, but you can run it on forward and shred away.  If you are going to shred a bunch, this takes a few seconds off the task.  The jamproof feature is nothing more than a load indicator...too many sheets, and it goes from green to red.

Casters are OK, drawer is really cheap.  It is made of the plastic cardboard that the post office bins are made off.  Had to knock a star off of the cheeeeeep drawer.  Motor seems quiet, I did not intentionally try to jam it.  Has auto sense/stop in case a small finger gets into the opening.

As with my older Fellowes unit, this one also leaves behind a mess when you pull the drawer.  Lots of shredded paper falls from the cutter, and finds its way to the back of the shredder, under the drawer.  Eventually the vacuum has to come out and clean all the paper that fell as you pull the drawer.  Just the way it is with a drawer shredder.",03-13-2018

What I don't like is that for some reason my bin keeps sliding out of place so it stops operating until it is completely in place, but this problem could be caused by the sample bags they give you and I will have to monkey around with that.  The other thing is that with the feeder not being in the center of the machine, the paper piles up giving you the error that the bin is too full  when it isn't.

(But so far so good)

I have a six-year-old Fellowes SB89Ci which was working perfectly in my very busy home office UNTIL somebody (family) put an envelope through it containing coins, and then used the forward/back buttons to 'clear the jam', ultimately breaking several of the plastic ""sweepers"" (those white plastic things which among other things separate the blades in the cutter head and also clear paper shards as they try to wrap themselves around the cutter head).  As a result, the cutter head now jams frequently and needs serious repair (it still shreds fine - except for a 5-inch gap in the middle).  I contacted Fellowes and the model is no longer made AND there are no repair parts available. (Sigh)  I did find two different shops who said they could probably repair it, but using one of them would cost me shipping in both directions PLUS the cost of the repair.  And the sum of those exceeds the cost of this shredder.

I was EXTREMELY happy with my old shredder and after looking at about a dozen others I ""settled on"" this one without hesitation.  Of course before actually ordering it I read a huge number of reviews of this shredder, and as I prefer to ""see it before I buy it"" I visited several local office supply stores.  However, as it turned out none of them had one in stock to examine, and consequently I ordered this one without my usual pre-purchase inspection.  (OK, so I'm extremely careful about anything like this which I buy with the intention of using for several  years...)

But after I had ordered it I continued reading even more reviews (here and on many sites) and there was one thing in particular which worried me.  Multiple reviewers complained about the collection basket, and at least two of them claimed that it was made out of cardboard. (Fortunately those two were incorrect.)

So as soon as it arrived, I opened the box (which showed no damage) and on inspection I decided that the box must have received some rough handling from the USPS who delivered it.  The reason behind my decision was that the head had somehow detached from the body of the shredder.  However (and fortunately) after a quick inspection there was no obvious damage, and the two pieces snapped back together just fine.

Then I examined the collection bin and had to laugh.  It is made of the same corrugated plastic as the mail tubs used at my office (and the USPS, too IIRC - albeit without their steel rod frame), and it is of a somewhat lighter gauge.  But with normal use it should work well in its intended purpose.  Also it is a MAJOR improvement over that in my old 89Ci which had a number of sharp protrusions which often caught and tore the collection bags when I tried to remove them.  This one does NOT have anything protruding into the collection bin and bags should not catch (or tear) on it.

(On the subject of collection bags, where I live shredded papers which are NOT in transparent bags are frequently not picked up by the recycling truck on ""trash day"" and I have been using clear, (unbranded) 13-gallon drawstring garbage bags which are a little ""over-sized"" for this shredder (or my old 89Ci) but which work just fine and cost about $0.125 each in quantity. Amazon has several similar to them - search for ""clear drawstring 13-gallon trash bags."")

I will be going over it VERY carefully in the next day or so just to make sure that there was no other problem from its being jarred in shipping (and if there is any, I will be doing an exchange to get another).  But so far it looks good, and I have already shredded a pile of office papers and accounting records over a foot high, and at this point the 99Ci is so much better than my old shredder that I am EXTREMELY happy with it.

So far the shredder behaves exactly as it's supposed to and I'm a happy camper.  My only minor complaint is that the paper is just a littler harder to get into the slot than it was on my old 89Ci as this one is ""thinner"" (same width though).  But then, had the slot on my old shredder been like the one on this 99Ci, nobody would have been able to put an envelope containing several coins into the shredder, so maybe this is a worthwhile improvement.

Based on my previous experience with the 89Ci (and a couple of other Fellowes shredders at my office) and my initial experience with this one, I would not hesitate to recommend it to family, friends, and co-workers.

(REMINDER:  MY CAVEAT STILL STANDS THAT I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS WHEN I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO USE IT EXTENSIVELY.  But until then, I am very happy with this shredder.",09-30-2017

I have used it a few times myself and love it. The 14 year old shredder I had in my office was jamming and not cutting well, so I decided to get this for it the day that this went down around twenty bucks in price. I just got through setting it up and will do a little review.

It is very quiet. It is more quiet than my ductless A/C and Laser printer, but not as quiet as the dorm refrigerator if that gives you an idea of the volume. As far as the casters, I was able to put them in just using my hands and a little pressure (then again I am the Hulk ;-) ) Most went in the first time or two, but one took a little extra to push all of the way down. Whether that was the position it was (left side, furthest away) or a little difference in the slot or caster is beyond me. Still, it is nothing to complain about although I am sure even using a rubber mallet would be a little awkward.

At first I thought that they measured it wrong, because of the shape of it etc. but it does barely fit under my desk (which at its lowest point) is not quite 26 inches off from the bottom of the drawer to the floor. This is taller and not as wide. One strange thing though is the slot to fit the paper is from front to back instead of side to side (due to how narrow this is.) I suppose you could flit it around, but it would be awkward. As it is, I have to pull this out from under the desk for use (but I don't shred even every week, so it is a hassle I will put up with as my space in here is limited, and I don't have another good place for it. My old shredder didn't have casters, so I guess I could have not put them on, but his thing is pretty hefty and I like the convenience of having it on wheels.

One way I thought was a little cheap is that the majority of the bucket seems to be made from corrugated plastic instead of tougher plastic. At least it reminds me of my corrugated plastic LP boxes. This does make it a bit lighter and yes, I suppose it would be fairly easy to unscrew the tougher plastic that attaches to it and replace (presuming one could get a replacement). Still, I expected a bit more in that department.",07-16-2017

It's a medium size so not intimidating to have in your home office or at your work desk. Relatively quiet mostly because it isn't as shrill as some of the smaller units can be.

It will stop as soon as it senses it might be too much. You can press a button to keep going but on several occasionswhen I did, the motor bogged and it would not reverse back out. At this point, the page is too far in and too short for me to grab by hand to yank out. I don't know why it won't reverse out. Maybe the mechanical switch was no longer depressed. I had to grab a small needle nose and pick it out to free it up. The only solution to prevent this is to feed the thicker end first or upside down. I have to remind myself of this.

When running, the bin door would not stay shut but popped open from the shuddering of the machine.

Back about 11 years ago the C80 was the equivalent of this device for the time. We had exceptional luck with it with many thousands of shreds.

A few improvements over this are evident compared to the older models.

1) This has a 'detection' for hands/fingers being stuck in it. Even a small baby or child can't get this to harm them as the sensor seems to detect HEAT. I can't verify the heat aspect but it really does seem to detect 'living' matter and turn itself off.
2) Auto-Turn on.. Turn it on, shred and walk away and within about 5 minutes this will turn off.. GREAT feature!
3) Much quieter basket. The basket is a honeycomb material that buffers sound very nicely compared to the older plastic ones.
4) Auto-Reshred.. Older ones jammed and had to be reversed, this one does it for you automatically. Very handy and you don't play the back and forth game with thick piles of paper.
5) Thickness meter. A nice feature is this will tell you at the outset if you are attempting to shred piles that are too large. The meter will spike up to red to show you the load is too high.

We use this in the home because we found cheap shredders to be annoying, loud and unreliable. It's well worth spending the money on higher end shredders like this because they can last a decade or more and provide much more reliable service. Strongly recommended!",12-08-2016

They usually last 2-3 years with moderate use.  However, when I recently purchased this same model to replace the one that just died, I was unable to get the paper bin to close properly and had to return it before even being able to use it. Upon inspection, I saw that they have changed the design of the paper bin so that instead of being solid molded plastic it is now a flexible vinyl with plastic rivets holding the folded vinyl pieces together.  So the whole bin is very flexible and therefore does not make a solid closing.  A sensor in the machine requires the bin to be securely closed for the machine to work. The previous molded plastic bin was not great and often required several tries to close it securely, but this new version is very poorly designed and manufactured.  I also notice that the price is $30 less than it was 3 years ago so perhaps that is reflected in the reduced quality.",11-02-2016

Man, this shredder.

For years I have used a Fellowes P-8C. Running a small home business, I have documents to shred - maybe 5-10 pages per day, but not a huge workload. The problem is, I'm lazy. So I'll toss papers in a box, and when I have accumulated hundreds of things, I'll sit down and I'll shred them all. Now, the aforementioned P-8C is a fine shredder, and if you shred your documents daily, or even once a week, it will serve you well. But if you do what I do, you want the 99Ci. This thing is huge. It has a 9 gallon paper capacity (50% more, on paper, than the P-8C, but it feels like much more than that) and the bin pulls completely out, for easy disposal. No longer will you need to pop the top off your shredder and awkwardly place it on the ground/a table, while remnants of paper shredding go flying everywhere.

The 99Ci takes a considerable stack of paper per pass, and even has a gauge on the top to tell you how efficiently you're using the machine: from 1-2 bars ""eh, that's not enough!"" to 5-6 bars, ""oh man, slow it down a bit"" to the 3-4 bars, indicating optimal efficiency. If you put too much product in for it to shred, it flat-out won't accept that pass until you remove some sheets, so while most shredders usually say they're ""jam proof,"" you literally will need to find a way to trick the 99Ci because it simply won't let you insert too much paper for it to handle.

If you take my ""shred your documents every few months, when there's a huge box of stuff to shred"" approach, this shredder - or one of a similar caliber - will be well worth your month. It's so good, you'll likely find yourself slightly bummed out when you run out of paper to feed through it.",09-12-2016

You may ask yourself, is paper dust a real thing? yes, yes it is.

So, I had a lot of ""documents"" such as old bills and what not, stuff that had account
info on it and such, that I felt would be better to shred for security reasons. I
then pondered if I could use the shredding's with soil for worm bedding? I still
don't know the answer to that.

I wanted something that was going to be reasonably quiet for what it was doing, and
robust, or well built. And the knee jerk reaction of reading fellow verified reviews led me here
to this paper shredder for home use.

So, quick bullet points

+I thought it was too big for home use, then after five minutes the 9 Gallon bin was filled up, and I had to push the stuff down, rinse wash and repeat. Not a big issue.

+The bin is made of plastic corrugated cardboard like material. It surprised me, but I guess it may end up being stronger and lighter than going with plastic. If I want to get hardcore about it, I could always make a bin myself out of sheet metal and rivets. Time will tell on what gives out first. The shredder head, or the bin.

+Quiet. I actually expected it to be louder, but it just quietly nibbles away at the paper

+It's quicker than I thought it would be. Like I expected to be waiting on the shredder, instead it was waiting on me.

+Packaging It's pretty well packed. Corner guards in the box, along with a top and bottom thick formed cardboard covers.
-Instructions are straight forward, like 3 pages. You get three languages. English is easy mode. And then you got Spanish and French.
-You get a small container of ""lubricant"" with the shredder.
-You get bags with the shredder.

+Plug and Play, basically this thing is ready to go right out of the box. Caster wheels just plug right into the housing on the bottom.

Of course part of this feature is that the motor stops when a too-thick bundle of paper is detected in the slot.  While this can be frustrating, it's much better than a jam.  If the material bogs down the shredder after it's already started shedding, the motor stops, reverses, then powers though in forward again.  I've had no problems shedding CDs or credit cards.

That said, I have two complaints.  Complaint #1: shredded material piles up in the bin without spreading out, causing the bin-full sensor to trip prematurely.  This is easily dealt with by pulling the bin out slightly and shaking it, but out it shouldn't be necessary.  I blame the deep, narrow bin design for this.  Complaint #2: the paper feed slot opening is poorly signed, making it more difficult than necessary to get (paper stacks with) dog-eared pages into the slot.

The bin is set up in a herky jerky way, and it's very cheap in your hand.  When you pull it out if it's a bit over full from the last
shredding, you'll probably have overflow bits inside the reservoir basin.  But it's not a clean hollow, rectangular area, so you can't really
get it picked up with ease.  The bin feels like it wants to fold over in your hand, not solid at all.  I read that in other reviews though, and
bought it anyway.

The power button on my first Fellowes shredder stopped working after only a couple or years, and I trashed it since it was out of warranty. The power button on this shredder now requires me to push it three or four times to turn the unit on or off. My last Fellowes did exactly the same thing before it stopped working altogether. It seems unreasonable that a product costing this much money cannot last more than two years before malfunctioning. When this unit stops working, (as I expect it to soon), I will look at other options. Hopefully there will be better options.

***UPDATE*** Fellowes responded to my post and although my shredder was out of warranty I told them the problems started well before warranty expiration. They agreed to send me a replacement power button, which I installed and the shredder is working perfectly again. But since the power buttons on both shredders failed within a couple to three years, if the power button fails again, I would look at another brand.

I can live with it, but I'm not thrilled with it, for the following reasons:

1.  It's SLOW!  I thought this was going to be great for shredding stacks of old documents I no longer need, but it would take so long with this shredder that I'll probably have to use a professional service.

2.  Unlike the videos of this model on the manufacturer's website, that show someone just dropping in a document as they walk by, this shredder does not ""grab"" the paper and send it on its way.  Instead, you have to push the paper down into the shredder before it takes it and slowwwly feeds it through.  This really slows things down.  My cheap old shredder (which is no longer made) grabbed the document immediately; it was really fast.

3.  The drawer that holds the paper shreds is really clunky to pull in and out.  It doesn't have any rails to ride smoothly like a real drawer.  Instead, you have to jostle it in and out, and sometimes it takes a fair amount of jostling to get it back in place.  The drawer also doesn't have any way to secure a plastic bag to hold the shreds.  The drawer isn't designed like a waste bin, where you can just pull the edges of a plastic bag over the edges of the bin.  Instead, one end of the drawer is also the exterior handle used to pull it out.

4.  It doesn't take nearly as much paper as I was expecting it to.  It has a row of lights that indicate whether you putting in too much paper for it to handle.  It doesn't take much for it to indicate that it's too much.  Around five to six sheets is the very most it can handle before protesting.

5.  Yes, like others, I did have to call the manufacturer to find out that the castors have to be hammered into place.  You'd think they could mention that in the instructions.  And they're not all that easy to hammer, given that they're spinning around madly while you're hammering them.

In all, having used it for a couple of weeks and having already discarded the packaging, I guess I'm stuck with it.  But I wouldn't buy it again.",04-28-2015

FASTER than others and well built!,"I like to do a lot of researching for machines I use frequently around the house. I always want the best performing and top quality product and I don't mind spending a little more money to find it. I saw a video review of this compared to other same level shredders (I youtube everything before I buy).

Fast forward - it's FAST compared to others in its class. It's SOLID. It's MOBILE (somewhat). And it's ""SMART"" though I don't know if that's a necessity (jam light detector).

It is on the larger side, but the plug in the back bends downward so you can push it up against the wall more so than other machines - that's a smart idea. Simple things like that prove to me I made the right purchase.

I like that there are two power switches - one in the back (main power) and one in the front on the top. The one on the top is like an on demand button (not a switch). The small round button is flanked by the manual forward/reverse buttons. Use the on demand power button to keep the power on all the time or turn it off when not in use, I choose the latter. By default, the shredder won't run unless there's something in the chute OR if you manually press the forward/reverse button.

The basket is removable and the entire unit glides around on casters. The casters don't lock, but they don't roll around aimlessly. You can choose not to install the casters. When installing the casters use a bit of extra force until they ""pop/click"" into the slot.

The only downside to the shredder that I could see possibly, is that the front power button is a very bright blue light inside of it and it catches your eye's attention. Something like this in an office setting might be an annoyance, so you could probably just put a small piece of electrical tape over it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed that the blue light goes off after a couple of minutes, so the unit looks completely off but will shred on demand when something is placed in the slot. Now I'm even happier than before! ]]

Just got this 99Ci to replace a 15 year old low grade/snail speed over a waste basket shredder. Have a lot of paper to shred and a local shredding company wants 10 moola for each shopping bag full, I figured I'll shred myself and get something out of it in the end.

I was debating between this model and the AmazonBasics 24-Sheet Cross-Cut, finally decided on this, mainly due to the 100% Jam Proof, SafeSense, 10 FPM speed (no speed info on the AmazonBasics) and the larger 9 gallon bin features, plus it just looks more well built with better features that the AmazonBasics.

Pros
- Well built, feels solid for its price range.
- The casters were easy to install by myself (this is a man's job)
- Instructions were clear and easy to understand (this is also a man's job)
- The bin slides in and out easily.
- The capacity indicator is pretty cool, handy if trying to insert too many pages, which prevents jamming.
- The SafeSense feature, good for safety, plus if you keep your hand on there for more than 3 seconds, the machine actually turns off completely.
- First tested with 20 pages of 20lb copy paper, it was too thick and the capacity indicator was in the red, shredding would not even start, until I got down to 18 pages, then shredding went through without any problems.
- My first real batch of shredding completely filled a 12""x12""x8"" box, lots of old invoices and statements, took about 25-30 minutes, almost ran it continuously. The shredder finally overloaded right when I finished, went into cool down mode, but I noticed that the overload red light went off about 15-20 minutes later, but the motor felt pretty warm still. I have many more of those boxes of paper to go.
- Within the 25-30 minutes of shredding, only one jam due to too many pages, hit the reverse button to back it out a little, then forward button to finish shredding it.
- When shredding lots of pages, you can tell that the sound of the motor is stressing, but just a little though, still pretty quiet and will shred the 18 pages quickly, does not really slow down much at all.
- 10 feet per minute seems pretty fast for this level of shredder, compared to my old snail shredder.
- Junk mail: I luv it that I can just throw the average junk mail (unopened) right into the shredder.
- Did try to insert stacks of paper in crooked, so that it'd fold during shredding, but it never got jammed once.

Minor Cons
- Even with a 9 gallon bin, because the shredded paper is pretty fluffed, it gets full pretty quick, even though the paper gets distributed in the bin pretty evenly by itself. Within the 25-30 minutes, I filled two bins and had to pad down the paper around 4 times per bin and oiled the blade at least twice per bin. If you are using a bag to hold the paper and you pad down the paper as much as possible, when you pull the bag out, the inside part of the bin window have cornered edges, which will rip the bag, but of course this will most likely not happen if you do not pad down the paper.
- You have to insert the paper about 2-3 inches into the slot before it'll start shredding, but you'll get used to it quickly.

Miscellaneous
- Instructions state that it should be turned off when done shredding, not a big deal with a simple push of the on/off button.
- Since the bin gets filled pretty quick and you are supposed to oil the blade with every emptying of the bin, make sure you get yourself a nice big bottle of shredder oil, or vegetable oil (non aerosol) and get an applicator with a long nozzle.
- This model does have the Energy Savings Feature, it's not stated on Amazon, but it's on the manufacturer's site.

Conclusion
- As long as it last for years to come, am very happy with the purchase. I believe I read about a plastic gear that was used in the previous model SB-99Ci, hopefully the issue with that is now fixed with this current model.
- Now that I have a much better shredder, shredding is ""ALMOST"" fun.

BTW: I'm just kidding with the being a man's job comments, I believe in complete equality. You go girl!

>> UPDATE 1/21/2015
Just out of curiosity, I just had to find some DVDs to shred, which I found about 10, threw each one into the shredder, one after another, no problems at all, it was actually fun and enjoyable, at least this first time.

I was also curious about the shredding oil, so I called Fellowes to get more info, here is what it comes down to:
- Any vegetable oil will work.
- Typically, one found at super markets will have a smell to it and one found at office stores will not. The ones with the smell is for cooking, the only difference is that it has a smell, but both work the same. I prefer no smell, so I guess I'll have to pay a little more for that one.
- The manual suggest that every time the bin indicator lights up that it's full(without padding down the shredded material), you should squirt some shredding oil on the blades. But, if you want to pad down the shredded material every so long, to prolong when it is actually completely full, so that when the bin is finally truly full even by padding down the shredded material, you can then squirt some shredding oil on the blades, so that you do not have to oil it as often.

I luv this shredder, so far.",01-14-2015

It is pricey, but if you paid a shredding company to do it - it is more expensive.

Here's what's in the box. It comes in Amazon frustration free packaging - You get the shredder, oil to lubricate the cutting surface, and bags. It was easy to assemble and pleasure to use. I may buy one for my office.

The machine is a little larger than my mental calculations sized up the dimensions, but that's my error...it's the size that is written about.

It's a quiet machine...not whisper quiet, but quiet (I use it at home...and it doesn't wake up my newborn).  It shreds a healthy stack of papers in no time at all.  I have yet to have it over heat, which is great because the fact that it's supposed to run up to 25 minutes before needing to cool down was key for me given the large amount of old paperwork that I needed to shred...my old 8 sheet shredder shuts down after 5 minutes.

The safety feature truly works...it senses my fingers/hand and shuts down the shredder until a split second after I remove my hand.

It comes with 4-5 plastic bags to start you off in the huge bin that it comes with.  It also comes with a tiny (VERY TINY) amount of oil for lubricating the blades when needed.

I really would like a micro-cut but this cross cut is fine.  I cannot imagine any thief trying to sort through a 9-gallon bag of cross -cut paper shreds.  Yeah could happen, but most likely safe....especially given the fact that there are numerous other people who don't shred and some thief will find it easier to sort through their un-shredded stuff vs piecing together 9-gallons of reasonably fine cross shredding!

The receptacle that receives the shredded paper is about 2/3rds the size of the total machine and holds plenty of waste.
This is a beast, but like anything else, needs some love and care.  GET THE OIL for lubrication treatment and this will last you a very long time.

PROS:
- can feed whole envelopes into it with rarely an issue.
- shreds for a long time before needing to cool down
- cross shredding
- Indicator for how thick of a feed you are reaching before hitting the limit
- we like to shred everything, and this shreds everything.
- large bin.  When it is full, pack it down and keep going.
- can use trashbags as a liner in the removable bin.
- when something is too large and may jam it, it will stop briefly, and auto-reverse, then try again.

CONS:
- it's large.  you'll need a place to store this where it's still convenient to pull out and use when required.
- when ""full"" stops the machine, there's often lots of dangly bits hanging from the shredding mechanism still and can sometimes cling onto it until after you've pulled the bin all the way out.  you will have to open slightly and knock it loose so it falls in the bin to avoid a big mess when pulling the bin out completely.",11-02-2014

After a year and some oiling here and there, it's been fantastic. This machine has probably shredded 100,000 pages by now and uncountable CD's, credit cards, and so on. The only, and I mean ONLY complaint I have is the paper sensor always thinks you have too much in (for example, seven 22lb sheets and it won't auto-feed them in) so you have to manually press the feed button. I usually just leave the feed running non-stop while I shred to get around this. But in reality, the motor is capable of shredding at least 10 22lb sheets at a time before it sounds like its struggling.

To clear the jam you must reach underneath the cutters and remove the clumped up partially cut papers. You cannot clear the jam any other way. Moreover, the shredder does an extremely poor job shredding glossy paper and basically runs it through the cutters without shredding it completely. If you do buy this shredder, which is not recommended, you should buy several bottles of Fellowes shredder oil because you will need them. The oil helps a little but not much.

I kept taking extreme measures to have my older unit stay alive, but eventually, it would over heat with just one sheet paper.  In comes the new Fellows PowerShred 99Ci.

I read all of the reviews, and decided that a few extra dollars for the more powerful unit would be the wiser investment.  I am happy with my decision.

Here are the things that impress me:
1 - It is extremely quiet
2 - It has the power to shred 10+ thick stock paper
3 - It can continuously for almost 30 minutes before the over-heat function kicked in.
4 - It has an ""bin full shut-off"" indicator, that is a great safety feature
5 - It senses when fingers are near the shredder, and stops shredding.
6 - It has a large trash capacity, making it less of a hassle to empty it
7 - Compact design fits nicely in my office
8 - Decent looking, for a paper shredder.
9 - LED indicator tells me when I can feed it more (or less) paper based on the grade of the paper.

It really does gobble gobs of paper, and if you stuff too much into the shredder slot, it will slow down, sometimes back up the paper, then take it down again. It corrects its own jams too. The two things that can still cause a jam: shredded paper will pile up in the shredder bin like a mini-mountain of shredder discards piled high. When the mini-mountain gets too high, the outfeed from the shredder is blocked, and the shredder will jam. You need to pull the bin out, push down the loose-shredded material, then shove the bin in again, and the shredder will start up by itself.  It is recommended you buy shredder oil; the shredder shreds so much paper, those shredder teeth need more lube--and it has to be shredder lube. Our shredder can run continuously for about 25 minutes before it overheats.  Then it will stop and cool automatically.  We're happy with our decision to get this one.",03-18-2014

With my old shredder, I forgot to read the instructions and
did not service the shredder by applying vegetable oil to the cutters after each drawer fill up, so the old one broke down after a couple of years. The drawer size of 9 gallons takes my 13 gallon biodegradable bag nicely. You can stretch the bag over the back of the drawer, and the front has two protruding notches for the bag. I had lots of paper to shred, and completed 9 bags filled over a few days. Machine works well although none are extremely quiet.
The specs. say you can shred 17 sheets. I prefer keeping the number of sheets in the green light. I found the following:
17 sheets = red light.  14-16 sheets = Orange 2 light.  11-13 sheets = Orange 1 light.  9-10 sheets = green 5 light.
  8 sheets = green 4 light.  4-7  sheets = green 3  light.  3 sheets = green 2 light.  2 sheets = green 1 light.

Must use vegetable oil on the cutter after filling each bag. You can buy shredder oil or I assume use any clear vegetable oil.

Dislikes: Very minor issues. The castor wheels really need to be pounded into place.  I used clear shipping tape to smooth the edges inside the drawer around the viewing port. This keeps the bag from tearing when full.  The cut paper tends to bunch up directly under the cutter which trips the ""full' red light. You may have to open the drawer and pat down the paper three or four times before bag is full.  The small bottle of oil supplied is pretty small and you will have to make a stopper for it. Fellowes make a 12 oz. bottle with an extension nozzle that is too large. This really wastes the oil. I found a travel bottle with flip up nozzle that works well (try Target).",12-25-2013

UPDATE, 2015/09/24: I had originally given this shredder five stars, and if I were only rating the mechanical parts of it, I would give it five stars still. The shredder and all of its features still work extremely well after two years.

The only problem has been with the design of the cabinet. The rounded corners at the bottom front seem not to have enough material to support the weight of the shredder itself.

Then about three months later the plastic around the front right caster collapsed in very much the same way (even the cracks were in the same places). Again, I repaired it successfully with J-B Plastic Weld Putty. If I were rating this shredder based on this only, I would probably have to give it one star. Although making the repairs was of little import to me, the fact that I had to speaks volumes.

I started a business and now have a lot more to shred, so spent the extra bucks.  I'm wondering why I didn't do it sooner.  No more opening all the aggravating junk mail.  I run it through without ever opening it.  Description says it can't be jammed.  I wondered how they could claim this.  There is a sensor that will shut the shredder down if the paper stack you are trying to shred is too thick.  So in essence it doesn't try to take on more than it can handle.  I've done my best to test it.  I have managed to make it stop and reverse the shred a couple times.  It still didn't jam, just backed up and made me lighten the load before trying to run it through again.  It is a bit bigger than I am used to, but I'm learning to like this as well, less emptying.",04-19-2013

I researched available models and decided on the Fellows 99Ci.  The Fellows 125Ci is almost double the price and I thought was probably overkill for my needs.
Amazon shipping was stellar as usual. UPS delivery to my front door.
Shredder technology has come a long way in 10 years.  This model is very quiet  and in comparison to my old one that you had to almost wear ear protection when using. You could talk on the phone and shred at the same with the Fellows shredder with barely any notice.  Jam free technology automatically clears any paper jams. Safety features look improved also to protect against finger intrusion (not that I plan on testing this feature)  It says you can put in up to 17 pages at a time but this is only for very thin paper.  Standard weight copy paper is closer to 7-8 pages.  Indicator lights glow green-yellow-red to let you know if you are putting too much in.  The bin is decent capacity for home use. The way the paper falls into the bin will turn on the ""bin full"" light a little prematurely as it mounds up. Just pull out the basket and redistribute the shredded paper in the basket  to get more capacity.  Fellows recommends using the supplied oil after each bag change.  The bottle of oil looks like it should last 5 years.  The machine looks very robust and well made.  Maximum continuous run time is 25 minutes which is a whole lot of shredding if you needed to get rid of a box of documents quickly (like get out of the embassy quick).  If you need to shred bank or credit card statements, confidential documents, etc. the 99Ci looks perfect for the job.  Cross cutting gives you peace of mind about putting the shredded pieces out for trash or recycling that nobody will read your confidential information.",03-12-2013

First one was one of those that you fit over a standard garbage (that jammed easily). Then I upgraded to one that could handle up to 12 sheets, but after 7 plus years of use a part broke where it runs all the time unless unplugged and that got old so I went back on the hunt for a new one. After a lot of back and forth I decided on this one and I do not regret it at all. It is...
1. Powerful.
2. Cuts the paper in small particles instead of long strips.
3. Quiet, extremely quiet. In fact, it's so quiet that I now can shred stuff while people are on the phone or/and watching TV and it's no bother.
4. Durable.

I haven't had it long but I am quite pleased with this purchase. Great find!

As far as the sensor, as you play with it you figure out ways past it. I have had it tell me things were too thick to shred and I would just press and hold the forward button and it shredded it just fine. These things so far seem to be built to shred, but I doubt last. I believe if I continue to do that I will eventually break it so I need to be careful on that for things are just not built like they used to be. However, if you follow what the sensor tells you, then I am sure it will last a good 5 plus years. Also, that sensor where it detects if your finger is touching it while is shredding actually works. Sometimes can get annoying but it serves a useful purpose so for that reason I can look past that.",01-15-2013

In the past couple of years, our business has grown; and, due to the number of federal documents with personal information that we handle, we do a lot of shredding. :)

Anyway, when I went out to buy a new shredder, it didn't even dawn on me that I would be able to find an affordable unit with the performance of this Fellowes shredder!

Here are the things we like about it:

- There are definitely limits to what it can shred at one time - but it does such a great job monitoring itself that it doesn't seem possible to jam it.

- The output bin is large enough to be truly useful, and is also easy to empty.  The shredded paper will kind of stack up in the middle - so we generally have to open it up and spread the paper bits around about once for every time we fill the bin up.  That's not a big deal at all considering we can fit 3 to 4 times the amount of shredded paper that our old unit held.

- It is quiet.  This was definitely an unexpected & pleasant surprise.  It is definitely not silent; but, it just emits a deep hum instead of the high pitched sound our old unit had.

- It looks good and is easily maneuverable thanks to the caster wheels.

- I love the safety feature where it will turn off if you touch the shredder input.  I've tested it and it works great.

- I know most paper shredders have a front window; but, that is also a nice feature.

- The shredding is very effective and results in nice small pieces.

The only downside I can even remotely think of is that the blades require occasional oiling; but, I deal with a lot of equipment and think that is pretty normal for a high-performance machine like this one.  I do wish, however, that the instructions had more info on how much oil is optimal - or how often we should oil the blades.

Overall, if you're looking for a high-performance shredder that won't break the bank, then I highly recommend this unit!  It probably sounds dumb to get excited about a paper shredder - but the performance of this PowerShred has absolutely blown me away!",12-13-2012

Then, it hit me that there might be a reset button on it.  Sure enough on the back of the shredder there is a power switch.  Apparently, a power surge had knocked out my power.  I  flipped that little switch and it was perfect again.  So, of course, I cancelled my return.  It says it will take 17 pages.  That's a bit of a stretch.  If you want to clog your machine, you can try 17 pages; however, about half that many will work better.  I have had my beast for three months now, and have done some pretty heavy-duty shredding--shredding a bunch of old income tax returns, etc., and she is humming right along.

However, I'm not happy with this product.  The problems I encountered with the use of this shredder are as follow:  The 99Ci does not shred junk mail, i.e., unopened envelopes that contain more than 3 or 4 sheets of paper.  The machine is too sensitive in that it stops shredding when the paper bin is only half full, requiring frequent emptying of the bucket, which is a nuisance.  The 99Ci is advertised as having the capability to shred up to 17 sheets of paper at a time, but in my experience, sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't; and when it does, it struggles to get the job done.  I haven't had a chance to test the machine's cool-down period that would be required after 25 minutes of continuous use, and therefore cannot provide any useful comment about that particular function.  In a nutshell, the 99Ci that I received and have used does not justify its high price.

I had a Fellowes SB-97c for years about 11 years now, and never had any issues.  I needed another 20 sheet shredder for another office, so I bought the 99Ci.  It is really great.  While the specs call out 18 sheets, I took 20 pages of 8 1/2x11, and it gobbled it up without slowing down!

The top function buttons are obvious.  There is a power switch in the back near the power cord, flip that, then push the top round button, and it's ready to eat paper.  This new model has a run forward function, as well as run backwards.  Run forward is great since you do not have to wait for the shredder to start up every time to put paper in.  It's supposed to be use to oil, but you can run it on forward and shred away.  If you are going to shred a bunch, this takes a few seconds off the task.  The jamproof feature is nothing more than a load indicator...too many sheets, and it goes from green to red.

Casters are OK, drawer is really cheap.  It is made of the plastic cardboard that the post office bins are made off.  Had to knock a star off of the cheeeeeep drawer.  Motor seems quiet, I did not intentionally try to jam it.  Has auto sense/stop in case a small finger gets into the opening.

As with my older Fellowes unit, this one also leaves behind a mess when you pull the drawer.  Lots of shredded paper falls from the cutter, and finds its way to the back of the shredder, under the drawer.  Eventually the vacuum has to come out and clean all the paper that fell as you pull the drawer.  Just the way it is with a drawer shredder.",03-13-2018

It truly is heavy duty and can shred silently many sheets of paper at a time and it is nice being able to put entire envelopes of junk mail into it which is a time saver. I like the warning indicator lights that show you can increase the pages in the feed or when you have too many.  What I don't like is that for some reason my bin keeps sliding out of place so it stops operating until it is completely in place, but this problem could be caused by the sample bags they give you and I will have to monkey around with that.  The other thing is that with the feeder not being in the center of the machine, the paper piles up giving you the error that the bin is too full  when it isn't.  I wind up opening the bin and shuffle the shredded paper evenly so I can make a full load.  It is an improvement over my last shredder which was noisy, but in reality even though it was smaller, I think it held more shredded paper before I would have to replace the bag.",10-07-2017

(But so far so good)

I have a six-year-old Fellowes SB89Ci which was working perfectly in my very busy home office UNTIL somebody (family) put an envelope through it containing coins, and then used the forward/back buttons to 'clear the jam', ultimately breaking several of the plastic ""sweepers"" (those white plastic things which among other things separate the blades in the cutter head and also clear paper shards as they try to wrap themselves around the cutter head).  As a result, the cutter head now jams frequently and needs serious repair (it still shreds fine - except for a 5-inch gap in the middle).  I contacted Fellowes and the model is no longer made AND there are no repair parts available. (Sigh)  I did find two different shops who said they could probably repair it, but using one of them would cost me shipping in both directions PLUS the cost of the repair.  And the sum of those exceeds the cost of this shredder.

I was EXTREMELY happy with my old shredder and after looking at about a dozen others I ""settled on"" this one without hesitation.  Of course before actually ordering it I read a huge number of reviews of this shredder, and as I prefer to ""see it before I buy it"" I visited several local office supply stores.  However, as it turned out none of them had one in stock to examine, and consequently I ordered this one without my usual pre-purchase inspection.  (OK, so I'm extremely careful about anything like this which I buy with the intention of using for several  years...)

But after I had ordered it I continued reading even more reviews (here and on many sites) and there was one thing in particular which worried me.  Multiple reviewers complained about the collection basket, and at least two of them claimed that it was made out of cardboard. (Fortunately those two were incorrect.)

So as soon as it arrived, I opened the box (which showed no damage) and on inspection I decided that the box must have received some rough handling from the USPS who delivered it.  The reason behind my decision was that the head had somehow detached from the body of the shredder.  However (and fortunately) after a quick inspection there was no obvious damage, and the two pieces snapped back together just fine.

Then I examined the collection bin and had to laugh.  It is made of the same corrugated plastic as the mail tubs used at my office (and the USPS, too IIRC - albeit without their steel rod frame), and it is of a somewhat lighter gauge.  But with normal use it should work well in its intended purpose.  Also it is a MAJOR improvement over that in my old 89Ci which had a number of sharp protrusions which often caught and tore the collection bags when I tried to remove them.  This one does NOT have anything protruding into the collection bin and bags should not catch (or tear) on it.

(On the subject of collection bags, where I live shredded papers which are NOT in transparent bags are frequently not picked up by the recycling truck on ""trash day"" and I have been using clear, (unbranded) 13-gallon drawstring garbage bags which are a little ""over-sized"" for this shredder (or my old 89Ci) but which work just fine and cost about $0.125 each in quantity. Amazon has several similar to them - search for ""clear drawstring 13-gallon trash bags."")

I will be going over it VERY carefully in the next day or so just to make sure that there was no other problem from its being jarred in shipping (and if there is any, I will be doing an exchange to get another).  But so far it looks good, and I have already shredded a pile of office papers and accounting records over a foot high, and at this point the 99Ci is so much better than my old shredder that I am EXTREMELY happy with it.

So far the shredder behaves exactly as it's supposed to and I'm a happy camper.  My only minor complaint is that the paper is just a littler harder to get into the slot than it was on my old 89Ci as this one is ""thinner"" (same width though).  But then, had the slot on my old shredder been like the one on this 99Ci, nobody would have been able to put an envelope containing several coins into the shredder, so maybe this is a worthwhile improvement.

Based on my previous experience with the 89Ci (and a couple of other Fellowes shredders at my office) and my initial experience with this one, I would not hesitate to recommend it to family, friends, and co-workers.

(REMINDER:  MY CAVEAT STILL STANDS THAT I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS WHEN I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO USE IT EXTENSIVELY.  But until then, I am very happy with this shredder.",09-30-2017

I have used it a few times myself and love it. The 14 year old shredder I had in my office was jamming and not cutting well, so I decided to get this for it the day that this went down around twenty bucks in price. I just got through setting it up and will do a little review.

It is very quiet. It is more quiet than my ductless A/C and Laser printer, but not as quiet as the dorm refrigerator if that gives you an idea of the volume. As far as the casters, I was able to put them in just using my hands and a little pressure (then again I am the Hulk ;-) ) Most went in the first time or two, but one took a little extra to push all of the way down. Whether that was the position it was (left side, furthest away) or a little difference in the slot or caster is beyond me. Still, it is nothing to complain about although I am sure even using a rubber mallet would be a little awkward.

At first I thought that they measured it wrong, because of the shape of it etc. but it does barely fit under my desk (which at its lowest point) is not quite 26 inches off from the bottom of the drawer to the floor. This is taller and not as wide. One strange thing though is the slot to fit the paper is from front to back instead of side to side (due to how narrow this is.) I suppose you could flit it around, but it would be awkward. As it is, I have to pull this out from under the desk for use (but I don't shred even every week, so it is a hassle I will put up with as my space in here is limited, and I don't have another good place for it. My old shredder didn't have casters, so I guess I could have not put them on, but his thing is pretty hefty and I like the convenience of having it on wheels.

One way I thought was a little cheap is that the majority of the bucket seems to be made from corrugated plastic instead of tougher plastic. At least it reminds me of my corrugated plastic LP boxes. This does make it a bit lighter and yes, I suppose it would be fairly easy to unscrew the tougher plastic that attaches to it and replace (presuming one could get a replacement). Still, I expected a bit more in that department.",07-16-2017

When running, the bin door would not stay shut but popped open from the shuddering of the machine.  We tried it with the previous, high quality bin, which worked slightly better but still popped open.  The comparison with our previous model is stark.  That one is sturdy and reliable.  This one cannot be used and is being returned.  It's a shame because the previous product was very good and a real workhorse for us.

Back about 11 years ago the C80 was the equivalent of this device for the time. We had exceptional luck with it with many thousands of shreds.

A few improvements over this are evident compared to the older models.

1) This has a 'detection' for hands/fingers being stuck in it. Even a small baby or child can't get this to harm them as the sensor seems to detect HEAT. I can't verify the heat aspect but it really does seem to detect 'living' matter and turn itself off.
2) Auto-Turn on.. Turn it on, shred and walk away and within about 5 minutes this will turn off.. GREAT feature!
3) Much quieter basket. The basket is a honeycomb material that buffers sound very nicely compared to the older plastic ones.
4) Auto-Reshred.. Older ones jammed and had to be reversed, this one does it for you automatically. Very handy and you don't play the back and forth game with thick piles of paper.
5) Thickness meter. A nice feature is this will tell you at the outset if you are attempting to shred piles that are too large. The meter will spike up to red to show you the load is too high.

We use this in the home because we found cheap shredders to be annoying, loud and unreliable. It's well worth spending the money on higher end shredders like this because they can last a decade or more and provide much more reliable service. Strongly recommended!",12-08-2016

However, when I recently purchased this same model to replace the one that just died, I was unable to get the paper bin to close properly and had to return it before even being able to use it. Upon inspection, I saw that they have changed the design of the paper bin so that instead of being solid molded plastic it is now a flexible vinyl with plastic rivets holding the folded vinyl pieces together.  So the whole bin is very flexible and therefore does not make a solid closing.  A sensor in the machine requires the bin to be securely closed for the machine to work. The previous molded plastic bin was not great and often required several tries to close it securely, but this new version is very poorly designed and manufactured.  I also notice that the price is $30 less than it was 3 years ago so perhaps that is reflected in the reduced quality.",11-02-2016

Man, this shredder.

For years I have used a Fellowes P-8C. Running a small home business, I have documents to shred - maybe 5-10 pages per day, but not a huge workload. The problem is, I'm lazy. So I'll toss papers in a box, and when I have accumulated hundreds of things, I'll sit down and I'll shred them all. Now, the aforementioned P-8C is a fine shredder, and if you shred your documents daily, or even once a week, it will serve you well. But if you do what I do, you want the 99Ci. This thing is huge. It has a 9 gallon paper capacity (50% more, on paper, than the P-8C, but it feels like much more than that) and the bin pulls completely out, for easy disposal. No longer will you need to pop the top off your shredder and awkwardly place it on the ground/a table, while remnants of paper shredding go flying everywhere.

The 99Ci takes a considerable stack of paper per pass, and even has a gauge on the top to tell you how efficiently you're using the machine: from 1-2 bars ""eh, that's not enough!"" to 5-6 bars, ""oh man, slow it down a bit"" to the 3-4 bars, indicating optimal efficiency. If you put too much product in for it to shred, it flat-out won't accept that pass until you remove some sheets, so while most shredders usually say they're ""jam proof,"" you literally will need to find a way to trick the 99Ci because it simply won't let you insert too much paper for it to handle.

If you take my ""shred your documents every few months, when there's a huge box of stuff to shred"" approach, this shredder - or one of a similar caliber - will be well worth your month. It's so good, you'll likely find yourself slightly bummed out when you run out of paper to feed through it.",09-12-2016

You may ask yourself, is paper dust a real thing? yes, yes it is.

So, I had a lot of ""documents"" such as old bills and what not, stuff that had account
info on it and such, that I felt would be better to shred for security reasons. I
then pondered if I could use the shredding's with soil for worm bedding? I still
don't know the answer to that.

I wanted something that was going to be reasonably quiet for what it was doing, and
robust, or well built. And the knee jerk reaction of reading fellow verified reviews led me here
to this paper shredder for home use.

So, quick bullet points

+I thought it was too big for home use, then after five minutes the 9 Gallon bin was filled up, and I had to push the stuff down, rinse wash and repeat. Not a big issue.

+The bin is made of plastic corrugated cardboard like material. It surprised me, but I guess it may end up being stronger and lighter than going with plastic. If I want to get hardcore about it, I could always make a bin myself out of sheet metal and rivets. Time will tell on what gives out first. The shredder head, or the bin.

+Quiet. I actually expected it to be louder, but it just quietly nibbles away at the paper

+It's quicker than I thought it would be. Like I expected to be waiting on the shredder, instead it was waiting on me.

+Packaging It's pretty well packed. Corner guards in the box, along with a top and bottom thick formed cardboard covers.
-Instructions are straight forward, like 3 pages. You get three languages. English is easy mode. And then you got Spanish and French.
-You get a small container of ""lubricant"" with the shredder.
-You get bags with the shredder.

+Plug and Play, basically this thing is ready to go right out of the box. Caster wheels just plug right into the housing on the bottom.

Also the extra features like the credit card cutter.
However, I have some doubt as to the longevity of this device.
We had a few dozen boxes of paper that needed shredding, and we went through a few boxes before we burned out our old machine. Granted, that machine was over 20 years old, so it was really a matter of time.
But this machine also burned out after about a dozen boxes. Within 2 weeks!!!
Fellowes was nice enough to send us a new one, so I'm not here to rant and complain.
But again, how long is this going to last us?  The first one didn't even last 2 weeks of heavy use.
I guess we'll see.",07-28-2016

Of course part of this feature is that the motor stops when a too-thick bundle of paper is detected in the slot.  While this can be frustrating, it's much better than a jam.  If the material bogs down the shredder after it's already started shedding, the motor stops, reverses, then powers though in forward again.  I've had no problems shedding CDs or credit cards.

That said, I have two complaints.  Complaint #1: shredded material piles up in the bin without spreading out, causing the bin-full sensor to trip prematurely.  This is easily dealt with by pulling the bin out slightly and shaking it, but out it shouldn't be necessary.  I blame the deep, narrow bin design for this.  Complaint #2: the paper feed slot opening is poorly signed, making it more difficult than necessary to get (paper stacks with) dog-eared pages into the slot.

One last observation: if the paper slot was 1/2"" longer, junk mail envelopes could fit upright, rather than having to turn them on end.",07-14-2016

I bought it in November 2012 and have probably shredded 15,000 sheets with it over the last 3 years/tax seasons.  I have learned to schedule my shred jobs to do 3 or 4 reams of paper per sitting, as the machine usually shuts down for about 40 minutes after shredding this much paper.",11-01-2015

The power button on my first Fellowes shredder stopped working after only a couple or years, and I trashed it since it was out of warranty. The power button on this shredder now requires me to push it three or four times to turn the unit on or off. My last Fellowes did exactly the same thing before it stopped working altogether. It seems unreasonable that a product costing this much money cannot last more than two years before malfunctioning. When this unit stops working, (as I expect it to soon), I will look at other options. Hopefully there will be better options.

***UPDATE*** Fellowes responded to my post and although my shredder was out of warranty I told them the problems started well before warranty expiration. They agreed to send me a replacement power button, which I installed and the shredder is working perfectly again. But since the power buttons on both shredders failed within a couple to three years, if the power button fails again, I would look at another brand.

I can live with it, but I'm not thrilled with it, for the following reasons:

1.  It's SLOW!  I thought this was going to be great for shredding stacks of old documents I no longer need, but it would take so long with this shredder that I'll probably have to use a professional service.

2.  Unlike the videos of this model on the manufacturer's website, that show someone just dropping in a document as they walk by, this shredder does not ""grab"" the paper and send it on its way.  Instead, you have to push the paper down into the shredder before it takes it and slowwwly feeds it through.  This really slows things down.  My cheap old shredder (which is no longer made) grabbed the document immediately; it was really fast.

3.  The drawer that holds the paper shreds is really clunky to pull in and out.  It doesn't have any rails to ride smoothly like a real drawer.  Instead, you have to jostle it in and out, and sometimes it takes a fair amount of jostling to get it back in place.  The drawer also doesn't have any way to secure a plastic bag to hold the shreds.  The drawer isn't designed like a waste bin, where you can just pull the edges of a plastic bag over the edges of the bin.  Instead, one end of the drawer is also the exterior handle used to pull it out.

4.  It doesn't take nearly as much paper as I was expecting it to.  It has a row of lights that indicate whether you putting in too much paper for it to handle.  It doesn't take much for it to indicate that it's too much.  Around five to six sheets is the very most it can handle before protesting.

5.  Yes, like others, I did have to call the manufacturer to find out that the castors have to be hammered into place.  You'd think they could mention that in the instructions.  And they're not all that easy to hammer, given that they're spinning around madly while you're hammering them.

In all, having used it for a couple of weeks and having already discarded the packaging, I guess I'm stuck with it.  But I wouldn't buy it again.",04-28-2015

FASTER than others and well built!,"I like to do a lot of researching for machines I use frequently around the house. I always want the best performing and top quality product and I don't mind spending a little more money to find it. I saw a video review of this compared to other same level shredders (I youtube everything before I buy).

Fast forward - it's FAST compared to others in its class. It's SOLID. It's MOBILE (somewhat). And it's ""SMART"" though I don't know if that's a necessity (jam light detector).

It is on the larger side, but the plug in the back bends downward so you can push it up against the wall more so than other machines - that's a smart idea. Simple things like that prove to me I made the right purchase.

I like that there are two power switches - one in the back (main power) and one in the front on the top. The one on the top is like an on demand button (not a switch). The small round button is flanked by the manual forward/reverse buttons. Use the on demand power button to keep the power on all the time or turn it off when not in use, I choose the latter. By default, the shredder won't run unless there's something in the chute OR if you manually press the forward/reverse button.

The basket is removable and the entire unit glides around on casters. The casters don't lock, but they don't roll around aimlessly. You can choose not to install the casters. When installing the casters use a bit of extra force until they ""pop/click"" into the slot.

The only downside to the shredder that I could see possibly, is that the front power button is a very bright blue light inside of it and it catches your eye's attention. Something like this in an office setting might be an annoyance, so you could probably just put a small piece of electrical tape over it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed that the blue light goes off after a couple of minutes, so the unit looks completely off but will shred on demand when something is placed in the slot. Now I'm even happier than before! ]]

Overall, very pleased with it. I already use it mostly for mail shredding. I'm sure it will be something I keep around for a while.",03-23-2015

Just got this 99Ci to replace a 15 year old low grade/snail speed over a waste basket shredder. Have a lot of paper to shred and a local shredding company wants 10 moola for each shopping bag full, I figured I'll shred myself and get something out of it in the end.

I was debating between this model and the AmazonBasics 24-Sheet Cross-Cut, finally decided on this, mainly due to the 100% Jam Proof, SafeSense, 10 FPM speed (no speed info on the AmazonBasics) and the larger 9 gallon bin features, plus it just looks more well built with better features that the AmazonBasics.

Pros
- Well built, feels solid for its price range.
- The casters were easy to install by myself (this is a man's job)
- Instructions were clear and easy to understand (this is also a man's job)
- The bin slides in and out easily.
- The capacity indicator is pretty cool, handy if trying to insert too many pages, which prevents jamming.
- The SafeSense feature, good for safety, plus if you keep your hand on there for more than 3 seconds, the machine actually turns off completely.
- First tested with 20 pages of 20lb copy paper, it was too thick and the capacity indicator was in the red, shredding would not even start, until I got down to 18 pages, then shredding went through without any problems.
- My first real batch of shredding completely filled a 12""x12""x8"" box, lots of old invoices and statements, took about 25-30 minutes, almost ran it continuously. The shredder finally overloaded right when I finished, went into cool down mode, but I noticed that the overload red light went off about 15-20 minutes later, but the motor felt pretty warm still. I have many more of those boxes of paper to go.
- Within the 25-30 minutes of shredding, only one jam due to too many pages, hit the reverse button to back it out a little, then forward button to finish shredding it.
- When shredding lots of pages, you can tell that the sound of the motor is stressing, but just a little though, still pretty quiet and will shred the 18 pages quickly, does not really slow down much at all.
- 10 feet per minute seems pretty fast for this level of shredder, compared to my old snail shredder.
- Junk mail: I luv it that I can just throw the average junk mail (unopened) right into the shredder.
- Did try to insert stacks of paper in crooked, so that it'd fold during shredding, but it never got jammed once.

Minor Cons
- Even with a 9 gallon bin, because the shredded paper is pretty fluffed, it gets full pretty quick, even though the paper gets distributed in the bin pretty evenly by itself. Within the 25-30 minutes, I filled two bins and had to pad down the paper around 4 times per bin and oiled the blade at least twice per bin. If you are using a bag to hold the paper and you pad down the paper as much as possible, when you pull the bag out, the inside part of the bin window have cornered edges, which will rip the bag, but of course this will most likely not happen if you do not pad down the paper.
- You have to insert the paper about 2-3 inches into the slot before it'll start shredding, but you'll get used to it quickly.

Miscellaneous
- Instructions state that it should be turned off when done shredding, not a big deal with a simple push of the on/off button.
- Since the bin gets filled pretty quick and you are supposed to oil the blade with every emptying of the bin, make sure you get yourself a nice big bottle of shredder oil, or vegetable oil (non aerosol) and get an applicator with a long nozzle.
- This model does have the Energy Savings Feature, it's not stated on Amazon, but it's on the manufacturer's site.

Conclusion
- As long as it last for years to come, am very happy with the purchase. I believe I read about a plastic gear that was used in the previous model SB-99Ci, hopefully the issue with that is now fixed with this current model.
- Now that I have a much better shredder, shredding is ""ALMOST"" fun.

BTW: I'm just kidding with the being a man's job comments, I believe in complete equality. You go girl!

>> UPDATE 1/21/2015
Just out of curiosity, I just had to find some DVDs to shred, which I found about 10, threw each one into the shredder, one after another, no problems at all, it was actually fun and enjoyable, at least this first time.

I was also curious about the shredding oil, so I called Fellowes to get more info, here is what it comes down to:
- Any vegetable oil will work.
- Typically, one found at super markets will have a smell to it and one found at office stores will not. The ones with the smell is for cooking, the only difference is that it has a smell, but both work the same. I prefer no smell, so I guess I'll have to pay a little more for that one.
- The manual suggest that every time the bin indicator lights up that it's full(without padding down the shredded material), you should squirt some shredding oil on the blades. But, if you want to pad down the shredded material every so long, to prolong when it is actually completely full, so that when the bin is finally truly full even by padding down the shredded material, you can then squirt some shredding oil on the blades, so that you do not have to oil it as often.

I luv this shredder, so far.",01-14-2015

It's a quiet machine...not whisper quiet, but quiet (I use it at home...and it doesn't wake up my newborn).  It shreds a healthy stack of papers in no time at all.  I have yet to have it over heat, which is great because the fact that it's supposed to run up to 25 minutes before needing to cool down was key for me given the large amount of old paperwork that I needed to shred...my old 8 sheet shredder shuts down after 5 minutes.

The safety feature truly works...it senses my fingers/hand and shuts down the shredder until a split second after I remove my hand.

It comes with 4-5 plastic bags to start you off in the huge bin that it comes with.  It also comes with a tiny (VERY TINY) amount of oil for lubricating the blades when needed.

I really would like a micro-cut but this cross cut is fine.  I cannot imagine any thief trying to sort through a 9-gallon bag of cross -cut paper shreds.  Yeah could happen, but most likely safe....especially given the fact that there are numerous other people who don't shred and some thief will find it easier to sort through their un-shredded stuff vs piecing together 9-gallons of reasonably fine cross shredding!

- when something is too large and may jam it, it will stop briefly, and auto-reverse, then try again.

CONS:
- it's large.  you'll need a place to store this where it's still convenient to pull out and use when required.
- when ""full"" stops the machine, there's often lots of dangly bits hanging from the shredding mechanism still and can sometimes cling onto it until after you've pulled the bin all the way out.  you will have to open slightly and knock it loose so it falls in the bin to avoid a big mess when pulling the bin out completely.",11-02-2014

I usually just leave the feed running non-stop while I shred to get around this. But in reality, the motor is capable of shredding at least 10 22lb sheets at a time before it sounds like its struggling.

This shredder has a tendency to give a false reading of a full basket when the problem is a jam in the cutters which activates the full basket sensor. To clear the jam you must reach underneath the cutters and remove the clumped up partially cut papers. You cannot clear the jam any other way. Moreover, the shredder does an extremely poor job shredding glossy paper and basically runs it through the cutters without shredding it completely. If you do buy this shredder, which is not recommended, you should buy several bottles of Fellowes shredder oil because you will need them. The oil helps a little but not much. I have only used this shredder for personal mail and sensitive papers and have never used it outside of my house or commercially.

It really does gobble gobs of paper, and if you stuff too much into the shredder slot, it will slow down, sometimes back up the paper, then take it down again. It corrects its own jams too. The two things that can still cause a jam: shredded paper will pile up in the shredder bin like a mini-mountain of shredder discards piled high. When the mini-mountain gets too high, the outfeed from the shredder is blocked, and the shredder will jam. You need to pull the bin out, push down the loose-shredded material, then shove the bin in again, and the shredder will start up by itself.  It is recommended you buy shredder oil; the shredder shreds so much paper, those shredder teeth need more lube--and it has to be shredder lube.

With my old shredder, I forgot to read the instructions and
did not service the shredder by applying vegetable oil to the cutters after each drawer fill up, so the old one broke down after a couple of years. The drawer size of 9 gallons takes my 13 gallon biodegradable bag nicely. You can stretch the bag over the back of the drawer, and the front has two protruding notches for the bag. I had lots of paper to shred, and completed 9 bags filled over a few days. Machine works well although none are extremely quiet.
The specs. say you can shred 17 sheets. I prefer keeping the number of sheets in the green light. I found the following:
17 sheets = red light.  14-16 sheets = Orange 2 light.  11-13 sheets = Orange 1 light.  9-10 sheets = green 5 light.
  8 sheets = green 4 light.  4-7  sheets = green 3  light.  3 sheets = green 2 light.  2 sheets = green 1 light.

Must use vegetable oil on the cutter after filling each bag. You can buy shredder oil or I assume use any clear vegetable oil.

Dislikes: Very minor issues. The castor wheels really need to be pounded into place.  I used clear shipping tape to smooth the edges inside the drawer around the viewing port. This keeps the bag from tearing when full.  The cut paper tends to bunch up directly under the cutter which trips the ""full' red light. You may have to open the drawer and pat down the paper three or four times before bag is full.  The small bottle of oil supplied is pretty small and you will have to make a stopper for it. Fellowes make a 12 oz. bottle with an extension nozzle that is too large. This really wastes the oil. I found a travel bottle with flip up nozzle that works well (try Target).",12-25-2013

I recently shredded three years' worth of old payroll reports and sales reports from work in about 30 minutes. (Ours is not a huge organization, but we still conduct annual sales of about about $340,000, if that helps with visualizing the amount of materials shredded.)

UPDATE, 2015/09/24: I had originally given this shredder five stars, and if I were only rating the mechanical parts of it, I would give it five stars still. The shredder and all of its features still work extremely well after two years.

The only problem has been with the design of the cabinet. The rounded corners at the bottom front seem not to have enough material to support the weight of the shredder itself. The plastic around the front left caster collapsed around six months ago. I repaired it successfully with J-B Plastic Weld Putty&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/J-B-Weld-8237-PlasticWeld-Plastic-Repair-Epoxy-Putty-2-oz-2-Pack/dp/B00PSOHA0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">J-B Weld 8237 PlasticWeld Plastic Repair Epoxy Putty - 2 oz. 2 Pack</a>&nbsp;(which is a great product!). Then about three months later the plastic around the front right caster collapsed in very much the same way (even the cracks were in the same places). Again, I repaired it successfully with J-B Plastic Weld Putty. If I were rating this shredder based on this only, I would probably have to give it one star. Although making the repairs was of little import to me, the fact that I had to speaks volumes.

Now, I know the average between one and five is three, but I decided the quality of the shredder machinery and safety features should be given greater weight, hence, four stars.",08-22-2013

I run it through without ever opening it.  Description says it can't be jammed.  I wondered how they could claim this.  There is a sensor that will shut the shredder down if the paper stack you are trying to shred is too thick.  So in essence it doesn't try to take on more than it can handle.  I've done my best to test it.  I have managed to make it stop and reverse the shred a couple times.

I researched available models and decided on the Fellows 99Ci.  The Fellows 125Ci is almost double the price and I thought was probably overkill for my needs.
Amazon shipping was stellar as usual. UPS delivery to my front door.
Shredder technology has come a long way in 10 years.  This model is very quiet  and in comparison to my old one that you had to almost wear ear protection when using. You could talk on the phone and shred at the same with the Fellows shredder with barely any notice.  Jam free technology automatically clears any paper jams. Safety features look improved also to protect against finger intrusion (not that I plan on testing this feature)  It says you can put in up to 17 pages at a time but this is only for very thin paper.  Standard weight copy paper is closer to 7-8 pages.  Indicator lights glow green-yellow-red to let you know if you are putting too much in.  The bin is decent capacity for home use. The way the paper falls into the bin will turn on the ""bin full"" light a little prematurely as it mounds up. Just pull out the basket and redistribute the shredded paper in the basket  to get more capacity.  Fellows recommends using the supplied oil after each bag change.  The bottle of oil looks like it should last 5 years.  The machine looks very robust and well made.  Maximum continuous run time is 25 minutes which is a whole lot of shredding if you needed to get rid of a box of documents quickly (like get out of the embassy quick).  If you need to shred bank or credit card statements, confidential documents, etc. the 99Ci looks perfect for the job.  Cross cutting gives you peace of mind about putting the shredded pieces out for trash or recycling that nobody will read your confidential information.",03-12-2013

First one was one of those that you fit over a standard garbage (that jammed easily). Then I upgraded to one that could handle up to 12 sheets, but after 7 plus years of use a part broke where it runs all the time unless unplugged and that got old so I went back on the hunt for a new one. After a lot of back and forth I decided on this one and I do not regret it at all. It is...
1. Powerful.
2. Cuts the paper in small particles instead of long strips.
3. Quiet, extremely quiet. In fact, it's so quiet that I now can shred stuff while people are on the phone or/and watching TV and it's no bother.
4. Durable.

I haven't had it long but I am quite pleased with this purchase. Great find!

As far as the sensor, as you play with it you figure out ways past it. I have had it tell me things were too thick to shred and I would just press and hold the forward button and it shredded it just fine. These things so far seem to be built to shred, but I doubt last. I believe if I continue to do that I will eventually break it so I need to be careful on that for things are just not built like they used to be. However, if you follow what the sensor tells you, then I am sure it will last a good 5 plus years. Also, that sensor where it detects if your finger is touching it while is shredding actually works. Sometimes can get annoying but it serves a useful purpose so for that reason I can look past that.",01-15-2013

In the past couple of years, our business has grown; and, due to the number of federal documents with personal information that we handle, we do a lot of shredding. :)

Anyway, when I went out to buy a new shredder, it didn't even dawn on me that I would be able to find an affordable unit with the performance of this Fellowes shredder!

Here are the things we like about it:

- There are definitely limits to what it can shred at one time - but it does such a great job monitoring itself that it doesn't seem possible to jam it.

- The output bin is large enough to be truly useful, and is also easy to empty.  The shredded paper will kind of stack up in the middle - so we generally have to open it up and spread the paper bits around about once for every time we fill the bin up.  That's not a big deal at all considering we can fit 3 to 4 times the amount of shredded paper that our old unit held.

- It is quiet.  This was definitely an unexpected & pleasant surprise.  It is definitely not silent; but, it just emits a deep hum instead of the high pitched sound our old unit had.

- It looks good and is easily maneuverable thanks to the caster wheels.

- I love the safety feature where it will turn off if you touch the shredder input.  I've tested it and it works great.

- I know most paper shredders have a front window; but, that is also a nice feature.

- The shredding is very effective and results in nice small pieces.

The only downside I can even remotely think of is that the blades require occasional oiling; but, I deal with a lot of equipment and think that is pretty normal for a high-performance machine like this one.  I do wish, however, that the instructions had more info on how much oil is optimal - or how often we should oil the blades.

Overall, if you're looking for a high-performance shredder that won't break the bank, then I highly recommend this unit!  It probably sounds dumb to get excited about a paper shredder - but the performance of this PowerShred has absolutely blown me away!",12-13-2012

Then, it hit me that there might be a reset button on it.  Sure enough on the back of the shredder there is a power switch.  Apparently, a power surge had knocked out my power.  I  flipped that little switch and it was perfect again.  So, of course, I cancelled my return.  It says it will take 17 pages.  That's a bit of a stretch.  If you want to clog your machine, you can try 17 pages; however, about half that many will work better.  I have had my beast for three months now, and have done some pretty heavy-duty shredding--shredding a bunch of old income tax returns, etc., and she is humming right along.  I also love how quiet it is.  I have a smaller one that is much louder than this one.",11-27-2012

However, I'm not happy with this product.  The problems I encountered with the use of this shredder are as follow:  The 99Ci does not shred junk mail, i.e., unopened envelopes that contain more than 3 or 4 sheets of paper.  The machine is too sensitive in that it stops shredding when the paper bin is only half full, requiring frequent emptying of the bucket, which is a nuisance.  The 99Ci is advertised as having the capability to shred up to 17 sheets of paper at a time, but in my experience, sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't; and when it does, it struggles to get the job done.  I haven't had a chance to test the machine's cool-down period that would be required after 25 minutes of continuous use, and therefore cannot provide any useful comment about that particular function.  In a nutshell, the 99Ci that I received and have used does not justify its high price.  The manufacturer should either improve this product, carefully check them all before they leave the assembly line, or lower the unit cost.",09-19-2012

Instead, get the OBi device I describe below. MagicJack's Tech Support Department claims that their device does NOT work with Alexa.

IF you will be using corded phones or a cordless phone, you could use either the MagicJack (with a monthly service fee) or one of the OBi units (FREE monthly service available). Read below to compare the two types of unit:

RATINGS:

ZERO STARS if you plan to use AMAZON ALEXA and ECHO CONNECT
FOUR STARS if you plan to use regular home phone devices

MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE MAGIC JACK GO:

I originally bought this unit in January 2015, had trouble with that first unit, so Amazon sent me a second unit, I was happy with the new unit, so I prepaid for six years of monthly service in order to lock in $2.25 per month service, a bargain at the time.

At first, I used the service flawlessly with a Panasonic cordless phone, then in January 2018, I got the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Echo-Connect/dp/B076ZRFP6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Echo Connect</a>&nbsp;so that I could make and receive phone calls on my Amazon Alexa (Echo) devices. I loved it, and got six months of service from this pairing.

In July 2018, after six months of PERFECT service with the MagicJack connected to my Alexa, it suddenly stopped working. I described the problem to Amazon Tech Support, so they sent me a new ""Connect"" just in case it was the problem, then I got in touch with MagicJack technical support who told me that MagicJack DOES NOT WORK with Echo Connect. After a long chat one evening, and after 90 minutes on the phone with their premium concierge phone support, I finally told them to cancel my account. I freely abandoned 2 years of prepaid service because of their runaround. (I had given them two choices, one choice to keep me at a customer that would involve me paying them a total of $30 to end up with a new MagicJack that, by their own admission, they did not warrant to work with Echo; or abandon their service, cancel my account, and find a better alternative.

The supervisor canceled my premium account and I assured her that I'd look for another alternative. Within an hour, I found what appeared to be a better solution and ordered it.

MY EXPERIENCE WITH ONE OF THEIR COMPETITORS !!!

Today, the better solution arrived. I am very happy that MagicJack told me that they would NOT support my Amazon Echo unit:

If you have one, two, three or four Google Voice phone numbers, and do not have a home phone number (or if you are willing to abandon home hard-wired service), then I recommend that you compare the MagicJack devices with the OBi devices:

*&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/OBi200-1-Port-VoIP-Phone-Adapter-with-Google-Voice-and-Fax-Support-for-Home-and-SOHO-Phone-Service/dp/B00BUV7C9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">OBi200 1-Port VoIP Phone Adapter with Google Voice and Fax Support for Home and SOHO Phone Service</a>&nbsp;*

This is the unit that arrived today which I am very happy with. After a few hours of SETUP, I now have the ability to receive phone calls from two different Google Voice numbers (I could have up to four different numbers). I can easily make calls on my default GV number, but by dialing **2, I can make calls that come ""from"" my second number.

I am single, so I only need to be able to use one phone line at a time, so this basic unit is perfect for me, but IF I had a wife or kids, I could have gotten the two-line version which would support two different people able to talk on two different phone calls at the same time, and still support up to four GV phone numbers.

The Google Voice service itself even lets me screen calls. You can read more about that at voice. google .com.

CONCLUSION:

Read all the details of both the MagicJack and the OBi200 unit to decide what is best for you, but IF you plan to connect your VOIP number to your ALEXA device, be aware that MagicJack's technical support department does not support the Alexa device (at least they tell people it does not work, probably to avoid learning new technology, or because they like to blame problems on other manufacturers).",07-20-2018

Given the fact that a year of service is included in the cost of the device, I have to say that it is a great value for the money.  However, I was not very pleased with the call quality and features.  I only made a few calls, but all of them seemed to have static in the background which I found very distracting and made it difficult for the person on the other end to hear me clearly.  There is also an issue that causes the timestamp associated with caller id and voice mail to be reported incorrectly, and considering how long MagicJack has been around, the fact that they provide no means of correcting that is inexcusable.  Consequently, I do not plan to continue using MagicJack.  While I appreciate the value they offer for the price, it is not the service for me.",04-27-2018

But, with MJ you can block numbers as opposed to Basic Talk.  Its definitely cheaper than Basic Talk (over $120).  Robocalls still persist.  You can prepay for the next year with MJ.

1.  Can power several phones in your network, I was nervous about this.  So happy I can use most of my phones.
2.  Very clear sound.
3.  Saving over $300 versus ATT VOIP phone(rip off, way too high)
4.  The 1st year is included with the purchase of the device
5.  Very easy to setup, had up and running around 10 minutes.
6.  Had Ooma before and so far they all sound the same.  Although Ooma has more features, this is way cheaper.
7.  Can't wait to utilize the Android app more to make calls and text.
8.  The thought of paying $80-$90 for 3 years after the included 1st year of service really sounds enticing.
9. Able to block 10 callers, has caller id and voice mail.
10. Can retrieve voice messages for any house phone connected or Android app.
Cons:
1.  Couldn't figure out why I couldn't call in to my number, so I plugged in one phone and it worked.  Bottom line, can't connect all phones, had to unplug 2 out of 7 phones to allow incoming calls.  I believe the device does not have enough power for all the phones.
2.  A slight delay, but I don't believe it is that noticeable, especially for the price.
3.  Nomorobo.com does not work with MagicJack.  I did email the company to accept this service.
4,  No pc dialer software or caller id software when plugged into ethernet/router
5.  911 emergency will cost extra.
6.  Porting a number costs $19.99 extra, maybe able to get $10 off.

Other thoughts:
Even if this thing has glitches down the line, I'll sacrifice that over the cheap price.",01-01-2018

We were able to SAVE A LOT OF MONEY by making this Magicjack phone our main phone.  We lowered our phone bill by hundreds of dollars per year.

The one slight issue is an obvious one - it relies on the internet.  If your internet goes out, you have no phone!  If you have a really dependable ISP, then that should not be a problem.  Out here in the country, the connection does fail occasionally, so we can be without a phone until it comes back on.  We got a pay-as-you-go cell phone to make up for those outages.  Just be aware and be ready.  However, that is NO problem with Magicjack, just our internet service provider.",10-31-2017

At first it had to work with my PC until they developed a ""Plus"" model that could connect directly to a router. I have two lines and also had my brother switch from ATT in Reno. Our experience has been excellent. The present day line quality supports fax with no issues, and best of all there is an mJ app for my Android phone. It has its native number and a second mJ number. Since 2014 when visiting friends in Alberta, I can make free calls to the US with that app. The native smartphone number and the mJ number each have distinctive rings. I buy 5 years worth of time for each line and the one in Reno, making the monthly cost extremely low. It has been very reliable. I wouldn't consider doing anything else. magicJack has its own network, so there is no dependence on the grace of Google to provide free lines. In line years we've collectively saved thousands on telephone service. The setup is very easy. Occasionally the little power bricks may fail as one did for my brother. This is a common universal equipment problem actually. mJ customer service will give you replacements just for a small shipping cost. I consider mJ to be a top VoIP provider. Vonage has a more complete offering but at a far higher cost. I never missed having Vonage after switching.",10-17-2017

I now have a Samsung 2.1 amp phone charger transformer on it and it has been flawless. When the GO came out I bought one for another location. It comes with a usb extension. Use it to plug the transformer to the Go. This keeps the two heat sources away from each other. Both run cooler when not plugged directly together. No problems with it so far. They know the transformers are a weak link. If you go to their website you will notice the price is free. Maybe some postage if not under warrenty?

I purchased the device ($50) six years ago mainly to have a fax line (which works fine even at 33.6 kbps) and its still going strong.  I purchase five year plans at $100, which comes out to just $1.67/month. I also sometimes make use of MJ using the iOS application on my iDevices.  I have three numbers in two different area codes.  One is the number that I use for my three fax machines that is assigned to the actual devices and the other two are numbers that I use with the iOS devices.  Six years ago, I moved from one location to another and wanted to keep the number that I had for decades for voice.  I use that number as one of my iPOd numbers and the other number is a local area code number that I also sometimes use for voice.  I believe I did pay extra for those numbers, but it was minimum ($10 each?) and they renew for free when I renew my five year $100 plan.  I'm in my second five year plan now (time goes by fast).  I'm happy with the service.

Clicked on what the link sent me to renew for 5 years and paid the $100+ dollars and thought all was good....  Did not work the next day or the next so tried to contact Magicjack to figure out.  There in lies one of the second worst part of the product - customer support.  Tried filing on-line form and then filed again as did not hear back.  Got an email back telling me renewed the 10-year old non-existent non-functioning for past 9 years and in a landfill for past 9 years Original Magicjack.  I emailed back  that I followed the link that they emailed me to re-up...  but ok, let's fix this and correct the 5-year subscription to the correct Magicjack that has been being used for past year and was informed that they could not so this.  They could for another $40 send me an archaic ancient style that was the original (the one that sucks and did not remotely work very well).  I informed them that was not acceptable and they needed to fix the error.  at which point I get the run around... I was then transferred to a ""senior agent"" MJ and started all over again and went through the same conversation to finally get to the point that what was taking place was purely wrong, not-ethical and quite frankly should be illegal as it is very similar to scamming a customer at which point MJ said that she could not transfer it to the correct number but I could spend another $100+ to renew the correct number for 5 years and then she would process for a credit back to me for the error.  She sounded genuine and it made sense so I spent another $100+ and did this and even Thanked Her for her help....  That was Nov 17 2016 and 2 months later I still have not received the refund for the error!  That is the worst part - they are not trust worthy and once they have your money you are mince meat.  Truly sad as I do believe the latest version is a good product, but with this kind of customer service I have had to cange my advice to family and friends and now recommend them to stay away from Magicjack products.

But the included pamphlet says it should only be plugged to a phone, and not into a wall outlet (see attached pic).
My previous MagicJack Plus (not 2014 Plus) was plugged into a wall outlet, so all phones connected to that line in the house could use that MagicJack.
My remaining credit (6 weeks) and international pre-paid credit balance transferred over from my Plus account/device to my new GO device: just follow the registration process on their website and don't register the GO as a new line of service if you are transferring from an old MJ account, and all will be fine.

Update:
Connecting it to a Wall outlet works fine, like the previous version.
Software says version 4.1 (in 9/2016)
Other than visual differences, I can't tell a functional difference between the GO and the Plus.
See [...] for visual differences in the MagicJack device over the years.

Update:
Downgrading the rating..
The new GO device doesn't establish a connection when I reboot my PC (Windows 10).
I have to unplug and plug it back into the USB port for it to establish a connection.
I use it with my PC USB port because I want to use the SoftPhone (by TigerJet, I think), recent call history, contacts, etc.

I can never seem to retrieve the voice messages through their software without having to unplug the system and replug it in to reboot it.  Thankfully, the voice messages appear in my emails.  Sometimes though, I can only access the voice messages through their software by having to go through their Live Chat first to have them refresh the connection. Probably have to do this weekly.  Really crappy software.  Plus, they don't allow you to create volume defaults so I have to manually change the volume settings every time I turn on my computer.

OUT OF THE BOX, the electric charger was defective.  Took months to determine that and then I was out of warrantee.  Had to pay ""shipping"" for a new one which I refused.  While the number ported over finally, I never had a caller ID.  I submitted many tickets on this with no result.  Finally, I was told that all providers to not update IDs.  My caller ID shows as UNKNOWN which is not good because it is a business line.  People do not pick up when the caller ID says UNKNOWN so you need to be aware of this liability.  Of course, this is not DISCLOSED as are other potential issues.  Over the past 8-9 month, I had such static on the line, it was impossible to have any calls.  While they say, you can use with a fax machine, this caused the static on my line which I have disconnected and eliminated the static.  Anytime I need to send a fax, I have to go through a wiring exercise.  My latest PROBLEM, was my line was dead.  Every day in the afternoon, my connection would die.  It didn't matter if I was on a call or not - the line just went dead.  After hours with ""customer service"", they could not say or would not say but implied that maybe my device was bad.  They then implied that maybe my ISP was disconnecting the line since they lost that business.  My ISP sucks and I tend to think this is an ISP issue as well as the inability to update the caller ID.  Magic Jack will not say this because people won't buy the product knowing these possible issues.  The bottom line is that you get what you pay for.  If you can live and deal with these issues then, by all means, MAGIC JACK IS FOR YOU",07-22-2016

It costs $35 per year for service, and a new unit comes with a year of prepaid service.  So those used units you see selling for $20 to $30 are worthless and actually cost MORE than a new unit.

NO Monthly Bill. 2017 (1 Pack),4,5,I Wired My Whole House With a Single Magic Jack,"I bought Magic Jack on a whim, when I found a box of my old landline phones in the back of my closet, and decided to try to hook them up.  It turned out great!

My house was completely wired for telephone service when it was built, and there are lots of phone outlets throughout the house, but I turned off my land line about four or five years ago.  I plugged the Magic Jack into the phone outlet near my router (instead of into a single phone, as the instructions indicate).  Now all the jacks in my house work, and I have phones hooked up all over -- all with a single Magic Jack!

Also, to push Magic Jack to its limits, I wanted to have a phone near my computer.  But naturally, that wall outlet was being taken up by the Magic Jack line that was connected to my router.  So, on a hunch, I invested a few dollars in a splitter.  (Look up ""phone splitter"" on Amazon for some examples.)  Then I connected the Magic Jack to one of the splitter outlets, a telephone to the second splitter outlet, then plugged the splitter into the wall.  Amazingly, the Magic Jack continued to work, and I now have a working phone right next to my router, as well as working phones throughout the rest of my three-story house.  Frankly, I'm a little surprised that the splitter idea worked.  I'm no engineer, and I'm not sure how the single wall outlet near my router can shoot the Magic Jack signal into the wall and throughout my house, then send it back out to a phone next to my router.  But, somehow, it does.

Magic Jack doesn't seem to advertise this multi-phone feature for its product.  It appears from online discussions that some people have trouble setting it up, due to house wiring or other issues, so Magic Jack probably doesn't want to oversell its product.  But I guess I'm one of the lucky ones, because it worked great for me.  Your results may vary.  But it shouldn't be any problem to at least hook up one phone, and combined with the phone number and voicemail applications, this was money well spent.",06-18-2016

We rarely use the landline now, and only decide to keep the number because we've had it for forever. It was very easy to port [transfer] our number over to Magicjack and only took about 4 days [the website says to allow them 5-10 days]. During that time, you can make outgoing calls, but you cannot receive calls. This was not a huge deal since we only really get telemarketers calling. Also, you can opt to not include emergency service calling, which doesn't really save you that much, but it's nice to have the option. The setup was easy: you just plug the Magicjack into the outlet, connect the ethernet cable to your router or modem, and your phone line into the other port in the Magicjack. All the materials and cables come with the Magicjack. You'll set up your number and account online, which only takes about 5 minutes. I did not notice any sound quality different compared to other service providers. You also get free calls to all of the US and Canada. The only issue that I heard of, but didn't experience yet, is that your calls can only last about 1 hour before Magicjack disconnects you, however, you can call the person back again. Their customer service team is very helpful in answering any and all your questions. This is a great product and I highly recommend it.",06-12-2016

NO Monthly Bill. 2017 (1 Pack),4,5,"My home phone lines are virtually free and the Magic Jack App gives simultaneous ring on your cell phone, too!.","I used to have a Magic Jack Plus... but after a few years added a Magic Jack GO for a second number.  The Magic Jack GO comes with 12 months of free US telephone service and is similar to the EXPRESS but it's black..  The EXPRESS is white and comes with only 3 months of US telephone service.  I bought this one to replace the Magic Jack Plus since I already have paid for five years of phone service.

I'm a true convert to the Magic Jack VOIP phone service.  It saves so much money over the cost of other types of land line phones available.  The key of course is that you must have internet service.  These do NOT require your computer to be on for use, however messages are emailed to you if you don't answer the phone.

One of the other great benefits is that you can carry the device with you for use overseas... anywhere there is WiFi, you plug the device into your computer.  You do need a way to hook up a phone of some kind to this when  you travel.  I purchased a small device that works as a phone.  However in one hotel, once I connected with WIFI I just used the hotel phone in my room and plugged it into Magic Jack.

If you have friends/family living overseas, this is a great thing to get... set it up in the USA and mail it to them for free communication via wifil.

The other big plus is the Magic Jack App.  With this, you can use the SIMULTANEOUS RING feature making both the Magic Jack and your Cell Phone ring at the same time no matter where you may be.  Recently it seems that they've improved this service so that when you return a call, your magic Jack number shows up as the caller ID number.

Initially you could not receive texts this way, but I think as of this date, 3-30-16 - that it's changing.  I use my second magic jack as a business number for my home office.  I've been wanting to streamline the number of phone numbers I have to give to people or post on a business card, so texting to this one number is a good feature.... I just have to verify that this new development really works.

The biggest thing however for me is the massive cost savings for my telephone service using this.  I've also seen periodically that the company may offer the device at a sale price.  The EXPRESS  comes with 3 months of phone service, and the Magic Jack GO comes with 12 months of service.

I purchased the Express to replace my old Magic Jack Plus - which is no longer sold.  The old PLUS could not be given away and was unusable.  It is not clear if that will happen with either the Express or Go, but you may want to call tech support if you set it up, and don't keep the subscription paid.  It may be unusable at a later date if you don't keep the subscription paid.  At this low cost that really shouldn't be too much of a problem.",03-31-2016

You can have a land line for convenience at this price even TWO!!!,"I ditched my regular land line because the bill keeps going up up  up... I had a magic jack PLUS for a lot of years.  I purchased a Magic Jack GO when I knew I was intending to begin a home based business... and just before a trip out of the USA to Mexico.  I carried the GO with me and was able to plug in my laptop and plug the hotel phone into the Magic Jack GO and could make and receive ""free"" calls back to the US for the time I was out of the country. It was GREAT!!!

I did replace the PLUS with an EXPRESS when the Plus began to drop calls.  The other thing I did was to purchase a 2 line traditional phone from a regular store, and plugged in both the Magic Jack GO and Express... so now I have a two line phone in my home office and three additional cordless extensions on the three floors of my house.

The big plus is that the office phone also connects with two cell phones via blue tooth... so now when I'm at home I have ONE phone that allows me to answer all four and I don't have to scramble looking to find a phone ringing on the first floor in my purse when I'm upstairs.

I also set my ""business"" cell (Android) and Magic Jack Go up with the SIMULTANEOUS RING feature which works great when I'm out and on the go.  I am told that currently since I have both Magic Phones registered to the same ONE account that I can only have ONE android phone using the simultaneous ring feature at one time.  I was told that if my second phone was an iPhone then I could use two.

The cost savings is TREMENDOUS.  I pay on the five year plan and love that I won't have a bill till the next DECADE begins.  That part is really cool.

You just need the right ISP so that everything works seamlessly.  It's a great investment that pays for itself almost immediately.

The only challenge is that every 8 months or so, you may have to reset it.  I was told that it is because the ISP does upgrades periodically and it changes the way the phone connects.",03-06-2016

I have moved it from various rooms, houses, different  types of modems and routers, in 3 different states in the US, and it just keeps working.  Friends report excellent voice clarity.  This year's renewal cost me $37, far far less than any phone company plan would have cost.  It's simple: All you need is an internet connection.

Even if your local POTS phone bill runs $20 a month, that's $240/year. Take the $180 you'll save and buy yourself something pretty. You will need broadband internet service and at least one available Ethernet port, which most everyone has, to connect to the Magic Jack service. Most big companies have been using VOIP (Voice over Internet) for years, and there's no reason you shouldn't too.

Regarding the service, we have had very little problem with line noise or connectivity, as we've seen in some of the other reviews. Once in a while, we'll hear some faint clicking on the line, but we have not dropped one single phone call in well over a year. Other folks have remarked that they can't get a dial tone, but every time we've picked it up, we've successfully connected. If you have spotty internet service, that may be the reason for a majority of those problems. We have 30 MBPS down and 3 MBPS up, and even when streaming Netfilx or Hulu on two devices, our MJ phone works perfectly.

We did have one issue. About 14 or 15 months into our MJ, our USB power adapter died. It does get pretty darn hot, so I assume its internal board burned out. We went to the Magic Jack website and ordered a replacement for FREE (small shipping/handling fee), plugged it in, and we were up and running right away.

Some other neat features include voice message to e-mail. You can have your MJ send your voicemail recordings directly to your email account as a small attachment, which in our busy business, is tremendously helpful. I check messages on my smartphone while on the road. You can also select from a wide range of ""vanity"" phone numbers, where you can select your entire or at least the last four digits of your new phone number. Porting is also available, where you can actually transfer your existing cell or home phone number to your MJ account, but we've never tried that.

Overall, we're quite happy with our Magic Jack service over the past five years. We have two now, one at home, and one at our office.",02-04-2016

NO Monthly Bill. 2017 (1 Pack),4,4,Great Choice For Limited Use,"We had to replace our DSL with cable Internet due to repeated problems.  We only had the home phone because we needed it for the DSL, but we have a certain nostalgia for our phone number and all the sites we use reference it for password resets.  So we picked up the Magicjack as a limited backup since we could port our number over to it.  We spent $50 for the device and they said $10, but it was closer to $11 with ""fees"", and they came back telling us we had DSL on our account and to resubmit if we wanted that cancelled too.  So resubmitted, no extra charge I can see, they closed out the other account and no fuss.

I have read they're bad, trying to charge $30 if you want to port your number away from them later, but we'll probably abandon the number after a year or so.  Also, if a post I saw is true, someone said you can just neglect to pay their $30 when  you are porting it out, just cancel out of paying, and they are legally required to port it anyway, but it'll just mean they wait as long as they can and maybe take a week.  No idea if that (still) works, but mentioning in case someone wants to try.  They also have some kind of jerk things in their terms about being able to cancel your calls that go too long (90 mins seems to be the value reported most), that if you don't make a call every 90 days they can take back your number, not letting you transfer remaining value to a new device, and if you use a certain amount more than their average user they can limit you.  Those kind of clauses in the terms make me really uncomfortable trusting them.

The call quality has been perfectly fine and nobody seems to tell the difference between my old real phone and this VoIP phone.  It does get pretty hot, which is a little concerning, but if it doesn't burn itself out it's not a concern.  We run it without ever connecting it to a computer so no chance for it to download any software on our PC; that makes me happy.  I've only played a little with the call features, but so far so good.  The 911 service will charge you a monthly fee if your municipality charges them a fee.  We lucked out and it was free for us.  You could always get an emergency number from your municipality that isn't 911, but the e911 service at least provides services the address you coded on the device.

So far, the experiment is going well and we're very happy with the device.  If they do anything to screw us, I'll come back and lower my review, but barring that we may even keep this past the year we'd planned to.",02-01-2016

NO Monthly Bill. 2017 (1 Pack),4,5,Great value for a basic line,"I had one of the original magicjacks 6-7 years ago and used it for a business back then.  The voice quality was pretty good but required your PC to work.  Now that I created another startup I am using the new VOIP version and it is working even better, voice is crystal clear.  If you have a need for nothing more than a basic line, you can not beat this.  Grab a cheap 9GHz cordless to connect to it and you are golden, I use a VTEC CS6629 and haven't had a problem yet.  The bonus is that if you travel often, you can just take it and the phone with you in a small bag and hook it up anywhere there is internet.

The cons as I see it:
The price has gone up a bit since the original magicjack, though still a great deal
They nickle and dime you to death.  Extra for porting your number and then a yearly fee to keep it, charges for E911 service, ect
Ads on their page and signup process constantly pushing you to buy years of service in advance
Their voicemail service is atrocious and I could never understand what someone was saying, get a real answering machine and turn the MJ one off

Overall though for a basic line service I love it and you can't beat the value.",01-23-2016

NO Monthly Bill. 2017 (1 Pack),4,5,Great for Faxing,"The only reason I've maintained a home phone line was for sending and receiving occasional faxes. I had tried Magic Jack when it first came out and didn't have good luck. Apparently they've come a long way, however. The line sounds clear and I have no trouble faxing. I'm so pleased, in fact, that I'm getting one for my business location and dropping the high priced fax line there, too.

My home network consists of a cellphone hot spot (I have unlimited data) that's connected to my wired network through a wireless bridge and a router. My upload and download speeds are around 15 megabits/second. The Magic Jack is connected to my router and no one that I've talked to can even tell that I'm no longer using my traditional landline.

My only complaint is that Magic Jack does not allow you to change the name on your account. If you get married or divorced or change your business name you're permanently stuck with whatever name you signed up with. If you're a man that's probably no big deal, but women go through a lot to change their name as they go through life and Magic Jack shouldn't be the toughest challenge.",01-20-2016

Having two phone lines and getting hosed by Verizon FIOS, I want to switch.  Verizon would not port over my number for many insane reasons so I paid twice for one line.  Finally, I moved all my services away from Verizon and put in another request to port the number, it was finally released.  My Magic Jack power supply was defective and they wanted another $5 + to ship a replacement.  Talk about ala carte .... so after over four months, it is working with my old number but the caller ID says unknown so I doubt that people will take my calls.  Magic Jack says it take 3-5 day for the Caller ID to update, we'll see.  VOIP works by itself but it's the customer service that is lacking.  Everything is done via chat sessions and everything costs extra.  I should have shopped around more before going with this firm.  Their pricing keeps going up and as long as no issues, its ok but if you have a problem, GOOD LUCK!",01-06-2016

Magicjack calls were dropping within the first minute, there was a constant buzzing on each call, and callers told me that they could hear me but I couldn't hear them. I contacted Magicjack support and unfortunately all they offer is chat window messaging to resolve issues. Tech support recommended I not use the included USB cable and connect the Magicjack directly to the power adapter. I tried this and nothing changed (why would you include a USB cable you can't use?). Magicjack offered to replace the unit, but they charge a fee to replace the defective one. I feel that I got what I paid for: a low phone bill for low quality phone service and 50% reliability. I switched from Magicjack to Ooma and the phone has been trouble-free ever since. Magicjack thanked me for being a customer by charging $32 before they would release my phone number to Ooma. I had positive experiences with the standalone Magicjack iPhone app, but the Magicjack Go is something to steer clear of.",12-19-2015

Horrible service.,"Bottom line first: Easy  set up and simple operation. Service and customer service is horrible. I had a previous line I had set up and as an aux line it did the job. I decided to set up a 2nd line for a short time. The service is not very good. Low and poor audio and line issues make it very annoying. Customer service is non existent and the reps are downright mean and condescending. They read from a script, do not answer your questions, and will not let you talk to an agent in the U.S. We were so frustrated we signed up for a decent service. Now MJ has decided to hold my phone number ransom and will not port it out. After numerous complaints and attempted bargaining with them, they will will not complete the port out process even though they said they would. To make matters worse, they now want to charge for porting out. That was never disclosed or specifically mentioned in the communication with their offshore CSRs. It was supposed to have been done over a month ago. They have received the request but still have not ported out the number. We have already complained with the BBB and are considering filing a complaint with the F.C.C and the state public utility commission. This is a miserable company to attempt to do business with and it has been a nightmare from day one. It isn't worth the headaches, one after another and the mean, uncooperative CSRs.

After about 5 weeks we are giving up on the MagicJack and going to another Voip phone service (from our cable company). We have two major problems: (1) Getting a conversation started and in sync with the caller, (2) audio breaking up.

#1 is a problem about half the time. We answer a call but there seems to be no one on the other end. Then, after 3-4 ""hellos"", we begin to hear bits of a voice and after a couple more tries we seem to get in sync with the caller and can begin a normal conversation. But sometimes the caller hangs up before that can occur, because they can't hear us either.

#2 is even more serious. After a few minutes of conversation, the caller begins to complain that they cannot understand our words. It is ""breaking up"", like a bad cell phone connection. To the point where it is impossible to continue, so we have to hang up and call back again. That restores service for a few minutes, but the problem recurs.

I don't think it is a problem with our internet or phones - we had Vonage Voip before this and it worked great. And we have good high speed cable internet. We thought to save money using MagicJack, but for us it has been unusable. We have cancelled the service and transferring our number to the Voip phone service from our cable provider.  Somewhat more expensive, but hopefully more reliable. We would have gone back to Vonage, but we got a nice price break on a bundled cable/internet/phone package from Brighthouse.

Beware and prepared!","Part !: Not happy with tech support: First, be aware that MagicJack does not offer telephone tech support, your only option is to chat with a rep. I am an EE and IT tech savy but had a very frustrating and drawn out 2 hour experience trying to get it to work and it was not my problem.

Part 2: After an hour of trying different setups, reading their one page 5""x4"" ""instructions"", rebooting PC, modem and router and and going to their site to try installing, I finally subjected myself to a ""chat"" contact. The rep said 3 or 4 times ""I am sorry for your inconvenience"" as I explained my inability to register this brand new MagicJack Go. Unable to help, she finally put me over to a higher level experienced tech who knew his stuff and understood that there was a problem. He talked me through changing several browser security settings, updating the MagicJack and a few other attempts at a fix all to no avail. He took the device's serial number and said to try it again in 2-4 hours. I asked if there was telephone # I could call to deal with this high level of support and he said sorry, no number.  3 hours later it worked. Obviously a problem with registration on their side. If you buy a MagicJack be prepared for these challenges that wasted 2 hours from my workday. I will try it for 30 days and if it continues to work will probably keep it. I just hope I never have to contact their tech support again...",09-21-2015

Make Unlimited Local & Long Distance Calls to The U. S. and Canada. NO Monthly Bill. 2017 (1 Pack),4,5,"Definitely worth it, it saves me hundreds of dollars a year.","Pretty good quality, the first thing I can tell that was different about this versus the phone service I had before (which was through my cable company) the volume was slightly lower than the cable company's. Besides that, it is exactly the same, I have the same number, the same features, the call waiting is a different sound that you might not even realize it is call waiting until it happens a few times. There is no problem with it working at all.
The MJ arrived fast, I am a Prime Member, but it took about 2 weeks for the transfer to be complete. There are additional fees to get this thing set up. It was about $5 to set up the 911 service, $10 to transfer my number, there was another $5 fee or 2, but I do not remember what it was for. But there is no way to compare this to a regular phone service because my bill for the home phone alone was over $40 a month, that was too much to pay and MJ was the answer. In total I probably paid about $75 for the first year with MJ. The device was $50 plus the other fees.
You do not need to transfer your number, you can obtain one for free with MJ, it is also a local number for your area.
If you buy this, the first year of service is included, unlimited local and long distance calling, you can buy international long distance for about $0.05 depending on the country.
To connect is very easy, the MJ plugs into a power outlet, it has 2 slots, one is to connect your phone, the other connects to your router. Thats it.",08-26-2015

The land-phone portion of my bundled phone/internet/cable service was costing me about $60/monthly - purchasing this little connector @ $37 gives me 3 months of phone service free, & I intend to then purchase 5 years  of service @ $99.95. I also paid a $10 fee to port my old phone number to Magic Jack (a number I'd had for 30 years). So Magic Jack will cost me $146.95 for 5 years & 3 months of service.  The big-name carrier I had would have cost me $3,780 for those 63 months of service. I have NO complaints!! I am using the same phone I was using before, a cordless one, & I have had no trouble with any phone calls, can hear conversation quite well, the Magic Jack window that stays open on my computer shows every phone call that comes in, every number that calls - I can click on 'Voicemail' to hear messages & save 'Contact' phone numbers.  The computer DOES need to stay ON in order for the phone to work, though it will take messages when it is off. Since I do have a cell phone also, I shut the computer down at night & turn on again each morning, just as I always did.

Make Unlimited Local & Long Distance Calls to The U. S. and Canada. NO Monthly Bill. 2017 (1 Pack),4,2,A great concept that was pushed to market before being ready.,"The magicJack GO does not work as advertised. When connected to my computer with a USB headset, it works great except I wanted to use it connected to my router and cordless phone set so I wouldn't have to leave my computer on all the time. I've found that when it is connected to my computer, the audio levels are quite acceptable. However when connected to my router and cordless phone, the earpiece volume is too low. Thinking it was my aging VTech cordless phone, I purchased a new Panasonic cordless phone set with a volume boost. The volume boost feature helped quite a bit but the earpiece volume is still too low. As an aside, my hearing is normal.

Thinking there might be a way to adjust the volume higher, I dialoged with magicJack's product support. After literally an hour an a half of having me plug it into my computer then back into the router several times, reset my router (which made no sense), make router changes that made no sense, disabling the firewall in the router, resetting the phone, change back to my VTech cordless then back, replace RJ 11 cables, and everything else other than standing on my head, magicJack support concluded that I needed to buy another router and cordless phone. I'm not going to spend $500 on a new router and yet another phone system to fix a volume problem that is obviously in the magicJack Go. It was an interesting experiment but I switched back to the telephone company so I could hear the other end (I had not cancelled my service yet).

The WiFi features of the majicJack Go need some additional development as they don't work properly and they won't ring more than one mobile device in the WiFi network. That seems a major oversight in the design. Chiefly, the problems I'm having are:

The iPhone app is buggy. If you answer a call it keeps ringing for another 30 to 40 seconds in your earpiece while you're talking to the calling party, which is very distracting.

If I answer an incoming call on my cordless phone, my iPhone just keeps ringing like the magicJack doesn't know the call was answered. That is annoying.

Caller ID transmits a time code that cordless phones can sync their clocks to. While I have a local number from magicJack, my cordless phone jumps ahead by two hours every time someone calls me. Thus, it is evident that magicJack is not accounting for time zone differences between their central office and where I live. I've found no obvious way to fix this issue other than to disable time sync in my cordless phone.

Overall, the WiFi and router connectivity features are just not well thought out and have a long way to go in development before they are useable.

Complaints aside, I'll keep it as it does work well when plugged into my computer's USB port. Since I travel internationally, it will come in handy to call home for free.

[ Edit Aug. 18, 2015 ] I encountered another disappointment. When traveling with my magicJack, I discovered that I can't use it to join conference services like GoTo meeting. When I try to join a meeting I hear a loud ticking in the earpiece. Nobody can hear me. It wasn't with just one conference call. It is with every one. I now use a Plantronic USB headset don't bother plugging in the magicJack anymore when I need to call into a conference. Here forward, I use it only to make calls home. Very disappointing.",07-05-2015

YOU GET NO MORE CHECKS OR MONEY FROM ME!,"We have been using a MagicJack for about five years now, and have not regretted it one bit. We have even had to use it to call 911 with no problem! Just sign up on the MJ web site and click the 911 service, enter your address and you are all set. Something else nice with MagicJack, you can pick your own phone number! You can even pick your own vanity phone number! This thing is great!
It was so nice to never send my phone company any more money or checks! I only pay MagicJack one fee, good for five years (cheaper that way) and never worry about it. They will send you a reminder if it is getting close to your renewal date.
The calls go through fast and sound great. Better than the phone company could ever do.
I highly recommend this phone device and I am sure you will love it too. It almost sounds too good to be true, but it is True!",06-08-2015

This is the second Magicjack I have bought over the years, and like the previous original ""as seen on TV"" USB plug-in, it fails to work properly. I was really optimistic with the ""Go"" version, now with ethernet connectivity to router. With the first generation MJ, the problem was that incoming calls went to voicemail 99% of the time when it should have rung the phone. The new model has exactly the same problem!  I went to online help chatline, and went through all the steps the MJ rep had, with no luck. His response: ""I am sorry to hear that."" Secondly, the MJ website for users is poorly designe, not intuitive at all, with inadequate FAQs and inadequate support. Add to the price, you pay extra to port your existing number ($10), and pay extra ($6 to $60 per year) for 911 service (Because, unlike true VOIP carriers like BasicTalk and Vonage, MJ doesn't include E911 fees).
Sure $35/year sounds good, but the old saying ""You get what you pay for,"" applies here.
Another thing. Read all the negative reviews. Nearly all have ""responses"" from the manufacturer, giving b.s. answers all with the ""we're sorry you're having trouble..."" PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS PRODUCT IS A SCAM, WITH HIDDEN FEES, POOR QUALITY, AND NO TRUE CUSTOMER SERVICE. BUYER BEWARE!

The yearly cost is not $19.99 a year, that is a LIE, it is more like 35.00 a year.  Your phone number when transferred to Magic Jack seems to then be out there for every one and all the sellers and Crazies to CALL YOU UP.  When it cuts off and does not work at all, there is NO ONE for you to call anywhere, for anything, or to get any help and that is really frustrating.  Their system has major phone ROUTING issues and you may have friends in certain areas that because of the routing problems, you can never call and reach them and they can not call you either.  Their voice messages have to come through your e-mail and I found those to be almost a WEEK behind the time that they were recorded.  They do not prepare you for your phone to go back to times before the STONE AGE.  I was very let down as I expected more.  I was not able to get any help even to close my account and I am still 2 months after termination getting blank Voice E-mails.  Yes, they allow you to take your number with you but you will pay for that.  Then there is a fee for 911 service.  I found it to be a disaster!  Stay away from this, it does not work as you would think.  I asked for a refund before the first month was out and I was refused any refund at all.

But he said in 5 years he only had to return one device because of defect.  He buys a new one with one year of service every year.  So he is only paying like 50 bucks a year for phone service.

Works well enough - RIP-OFF HIDDEN COST IF YOU EVER TRY TO LEAVE.,"I have had three different Magic Jacks for many years now. It's not the greatest quality, but for my limited calling, it seemed like a steal - especially compared to traditional land-lines.

There's a tiny lag, and once in a while some quality issues (I have a very fast connection, so that's not it), but as a performance to value proposition I would give it 3.5 stars.

I can no longer recommend it though. I bought an Ooma (that now follows a very similar pricing model) and I was trying to transfer my Magic Jack number to the Ooma to use as my primary line, and continue to use my Magic Jack as a secondary line. I was angry to find that Ooma charges $40 to port a number, but I was downright furious to find that MAGIC JACK CHARGES $30 TO RELEASE YOUR NUMBER. What??? So $70 total to port a number that they don't own in the first place? (doesn't the FCC technically own these numbers?)

So - this thing is a cheap telephony solution and overall worth it, just understand before you buy, that if you ever decide to go elsewhere, they're going to RIP YOU OFF to the tune of $30 more bucks. Therefore, in my mind, 2 stars is it.",04-22-2015

So I droped my expensive 50 dollar a month cell phone package and downloaded the magic app for my old cell phone and it works and for when im out of range of wifi I bought a cell phone that i only have to renew every 3 monthes. With this compleat setup my average phone bill runs about $13.00 a month. A big savings over $50.00 a month. The total package covers my compleat communications need and saves me over $35.00 a monthe and that is a big savings. Only complaint I couldent get a local excange and had to settle for one 30 miles away, makeing my number long distance for a normal land line phone! But not a problem with other phone services! Its odd that a city of 37000 dosent have a local excange!
Update decovered that when out of range of magic jack service and a message is left I get a email on my cell phone with a wave file of the message recived on the magic jack line. you then can make up your mind if you want to use preshes cell phone minets or wate until you get back in range of wifi and use Magic app. This is truley a great Tellacommunations solution and saves one a lot of money in a year. with all the features of magic jack I highly recmonend it!!!!!!",03-07-2015

It's truly a set-and-forget device, which is great as our family members are not exactly proficient in communications technology.

It's a nice little device which is *mostly* reliable: We may experienced some call drops form time to time, but it that doesn't happen very often. Actually, I didn't knock any stars because the reason for the drops may have been the internet service provider on the other side of the line.

Quit Working After 3 months - Then Free Replacement
After 3 months, no dialtone. Phone displays 'Line In Use'. Chatted with MagicJack support for about an hour running tests. They sent me a free replacement.  Then chatted with MJ support for 45 minutes to get the new device to successfully replace the old one.
I'm wondering now if my Comcast subscription contains free phone voip. If MJ fails again, I'll take a serious look at it...but if I leave magicjack I can't port my phone number that I've had since 1986!  MJ keeps the number.
Original post back in January:
I ported my existing landline to MagicJackGo because I wanted to keep my long time phone number.  I lost 2 things by switching to MagicJack but I will save about $400.00 per year).
I lost:
1. Faxing. (I only need faxing periodically but REALLY want it when I need it).
2. My alarm system could no longer dial out during a break in.
My Solution:
For $36 per year (150 secure faxes) I signed up for Sfax 'Freedom' plan.
https://www.sfaxme.com/plans-pricing/
They have other pricing plans for heavy users.  HIPAA compliant.
For my alarm system, I did this:
Called my Alarm guy to confirm this would work.
Unplugged my house phone wiring from the phone box on the outside of my house.  That's important so you don't tick off the phone co.
Plugged the output from the MagicJack into a phone line wall socket in my house.
Like before, connect your internet router to the input to the MagicJack.
Plugged my phone into a wall socket in another room of the house.
Had my alarm guy spend 4 minutes with a flat blade screwdriver to move 4 wires in my alarm system box.
Works like a champ.  When a door or window is breached the alarm system can dial out to the Central Station via MagicJack.
As anyone will warn you, MagicJack is not as reliable as a phone line when it comes to 911 calls or alarm systems....probably because MagicJack relies on an internet connection.  But in my case, I'm willing to take that risk to save $400.00 per year.
P.S.
If you decide to port your existing phone number be warned it can take up to 10 business days before you can receive incoming calls while the porting process occurs.  In my case it took about 4 days.
E911 with cost you a small fee per year. $5?
Porting an existing phone line will cost about $10.
Do NOT disconnect your phone service before porting your number to MagicJack.  Let it happen automatically through the MagicJack porting process.
To reduce the chances of losing your sacred phone number, choose auto-renewal and make sure your credit card expiration date is fresh when it gets close to MJ renewal time.  After 61 days of inability to bill you, MJ might keep your phone number.  You might lose it.",02-04-2015

Reminds me of the old adage you get what you pay for.  There are better VOIP providers which while they cost a little bit more, are much more reliable.

Make Unlimited Local & Long Distance Calls to The U. S. and Canada. NO Monthly Bill. 2017 (1 Pack),4,5,Magic Jack as Back Up Phone,"I've had MJ for about 4 years and I also have a cell phone.  I had the older model and upgraded to the newer device.

PROs
1.  I got MJ primarily to use at home to save my cell phone minutes.  When home I use MJ instead of my cell phone and never went over my minute limit.  T-Mobile now has unlimited minutes but many cell phone companies still charge by the minute.  Use your own phone - no special expensive OMA type equipment needed.

2.  99.9% of the time my MJ phone goes through.  I use my MJ to call over over the USA for ancestry research...lots of calls every day to  private cemetery managers and to local governments who manage public cemeteries and to funeral homes all over the country etc.  Only had one call not go through out of thousands of calls over the years...to some obscure small town whose funeral home I was calling and I got that recording telling me I had to use a calling card or buy minutes.  Why that tiny town had no MJ service - no idea but out of the thousand and thousands of calls I make ...hitting one glitch is no problem. I just used by cell phone for that one call.  MJ cut off Alaska a few years back because the AK telephone company jacked the rent rate on their lines up.  I use my cell phone to call friends up there so no problem.  Most people don't call Alaska anyway so it won't bother them.

3.  MJ charges around $5.00 to change the phone number so if your number is passed around to sellers or collection agencies or other bothersome people...it is cheaper and less of an inconvenience to change a MJ number than a cell phone number.  I use my MJ number if I have to type in a valid phone number and email  on those annoying on-line forms before it will allow you to ask or send an email  or punch in my MJ phone number if a company requires me to put in a number before speaking to a rep.  These types probably sell your information to others so I always give them my MJ phone not my cell phone number and my junk Yahoo email account I keep around because i know I will be spammed if I use my real email and this avoids junk calls on my cell phone and real email.

4. I haven't used it outside my house yet.  But that convenience is attractive also.

5. If you misplace your cell phone, you can still make phone calls. I don't do it often but when it happens it is a royal pain.  Use MJ to call your cell phone number and follow the ring tones to where you set down your cell phone.

6.  Much cheaper than Vonage or OMA which are a scam and expensive.  For their monthly price...you can buy a $10 a month cell phone plan and MJ and if you run into that one tiny town I tried to call years ago and couldn't get through...and you have to call them...use the cell phone.  I could get telephone service bundled with my cable/internet but MJ you can take with you when you travel and keep it when switching to a different cable/internet company since I no phone with those TV cable/internet companies. Google (Free) calls listen and record conservations and sells your phone number and information found from listening (ex you said in a phone conservation you like Toyotoas) to sellers and you will be spammed. If you are running from collection agencies...Google will sell them your phone and email in a heart beat.

CONs
1. It is a pain to reach a live human...I mostly use their chat if I have any trouble which have been small and few and far between.
2. I didn't know MJ charged to transfer a phone number if you quit MJ (seems to be an on-going dispute if this is true or not or legal or not from reading the other comments) I do not care if I lose the phone number.  I treat my MJ phone number like my junk yahoo email.  It is my cell phone number and main email account that I care about.",01-15-2015

It is a perfect product I keep buying and installing for my relatives and recommending to my friends.
Sound quality when used with decent cordless phone is very good. Tone commands are working perfectly.
Physical connecting is very easy.

Registration is easy with one minor caveat:
registering new MagicJack gadget do not pick any optional service which costs money. Pick only free vanilla service - no 911 feature, no number transfer feature, no additional minutes or additional years feature.

It will allow you to register gadget in 1 minute without any help. Otherwise you might stuck on faulty payment page and will need help of the support team.
You will be able to add/purchase any feature any moment AFTER gadget is registered.

It is very convenient that location you had register this gadget does not matter. You can register it in one location, disconnect it and then plug it into a router (Ethernet) in another location. It will just work.

With this purchase I had discovered that it is easy to have multiple gadgets tied to one MajicJack login and e-mail. And I was able to port number registered to a different name/address from the ""real"" phone company. I just requested porting and when porting had failed as expected in couple hours, I got an e-mail notification from MagicJack. That notification asked me to clarify the name/address and some other info tied to the current owner of the phone number. I entered all information and re-requested porting. And it worked this time.",12-30-2014

Why, you ask, would I buy a new unit when the old one has 6 months to go on a 1 year renewal with a warranty included?  Trust me!  By the time MJ charges shipping and handling, administrative fees and anything else they can manage to tack on for sending me a replacement unit and I send the old one back to them, the price of 6 months service pales by comparison.  Not to mention the fact that they may not ship a replacement to me for months.  Then why not try a different service instead of buying new?  MJ is a low cost, mostly dependable service for my needs and possibly yours.  This way I have a brand new unit with one year of service included.  You only have to remember the following:
1.)  Don't depend on MJ as your primary phone source (mine is OOMA and I use MJ as a dedicated FAX line.)  Yes, it works fine with faxes.
2.)  Never, and I emphasize NEVER, try to contact their so called customer service.  You will reach India or God knows where and the only
  English spoken will be from the written cue cards in front of the person reached.  Did I fail to mention that this is a CHATROOM only?  There
  is no way you can actually speak to a person - not that they would understand you anyway.  Someone wrote in a review that this is the
  worst customer service on earth.  The person forgot to include the Moon and the southern hemisphere of Mars.
Yes, MagicJack is a good phone service if you remember the above.  I'm sure it is great for someone who travels a lot with a laptop and wants to be able to talk to home without the expense of long distance.  It would work also as a backup for your primary phone should something happen to it.  Just don't depend on it as your only means of communication.
I doubt very much that MJ will respond to this review as there is nothing in their scripted replies to really cover what I have written.
MJ is a good service with reservations and MJ GO is my third MJ device.  The original was useless.  That is why I have OOMA as a primary phone service.  MagicJack Plus worked very well as a dedicated fax line until it died.  I hope MJ GO is even better and lasts longer than 2 1/2 years before I have to buy unit #4.",12-15-2014

And it sends tone signals/codes flawlessly (there used to be complains about this feature).

Setting up a MajicJack account (if you do not have any yet) is a required part of the setup.

I had one problem during installation, but this is actually a plus to the MajicJack support (thanks guys):
When I had tried to setup my MajicJack with additional optional 911 paid service (and bill/reminder e-mail came to my email box), setup process kept crashing at processing credit card step. I had tried to give credit card info, but it kept crashing anyway.

The solution found by MajicJack support was to reject optional paid services (911, prepaid minuted, additional year, etc.) during account setup.

You would have plenty of opportunities to add these new options and features online after account would be setup and device would start working.",09-30-2014

Now I can say nice things about this product. Bay 15, the seller, was very slow to ship. The product was moderately a pain to install, some of the pull down choices wouldn't ""take"", like area code and exchange choices, 911 settings. I had to go back and forth entering one choice at a time. The ""re-up"" default was to buy the 5 year plan for $120 bucks and it took a while to get that to go away. I never was able to get the 911 settings right on the install screen, but was able to fix them later when Magic Jack sent me a bill for a year's worth of 911 fees (under $5).  Once installed the product works great. I plugged it into my Panasonic wireless phone system and it works fine. The called ID works fine.  Now I can't wait to get rid of my $50 a month (plus taxes, fees, surcharges etc etc) land line from Verizon.

Cons:
Very disappointed that the printer consumes a lot of ink. I can't afford to spend this much on ink. I don't print a lot but scanned quite a few documents. Maybe there's a software glitch that indicates low ink levels when it can keep printing more pages. I suspect that running diagnostics and printing alignment pages, cleaning printer head takes a heavy toll on the ink cartridges. Will see how it goes and update this review later.

I keep anticipating that the rollers will fail in the paper feed mechanism, but it keeps on working???  It's an HP; it can NOT work forever.

So, after I received the new HP Envy 4500, I assembled it and loaded the set up software which promptly connected my laptop to HP's website and downloaded then installed all the required software. Everything worked fine, it did a new cartridge alignment and then I printed a few pages; made a few copies; scanned a few documents and generally assured myself that it was working properly.  I then packed it up and put it back in its box.  I'll wait until my 2512 fails; which could be a few days or weeks or even months???  Then I'll start using the new 4500.  I will update this review after I put the 4500 into use.  I use a wired connection, a cable did not come with the new printer.",10-31-2016

The scanner works great, the ink cartridges are easy to replace, the main compartment is big enough for you to easily fix paper jams (which rarely happen -- I just forget to open the paper tray sometimes) and you can close up the paper tray to reduce how much space it takes up. The ink isn't too expensive, and the printer itself is QUIET!! The two-sided feature still prints pretty quickly, and the menu screen is very easy to navigate -- it has enough buttons for navigation and wireless network setup to not be a total pain.

The only thing - included CD wasn't readable on my PC (read errors). Had to download installer from HP website. Prints quietly and quickly. Scans very fast. Good quality print and scan.
One feature that I miss - my old HP would 'wake up' if I print something; this one doesn't - have to manually power it on when I want to print. I guess not much progress since 2004.
Did not try Wi-Fi printing. There was NO USB cable included with it. Back in 2004 there was.

Note that in my box I discovered: Printer, HP ink 61 Black and color (2 inks), USB CORD, ONE PIECE ELECTRICAL CORD, quick instructions with pictures, owners book and other HP info. For months, I hinted to a close friend how much I wanted this printer to use to print from my Android phone and Android tablets...I received this as a gift and I now print from my phone and tablets and U tell uou how below...

For 3 months now, I have owned this printer and it has exceeded my expectations!

*****Below, I share how I set it up wirelessly as I use it on my HP Desktop with Windows 7, HP Laptop with Windows 8.1 and most importantly, I print now on my Samsung J1 Android Lollipop Smartphone, Samsung Tab 3 tablet with KitKat 4.4, Samsung Tab A with Lollipop.

1 Installing/Setup...I took my time and first, I installed both inks, plugged it in (did not plug in USB because I wanted to use it wirelessly on SEVERAL MOBILE DEVICES and also on 2 local home computers, turned on and BEFORE I put in the CD, I installed wirelessly next to my router and the printer found my router, then I typed in my password on my router and followed the instructions step by step.
In about 5 minutes my printer was installed.
Then I put the CD that came with the printer in and installed the HP software and my computer printed a file beautifully.

How I printed on my Android phone and Android tablets...
1 I went to the Playstore and installed the free HP ePrint, also PrinterShare (free one).
2 HP .... I just signed up for free account and placed in a code for each device then I was able to print pictures, documents and more. Both the HP ePrint and PrinterShare worked perfectly. Also, I installed Cloud Print app.
3 I tested distance with this by bringing my phone outside in my front yard....it printed great.

Pros of this printer:

1 Prints from my phone, tablets and 2 computers wirelessly.
2 HP includes a FREE USB cable it was in my box, and also ink is included.
3 Print quality...Better than I expected. Very clear, pictures vivid, text is clear.
4 Scanning ... Exceptional, easy to use software on my computers.
5  Very Quiet...My last printer was loud, this one is so quiet, I can hardly hear it even right next to it.
6 Fairly compact and easy to carry around...it fits great on a small table next to my desk.
7 Easy to load ink cartridges, easy to load paper.
8 So far no paper jams whatsoever!
9 BEST PRO IS...Just 30 minutes it took me to totally install 2 ways (see above).
I installed just on printer first before I put tbe CD in my computer and installed software there.
10 Quality printer with both wireless and ePrint (for mobile devices).
11 Uses dual HP ink 61 (COLOR AND BLACK SET). I just use genuine HP ink, cost will be about 39 to 40 dollars. I usually go 3 to 4 months on ink before I have to purchase more.

Just one CON:

The ink does not last as long as I like, however, I have printed my share of files and a few photos, most were in color. Yet after 3 months use, I still have about 40 percent ink remaining. So it is time to order more of 61 ink color and black set in box from Amazon very soon...

Since this was a gift from my best friend, it was a meaningful gift. If she had not purchased this, I would have ordered it from Amazon because it was a printer that I had my eye on for months.

Highly recommend this printer!",12-31-2015

Highly recommended for those looking for a personal printer for light-duty tasks.  This is not a high volume printer.

Update:  The scan function works great.  When you scan from the unit, it sends the image to a folder called ""Scanned Documents"" within your Windows documents folder.  At least, this is how it works on Windows 8.1 Pro.  I have not tried scanning to my Windows 10 laptop yet, but likely, the same folder will be created in the same location.  When you start the scan, it will ask you to confirm the destination.  You will be presented with the 'computer names' of the workstations on your network.  Select which computer you want to send the scan image to.  That is all there is to it.  This is convenient when your workstation is far away from the HP 4500.",10-21-2015

It's reasonably fast, good text and photo quality, and the automatic duplex printing feature works well and is very handy.  Of course it lacks some features of more expensive printers (no fax capability, no document feeder, no multiple paper trays, etc.), but as a basic printer/scanner/copier it gets the job done.  The only disappointment so far is that there's no convenient one-click ability to print b/w or grayscale.  You can remove the color cartridge and the printer will recognize and work in a ""single cartridge"" mode, but that's a hassle.

Great Printer! Great Pages! And Guilt Free!,"I absolutely LOVE this printer. It is very easy to use, (as demonstrated by my 88 year old luddite mother who lives with me and used it to scan, copy and print without having to refer to the manual!) and delivers high quality, FAST! printing at a very reasonable price.(I just now finished printing an 8x10 photo to frame as a gift and it didn't take very long at all.)  It fits neatly into a rather small space. Ordering ink is as simple as clicking a button. When you are low on ink you get a message which will direct you to the HP website to purchase ink for your printer. If you do a lot of printing or own a small business, you can sign up for HP's ""Instant Ink"" and based on an estimate of how many pages you print each month HP will send your ink out on a schedule. This is a great money saving way to get your ink. Lastly, Hewlett Packard has the second highest rating on the Raise hope for Congo website as being an industry leader in the fight against using conflict minerals so I can feel good about purchasing HP products. The conflict minerals thing is very important to me, so when I purchase any electronics that might use these minerals I do a great deal of research before purchasing so that I am sure not to contribute any more than I absolutely must to the decades long civil war and all of it's ravages in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Furthermore, I've been using HP products since my first computer back in the '90's and I've been very pleased with them. I know that there are better computers out there, but Intel is the only product which rates higher in terms of the conflict minerals thing.",10-02-2015

The first problem: When you print a two-sided document you get a pop-up message that says ""Ink is drying."" Fine. Physics. The ink has to dry a little before printing the 2nd side of the page. The problem was, if you print a 40 page document you would get the pop-up 40 times!  And each time it would throw you out of whatever you were doing. You had to click ""dismiss"" or you could wait a few seconds and it would dismiss itself. It took an internet search and finally a call to tech support where they guided me through the arcane process of turning that alert off.

The second and fatal problem: the scanner function broke. It simply dropped dead between one day and the next. When you insert a new cartridge it wants to print and scan an alignment page. That is now impossible. However, it keeps trying, hanging up the last remaining function which is to print.

If you care about looks and presentation, this printer is pretty adequate, if not pleasing.  Being black, it fits in anywhere, and while the control panel along its center is a less attractive glossy finish (finger prints!), the sides, bottom-front, and top are an attractive flat matte black finish that gives a nicer touch.  It's also small enough to fit on most desks if need be.

And it performs great.  It prints fast, the quality is good, and replacing cartridges is easy.

Overall it delivers a handful of improvements over my previous Cannon model.  Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend.

Edit (Oct. 5, 2015):  While I'm still happy w/this printer,  I've docked 2 stars b/c of a horrible whine it's developed when powered on.  It just started a couple weeks ago.  It's very noticeable, even with video/sound playing at low to moderate volume levels; it just pierces through everything else.  This is doubly annoying for me as I go to great lengths to ensure my work environment is quiet.  But even for those that aren't silence freaks, the whine is still a tarnish on an otherwise remarkable printer.

Edit (Jan 22, 2016):  Another issue I've noticed over the past few weeks ... if you're on Linux, you may find that you have to power cycle the printer before it prints.  E.g. when printing, a print dialogue clearly recognizes the printer, but after clicking Print, nothing happens.  Until I turn off the printer, then turn it back on.  Then it prints.  Pretty annoying.  I've docked another star.

Edit (Dec 30, 2016):  Regarding my Jan 22 edit, I've found that upgrading to Linux Mint 18 resolves the issue of needing to power cycle the printer in order for it to pick up on new printing jobs.  Replacing one star, so back up to a 3-star rating.",09-03-2015

Great size for a student or office without the room for a full size Officejet. All you really sacrifice the ability to FAX, which you can do via online services if you need to.

Printer is easy to set up. Use the included disc if you're not familiar with how to download the drivers yourself. No problem connecting it to our wifi. Our HP tablets print on these directly, though you can use HP's free service to print with other devices.

Print quality is very good. Paper capacity is a bit lacking for an office printer, but it's not an Officejet, so no foul there. I normally refill our empty ink cartridges, but this is one printer where I use HP Instant Ink service. You receive very large ink cartridges, much larger than the standard or XL versions. The plan saves us about 50% compared to buying XL cartridges retail. No fuss. No mess. No confused employees with popups that they have recycled cartridges installed (if I refill them).

If you need a full function printer in an office setting, I'd suggest and Officejet printer instead. This is a nice, small printer, which doesn't take up much room. Very low profile. Without a built in print head, should be worry free for a long time. And... it looks pretty sleek too.",08-22-2015

I purchased this printer so replace my Lexmark which had died after several years. I always had problems with the Lexmark software so I thought I'd give HP a try.

SLOW: It literally took 6 minutes 35 seconds to print a single full color picture on plain paper. I set it for best quality and borderless. Even trying to print simple graphics with only black ink is painful.

Ink quality is sub par at best. Printing in only black in and glossy paper gives the ink a dark grey/faded black look. If I set it to print using all colors I get an almost rainbow effect in the prints. I have tried every setting I can think of and just can't get a good quality print on specialty paper. Even one of the prints I did using all inks I noticed has started to spread and looks like crap.

I will be looking for another printer soon. This one was $49.99 when I bought it and two days later it went up $20 and then down $9 so if you feel like taking a chance. Keep an eye on the price.",08-02-2015

I researched several models with the features that I wanted such as automatic duplexing and fast printing speed and this was by far the best price and highest rated.  No jams thus far and it is sleek and compact. It sits directly behind my desk on a small bookshelf. I made one attempt to connect it to a wireless network but it did not connect. However, I am 99 % sure that it had something to do with my school's network and not the printer since I own a similar model at home and had no issues with wireless setup.  I connected it via USB and it worked great. No software needed to be installed as my desktop recognized it immediately.  To me the cartridges are pricey since I got spoiled purchasing knock off brands for my old printer. The HP knock offs have poor reviews on Amazon but this site has pretty good prices for the authentic 61 cartridge combo pack.

I'll start with the pros:
1. It's well priced compared to other printers that do basically the same thing
2. This printer does amazing double sided printing and it even flips the page for you so there's no more having to print only even numbered pages, flip the paper and print the odd sheets. It does it automatically which is very nice
3. This printer will save you a lot of money in the long run because it qualifies for the HP Instant Ink Program which works as follows. You pay a monthly fee ranging from 2.99 to 3.99 and as long as you stay within your allotted number of pages HP will send you a new ink cartridge as soon as your printer starts to run low. If you print a lot of photographs it can get expensive. I have the 10 dollar plan, which lets me print up to 300 pages a month and no matter how many times I run out of ink in that month, I will keep getting ink cartridges sent to me in the mail so long as I don't print over 300 pages. Some months I have gotten upwards of 90 dollars worth in ink cartridges and still only pay 10 dollars a month.

Now getting to the cons
1. This printer is constantly having me update the IP address. I have connectivity issues with this printer where the printer will be offline and won't print even though I've set it up wirelessly. I am constantly having to go through the printer set up, sometimes multiple times a day.
2. The double sided printing is amazing but it can be sooo slow. I once tried to print out a 200 page double sides document and it took over 7 hours to do it. All the while I couldn't use my printer because I had it connected by USB and not the wireless.
The wireless connection is really, really touchy and if anything goes wrong with the signal, the printer will stop and you'll have to try to start the print job where it left off or start all over.

Over all, it's a good deal but be prepared for some stressful malfunctions with the wireless connectivity and don't print any large double sided files last minute because it can be mind numbingly slow and if you've got a deadline, it's better to do it way in advance.",07-27-2015

Thankfully the Envy does not disappoint and I'm very pleased with this printer.  I prefer this one to my prior printer for a number of reasons.  This one is a little more compact, so it takes up less room on my desk.  The printing tray can be pulled out for larger size paper, but for normal printing it doesn't come out nearly as far as my other printer does which is nice because I hated having that part hang off the desk.

This was super easy to set up, I was able to set up the wireless on the printer and my computer in a matter of minutes.  I also like that it only requires two ink cartridges. I've had other printers where it took up to 5 cartridges and this gets very expensive.  I'm also always able to find much better deals on HP Ink.  You can choose to set up ink delivery through HP but I chose to pass on that at this time.

The printing quality is great for both regular printing and photos.  It also scans very well and overall I'm once again incredibly pleased with this HP printer.

Aside from the staples needed to be ""crafty"", what has become indispensable is a good printer. I've had and used quite a few over the years, some good, some bad, one or two truly awesome. But when I got a chance to try a honest to goodness ""All-in-One"" printer, I was giddy. One that prints, copies, scan, and prints pictures. And, as a cherry on top, it will do it wirelessly. HP's Envy 4500 boasts all these features and more. And while it does most everything you ask of it quickly, painlessly, and with quality, there were some hiccups I would be remiss if I didn't highlight as well.

This HP Envy 4500 is prints quickly,up to 21ppm speed, and has sharp, crisp blacks. And the bright, vivid colors, pops on all types of papers, especially genuine HP photo paper. But, this HP Envy also wants to save you time by offering 2-sided printing! Oh, huzzah! No more waiting for a document to reinsert and then hope and pray you guessed the correct orientation. I'm also loving the photo printing, because there's nothing worse than sorting through page after page of clip art, finding that one gem, and seeing it printed like it's a lousy dot-matrix printer from the 80's and all the detail is LOST. That isn't how the HP Envy 4500 rolls. And I haven't even got to the best part. Wireless printing.

Be it from your laptop, your tablet, or your smartphone, everything you need to print, you can in a snap. Once you connect the printer to your home network, you're golden. Your 100 page tray is you're only limitation, because the work can be printed from your fingertips. And with a one-year warranty, and 24/7 tech support just a phone call away, you know HP has your back.

Now, I must mention the hiccups. This is my third HP printer. Every HP product I've ever owned has been rock solid in their build, and this one is really no exception. The chink in the armor with HP's software. It's always been a little buggy, for as long as I've owned HP products, and this software is no exception. And, most frustratingly, is the constant ""pop-up"" asking me to sign up to HP's ink cartridge subscription program. No means no, people. But once you get past that, you get to the quick printing, the colors that pop, and the privilege of not having to drag your devices across the house to print anything and everything. To scan documents and upload them from three rooms away. There's a lot to like about this printer, and I'm happy I got to try it.

08/07/2015 Edit: An addendum to this review previously posted on July 22nd, is that the software seems to be somewhat corrupted, or very faulty (It's been uninstalled and reinstalled now thrice!). It loses it's wireless connection almost every day and jams fairly frequently now too. It's also quite the ink hog, as I'm already being told to replace the black ink cartridge not even a month after purchase (No, not the ""starter ink"" it came with, either). I recant my previous recommendation because really, it isn't doing any of the things it's supposed to do very well. When it does print, it's gorgeous. But no one wants a crap shoot when they click ""print"". You want to know it's going to work the first time, every time.

It's super sleek and fits nicely on top of my computer hutch. I was afraid it might be too bulky but it is not.

I also like the fact that this is a 2 ink cartridge printer.  My last one was 5! Saving money right there but I recommend buying non oem ink as it works just as well and at a fraction of the cost.

I specifically wanted two sided printing abilities and the ability to print with only a single cartidge in (bc I know it'll eat through ink faster if you put both in).  It works fine, but duplex printing is a little slow...although it's not a big deal since I'm normally doing something else while I print.

My real issue with it is changing the cartridges and the electrical cord.  The first time I changed the ink it kept giving error messages.  After and hr of screwing with it I finally learned that even though it says aligning a new cartidge is optional, it's not.  You MUST aligned when putting in new cartridges.  The problem with the power cord is that it can curl back into an opening in the back of the printer and keep the paper tray from fitting back in correctly or it tears the paper when you print which then catches inside the printer and jams it.

Make no mistake about that. It prints slow, but gets the job done. The Auto Duplex feature is nice, but I never heard of a printer that needs to wait for the ink to dry to turn over the page to print.
Set up is fairly straightforward and simple enough for the most part. I went with the web set up option basically because I don't want HP's software on my computers, bothering me to buy this and that. I use this primarily on my Chromebook and Android smartphones - though I did set it up on two of my Windows 7 Laptops. Wireless direct must be turned on in order to connect one's mobile devices. Just scan down from the main page on the printer and you will see Wireless Direct. Default is off. You must turn that feature on if you want to print from your android smartphone or tablet. I read that in the manual. Also, I had to go to Google's web page on ""Google Ready Cloud Printers"" to complete the last step to enable my Chromebook to print. It was simple enough, but the printer left out that important last step. A third thing that bothers me is that this printer has no memory. Because of this, whenever I switch my wireless connection, the printer forgets the password I previosly entered and I have to enter the password again. This is not a factor if you only have one wireless connection at home. But I use three mobile hotspots with three different passwords and I am entering a different password every day brcause this printer has no memory. Needless to say, I keep this printer right next to my chromebook and mobile hotspots.
I already have a very fast laser printer for big businesd jobs. I bought this printer primarily for my Chromebook so I don't have to go downstairs to print a page or two while I am on my Chromebook. I would never use this printer for business. For casual home use, it is fine.

It isn't for people looking to print high quality photos. Definitely go with a Canon if you're looking for amazing images. Be forewarned, this printer prints in dots.

Overall though, for what I use it for, printing photos for simple school projects, it's not bad. The black ink seems to run out a bit too quickly though--this may be because of how I use it, but still. It runs out faster than my other printers at home, so I'm guessing ink storage capability isn't too great.

Arrived promptly and well packaged. Seems quieter than expected from reviews.

The Bad Part
Initial setup instructions not clearly labeled a bit too succinct; I could have used clearer directives and better labeling; had to presume a bit more than comfortable, though apparently guessed correctly.

Software setup lackedg sufficient step identifiers to ascertain where one was in the setup routine; there was never an indication that it was completed. Lacking photographic memory of previous screens, I eventually simply abandoned the seemingly redundant, cyclical routine and checked my printer options, fortunately I found the printer available, and it printed. So far so good.

HP really should have tested the setup and provided clear indicators of the steps and completion thereof.

Inexcusable. The URL provided for online access to setup without a CD drive was a dead end and required searching for the setup procedure on the HP web site. Not difficult to find, but, then, not difficult to provide a link via their published URL either. Seemed needless customer aggravation.

Good printer / scan doesn't work / tiny ink cartridges","We won this printer at a ""Dirty Santa"" Christmas party, so that's exciting. Free is always exciting. We've been using it for a few months now. I love that I can open a pdf or Word file on my phone, and I can print it upstairs! It's all wireless and done through my Wifi network. The printer is really quiet, and it prints at a good speed. I really like the looks of it. I have a dark wood desk, and you almost forget this black printer is there because it's really low profile. I would guess it's around 6-7"" tall. The printer never disconnects from our U-verse network, and it responds pretty quickly when a print request is sent. The ink cartridge doesn't last as long as some printers I've owned.

ISSUE #1: I tried to scan a sheet of paper to email it to someone. I put the sheet on the scanner, opened the printer program, and started a scan. The scanner just kept saying ""Scanning..."" with a little rolling bar. It was taking forever, so we just left to eat at a restaurant. When I came home, the scanner still said ""Scanning..."" just like when I left, and the computer was in sleep mode. When I hit ""Cancel"", it started saying ""Canceling..."" forever, until I turned the printer off. That happened when I selected the scan as a document and a .jpeg picture. It repeated that problem whether I initiated a scan through the computer or the printer itself.

ISSUE #2: I decided to contact HP to ask for help on why my scanner wasn't working. I looked around their FAQ's on their website, and the website was cumbersome with little useful information. I decided to contact HP for help. When I wrote out the issues I was having (explained in Issue #1), I went to submit the contact form. The website asked me to prove I was still under warranty with a proof of purchase or other means. I couldn't even send a contact form! Like I said earlier, it was a gift, and apparently my warranty is up after 1 year. I thought HP was a name brand, and that would mean something. I have to say HP's customer support is non-existent.

Update 03/18/15:
We replaced our first ink cartridge today. You install the ink cartridge, and it has to print a test page. Then you have to put the test print page on the scanner to let it scan the page for alignment purposes. Well, guess what... The scanner isn't working as I said earlier in this review, so the alignment isn't working right. This printer is truly a POS. I am downgrading this review from 2 stars to 1 star, and I'm going to swap back to my old printer. Thank goodness I kept it.",03-07-2015

The Envy setup was easy, and the print quality is just fine.  Minor downsides to it include the monochrome menu screen, which uses symbols to tell you when the ink cartridges are running low instead of just saying the color cartridge, for example, is running low.  So, does the bow tie or the circle represent the color cartridge?  Not a big deal, just a poor design decision.  Also, you must remove all paper from the tray to print an envelope or different size picture.

My biggest concern, by far, is that this machine eats print cartridges for breakfast.  I buy the XL cartridges because they are supposed to have 3x the ink.  Yet, these run out FAR faster than my old 5280 XL cartridges ever did.  I print maybe a page or two a day on average (so pretty little), and I'm on my 3rd set of cartridges in the 3 months since I got the printer.  The reviews said it used lots of ink, but I liked previous HPs and didn't believe the reviews.  My mistake.  I would never buy this printer again, just because of the ink (a set of cartridges can cost $75 minimum on Amazon, and retail for $170).  Vote with your dollars and buy some other printer to let HP know this is unacceptable.",02-13-2015

Very poor packaging idea and has potential for damage en-route. Once opened you find the product box very neat as if it came off the shelf at your local office max. The driver and program disk loaded quite easily and the device set up was complete in 10 minutes - too easy. All my devices recognize the printer and print well, however the color setting may be off a little since my prints do not completely match what is on the computer or device display screen. Word type documents and scanning are very good. It does seem that with all my HP printers that I have used in the past, and including this one, they all make a lot of noise and jerky sounds as the mechanisms work inside. The sounds are a minor issue since the printer works, but it still sounds like something is gonna break from the hard sounds. I like this printer for the ease and simple operation. I also enjoy how this printer is also smaller than most and lower profile so it doesn't take up a lot of space which can be used for more important things.

It is part of this high tech revolution that is coming to ordinary households. I have an IPhone and an IPad and have never been able to Air print before even though my last printer claimed to do this. The HP 4500 printer is a marvel of technology. I am able to print anywhere using my iPhone or iPad wirelessly. I am not very tech savvy and I get frustrated whenever I have to set up a system but setting up the HP 4500 with its built in wifi was almost automatic. I plugged it in and it almost set it up itself. Because it has its own wifi capability, it shows up as an access point itself. And the greatest magic I like is when I go to print a web page or document on line, it asks if I want to print two sides. My gosh two sided printing automatically is a wonder to me. Saves so much paper. Another feature is the service HP offers for printer cartridges. Because I print so few pages a month and cartridges are so expensive I sighed up for their auto PC (printer cartridges) service that sends out either color or Bw PC when ever the printer tells HP I need a new PC automatically. They have levels of use at cost per month. I pay $2.99 per month and the PC are sent out in auto mode. They provide a envelope to send back depleted PCs. This is a great service when you figure the cost of PCs. I highly recommend this printer.",01-05-2015

I usually only leave good reviews, but this has been one of the most frustrating doorstops I have ever purchased. What was HP thinking???

UPDATE: We hardwired it. NOW it works well!  I am no longer frustrated, but it is no longer wireless. Kind of missed the point there. Don't try to print on anything thicker than typing paper. IT WILL JAM.  I have to print a page, then then it down to the kids' printer (our ""old"" one) to make copies on card stock.  NOT the thick kind, either. Just a light card stock. This is STILL the most temperamental printer I have had from HP. Good gravy!

MORE UPDATE: Why do I try to keep this thing clumping along?  Now it actually ROLLS the printed page out 1 out of 3 tries.  Yes, it takes approximately 3 tries to get one page out without it jamming up. Just one-sided, normal copies.  Nothing fancy.  Clearly this machine is not supposed to last long.  You can see, I have certainly given it a good try!  I am stubborn and determined to keep this limping along, but if I end up wasting too much paper in the long run, it won't be worth it. At this point, I just want to get my (new) ink's worth out of it!!!  Dumb me, for putting in new ink.",10-18-2014

I have been going nuts over printers as they all have give and take. I purchased this because my printer just stopped period and I needed one in a flash. Said I would never buy another HP but I did. The reason I purchased this is because consumer reports (which I don't normally listen to) said the maintenance ink use was good. I think that also helps drain the ink. I think all the inkjets use a lot of ink that is why I got this one. I know it only has two ink cartridges, one for color and one for black but i have found that when you have four or 5 ink tanks they all seem to empty pretty close to the same time so with the two at least I am not out an arm and leg. For me I found the 4500 and the 5530 not much difference to warrant paying any more than I have to. It is very basic and boring but it does what I want. Print, copy, scan and wireless to laptop and hard wire desktop. I liked the Canon MG5530 but that is LOUD and always rumbles and making noises. At least this is quiet until you print. I have printed, scanned, printed pic. Don't know about phones or i pads etc. When I need to learn that I will but don't have an i pad. Before this I had a photosmart and it had 2 ink cartridges and the black lasted about 5 months and color longer but it was a good machine when it wanted to work. I bought the cheaper model also because if I didn't like it and I only got a year out of it I wouldn't be out a lot of money. Hope I made some sense. It does look nice being all black. It doesn't have the touch screen but that is not a problem for me.
UPDATE 10/8/14 After trying more features out I find the photos are not very good. Picture of flower and dog seemed ok but people do not turn out well at all as they are washed out. I will just take them to Walgreen's for photos and not waste my time or ink. As far as regular day to day stuff it seems fine.

You have to be careful when you install the printer software. If you acquiesce to the defaults, you'l get all sorts of ink-sucking ""features,"" like a service that will automatically print off 10 pages of news headlines every day, ""for your convenience.""  Who would want that?  HP would want it, because it's going to burn through a lot of ink!  Likewise there are all kinds of games and puzzles -- printed of course -- that you can get, FREE!  You can have a crossword puzzle printed out for you every day!  Think of all the black ink that will use.  This printer is designed to sell ink -- keep that in mind.

When you do install a new ink cartridge -- and it better be genuine HP -- the printer will automatically print an elaborate, multi-colored ""test page"" that you then have to scan ""for accuracy.""  There may be some technical rationale for this, but it certainly is yet anothe ink sucker.

Then there's the spam.  Every few days you get an unsolicited, large HP notice on top of your work (that is a definition of malware right there -- HP basically installs a virus in your computer under the guise of ""service."")  The notice invites you to buy more ink from HP (at a high price) and to claim your ""rewards"" for using HP ink -- these rewards are ink-hungry, multi-colored coupons you can print out, yes, print out. The discount coupons are for meaningless products that have nothing to do with anything; they're pure ink-suckers.

You can disable most of these HP viruses by going to C:\Program Files\HP\HP ENVY 4500 series\Bin\  and renaming the files HPRewards.exe and HPSmartDeals.exe. Just put an 'x' at the front of the file names. You'll need administrator privileges.

There are also some accidentally-on-purpose design flaws in the software calculated to suck ink. For example, if you change the ""Number of copies"" on the printer panel, say to 8, then whenever you use the ""Quick Print"" function in Windows after that, you get 8 copies of everything.  Ooops!  Accident or diabolical scheme? You can correct the situation by using the File/Print menu and setting the number of copies to 1, but until you discover this little trick, you're going to burn some ink.

On the plus side, it's a small, attractive printer that prints, scans, and copies flawlessly.  It's wireless, which frees up a precious USB port on the computer (although the printer can also be run on a USB cable if you have wireless problems).  If you have strong Wifi coverage, there is no problem in wireless mode. It's a bit of a challenge, but not too difficult to enter the network SSID and WEP code into the printer's front panel.

With the right HP software app, you can also print directly from your phone. I haven't done photo printing  (who prints photos anymore?).  Another plus is that the ink, #61, is slightly cheaper than the ink for other printers (The XL size black being about $25 at Costco).

The printer only holds 100 sheets of paper at a time. Double that would be better, but actually, I think most people print a lot less than they used to. Printers may soon become obsolete.  One more strong plus: it prints 2-sided copies automatically and flawlessly. No re-loading the paper to get the second side. Just choose 2-sided and like magic...a wonderful feature. Over all, I'm happy with the printer; very unhappy with HP for its deceitful and greedy marketing practices.",07-25-2014

When it works, it works really well.  I loved the scanning feature until it wouldn't send it wirelessly to my laptop anymore (and I had used it earlier in the day for the same thing, so the frustration factor was pretty big that night).  I needed it to print one page of text 2 nights ago and I needed it the next day.  After 45 minutes of removing the device from my laptop, reinstalling it, resetting our router, manually putting in codes and other junk (my husband was finally trying his hand at it after listening to my voice get louder and louder), actually hooking up the usb cable to the printer (which also didn't work), I wanted to toss the thing through the window and jump up and down on it.  Ok, that was more of a vent than a review, but thanks for letting me get it all out.

I'm using it on a Dell with Windows 8.  I am using the Intek refillable cartridge system, which I find has worked very well.

Today I finally had time to sit down and try to figure out why it won't send a print job from the laptop to the printer with our wireless.  I did some Google searching and came up with the HP Print and Scan Doctor.  I tried that out, and it fixed both the printing and scanning issues.  All of my drivers are current and correctly installed (or so the scans tell me).  So a thumbs up for HP Print and Scan Doctor.

HOWEVER, when I sent my 5 page print job to the printer, it did it's nice little trick of only printing 2 pages and about 1.5"" of the third page before it spit it out and wouldn't print the rest of the pages.  It has done this from the start (even before I was using the refill cartridge option, so it isn't that) so I have to only submit 2-3 pages at a time because apparently it gets confused with more pages.  I cannot find a resolution to this problem with any searching and apparently my warranty is over and HP won't let me email them about this problem--which is what prompted me to come over here and tell others about my experience with this printer.

Our router is relatively new and we have a great internet connection so I do not believe it is the wireless in our house.  We do not have issues with other devices and we have upgraded routers and internet speeds regularly over the years to keep things running smoothly in our house.  This is the only issue we have that bouncing the router doesn't resolve.  And the problems can happen between print jobs that are back-to-back!

My opinion is buyer beware.  If you plan on hooking this up to a computer with a USB cable connection rather than wireless, I think it is a very cheap option that would work well for you.  I do NOT recommend it with a wireless connection to the printer unless you have loads of free time and you don't need printed pages on a deadline.  And buy the Inktec refillable cartridges from here because you might be wasting a lot of ink on partially printed pages.  If you do buy it with the intention of using it with the USB cable, make sure that you have the driver installed with the USB option and you are using that driver to print.

Ease of installation - super easy, didn't even need any CD. Once printer was installed on wi-fi it is easily detected by every computer (both Windows & Mac), iPhone and iPad alike. Once detected, printing is a matter of one click.

Alignment: May need to do it 2-3 times depending on your surface leveling and how often you move it around.

Print speed: Decent as expected from an inkjet.

Noise: A bit loud, but if it is located in home-office, should not be an issue.

Scan & copy : works well for standard letter size papers. Settings may need some tweaking with contrast.

Size: Small footprint and tray does not take too much outer space when opened. Can be well supported in the printer foot print itself.

Ink Usage: Can't comment yet as i have not done excessive printing at home.

ePrint option: superb feature where you can setup an email address for the printer from HP ePrint Center and can print from anywhere if you send an email to this address. The printer will print the email and the attachments.

The printer comes very well packed, so well packed in fact that one would be wise to carefully follow the pictorial printer setup instructions because they show you where to find all of the pieces of blue tape you will need to remove.  I was up and printing and copying and scanning in less than two hours and much of that was paranoid me wanting to be absolutely certain I had read and understood the instruction correctly (which I invariably had) before executing it so as not to risk messing up somebody else's computer in addition to having to download the printer installation software because the notebook I was testing with had no CD-ROM drive.

Your annoyance will be magnified if you choose not to set up HP's ePrint, instead just setting it up for use as a wireless printer, because you will be advised to TEMPORARILY connect the printer to your computer with a USB printer cable during the wireless setup....

I particularly like the H-Print app feature, so now I can print directly from my phone or my Kindle Fire!

Right out of the box, the HP envy was easy to install. There is no DVD or manual, but you go to the HP website and download the drivers, etc that you need. At that point, you can also get the information on the H-Print app for your other devices. Very easy to figure out.

As the aging tower PC to which that is connected is down for the count, I needed a wireless copier so my family could photocopy, print out documents, and scan from various laptops.

This took me about a half hour to configure with my laptop and to set up the router data. Its footprint is about the same as my older printer, but the door juts out higher where the paper comes in and out, so raising this off of a surface as needed may help if room to clear the countertop or desk is required. It does not store as much paper as an older printer, but it's more streamlined in appearance.

The data entry on the little blue screen is small, and you need to dial in letters or numbers as no keyboard is installed. It's a compact unit, however, and the minimalist buttons show a contemporary look. It's very easy to install and the online platform from HP takes you through the steps.

Once one device is configured, others take less time. Another laptop, for instance, took a few minutes to connect with the setup already in place between the router and the master device.

It found my network and hooked itself up and updated itself online.  It even walked me through the online set up of the HP account, so it would auto-update.  It sets up a personal account on hp.com and they will send you things to your printer (at your direction) like Disney color pages for the kids, or Sudoku pages, or news...there are SO many options!  It has preprogrammed pages for Sudoku, too, along with graph, music, fax cover sheets, etc.  I love it.

I went from a Canon Pixma 450 to this, and the Pixma's footprint was much larger, and was much taller.  It had fax, and this doesn't, but aside from that, I prefer this printer's look.  The height is nice, too.  I had no idea how ""full"" my desk looked with the Canon until I replaced it with this.

It prints much slower than the Canon.  It takes twice the time.  It's loud.  MUCH louder than the Canon.  If I had a lot of printing, that would be a major drawback, as the printer sits right next to me, and if I have to take a call, it would interfere.

It's a great price for the work done.  The prints are clean and crisp, even with recycled (not the best) paper.
HP's ink is easy to find, too.  Unlike the Canon's.
It holds the same amount of paper (about 1/2"" tall).

When you go online, you can set up an account that will automatically send you refills for your ink (charged to your account, of course).  I thought this was terrific, as I live far from any store that carries office supplies.  I'm not sure how the pricing compares, but they do give you a ""percent off"" coupon when it's time to refill...

Oh--this is the BEST part--
I had to ditch the Canon after just a few months because it had a paper jam, and after it was cleared, it never printed aligned again.  I tried everything.  This HP opens up so much that you can clear a paper jam without worry of misaligning the print heads.

Geek Roger Meyer has tested and reviewed Envy. Here is his report:

The HP Envy 4500 has a very appropriate name (Envy).  Other printer manufacturers should be envious of this printer.  I would like to think I am being objective, but there are so many great things about this printer, this review may seem to be biased.  It looks good, works as advertised, is feature rich, and the user manual (on line and downloadable) is one of the best I've read.

The printer is elegant in appearance and has an LCD interface that is easy to read and operate.  The menu items are easy to understand and are intuitive.  There is an auto-off function that powers down the printer after a preselected time that is supposed to aid in saving ink by parking the print heads.  All the functions, print, copy, and scan, were tested and worked flawlessly.  Print times were quick and the quality was excellent.  The same can be said of the copy and scan functions.

One of the things I liked most about this printer was the ease of setup.  With a history of laborious hardware and software installations that involved extensive interactive dialogs, I was impressed with the simplicity of this setup - even the wireless functions.  It was painless, and everything worked as advertised upon completion.  I especially love the ePrint capability.  With the free HP ePrint app downloaded onto my Android phone, I was able to print directly to the printer through my home WiFi network.  Also, since the desktop PC I was using had wireless connectivity to my network, I could print wirelessly to the printer.  One less cable to clutter up the desktop!  The printer can be connected to a PC via USB cable also (not supplied).

I find it difficult to find any big negatives.  It does have a larger footprint than some other compact all-in-ones.  The ejected paper holder slides out of the paper tray ""pocket knife"" fashion.  The little flip up paper stop seems a little flimsy, but during the evaluation, I did kept it closed and let the paper eject onto the desktop.

For the price (less that $100 at Amazon) this printer can't be beat.  It looks good, has great features, works well, and is built by a company with a long history of quality printer manufacturing.

I desperately wanted a printer with wireless connectivity since we have 3 laptops, 2 desktops and 2 smart phones. It's a big step up for me - LCD display, wireless, duplex printing. The only minor downside is that the setup instructions weren't entirely straight forward. It comes with a pamphlet of pictures (no words). I have 64-bit Windows 7. It took me a little longer than I anticipated figuring out how the ink cartridge clicked in, but then I realized that it's designed such that the ink cartridge will be slanted forward when first installed, and then snaps flat as the cover comes down. Maybe I'm just accustomed to my other printer, but that is something that would have been useful to note in words on the instructions.

Also, my printer printed the calibration page as indicated in step 6 of the setup, but did not offer the scanning portion of the calibration page. Confused. Then for step 7 of the pamphlet, it says to go to a website to complete installation. Well, as luck would have it, that site was down for maintenance when I tried to go. So then I grabbed the manual where it said I could also install from the CD. I inserted the CD and it gave me the option to go online or install from the CD. Just for kicks, I clicked the online button and it took me to a different web address than the one the pamphlet instructions said. The new website was working and I was able to download and install software. I opted to connect wirelessly, and it couldn't connect. Apparently I needed to run the setup wizard on the printer first to get it connected to the wifi - then run the wizard on the computer. However, I only found instructions on how to get the printer wifi connected from the troubleshooting of the failed computer install. Despite the poor instructions, once I ran the setup wizard on both printer and computer, the installation completed. You should be able to figure it out on your own, but clear instructions would make it go faster. Our other laptops run Ubuntu (Linux) and installation there was a piece of cake now that the printer was connected to our network. No need for the CD or any website for Ubuntu - it just works.

This printer is much faster at printing than my previous 3-in-1 color ink jet printer.  I haven't tested it for photo quality, only for document printing - which is what I will be primarily using it for. I am confident the photo quality is excellent. I am happy that this printer does automatic duplex (double sided) printing. It even allows a pause for the ink to dry between sides to prevent smearing.

1) The format is friendly.  Set up and use are simple and straight forward.  Even establishing the wireless connection was a breeze.

2)  Ah, the wireless connection.  This is my first wireless printer and I feel so clever when I print from my laptop on the porch or from my iPhone.  (The phone app is free but must be downloaded.)

3) For a budget printer it prints quickly and quietly (but then we've established that I'm out on the porch). Please note the comment added by 'Bob' below.  He finds his printer to be noisy. Mine isn't, so I can't change my evaluation based on his opinion, but potential buyers might want to read Bob's review if quiet is important to you.

I almost did not buy the printer because of one reviewer that could not connect to it and said it was incompatible with Office 2007.  I have Office 2007 Professional and run Windows 7 Ultimate, 64 bit on all my computers.  After installation, I ran a quick test print from MS Word 2007 and it printed beautifully. I will install the second wireless printer on my daughter and granddaughter's computers tomorrow as a replacement for their Epson 220.  This is a great printer and unbeatable for the price, but if you're doing a lot of photo prints and want the highest quality results, or want to print direct to cd's look at the Epson Artisans.  If you can live with just ""very good"" prints. this HP Envy 4500 can do the job. By the way, it also scans.",09-13-2013

Our application was a little unusual , as part of the mat is on a medium nap carpet and the back part hangs out over a linoleum floor. ( Between to rung and the linoleum floor is a metal trim strip.) In order to protect hard floor from damage by the ""knobs"" on the chair mat, I cut a piece of carper just slightly larger that the bare part of the floor under the mat. So far it is working well. This makes the entire mat is quite even and the transition from the carpet to the part where I added the carpet over the bare floor is  smooth. It looks like I will occasionally have to re-orient the pieces, but that's not hard and it is not necessary very often. We are pleased because this has solved a problem and has made using my office chair enjoyable again! The mat itself looks like it will hold up quite well. I would purchase it again.",08-17-2017

It has been terrific.  I have it on a carpet that has about 3/8"" depth, to work from home at a computer desk on a daily or near daily basis.  My chair has wheels.  There has been absolutely no cracks nor any ""chair wheel dimples"".  The chair rolls freely while I am sitting on it without getting caught in any depressions made in the mat from frequent use of the chair in the same spot.

By comparison, mats I previously bought at Staples would start to crack within a month, and form sizeable depressions where the wheels are, making the chair pretty much get stuck in one spot not too long after buying it.  If I try to adjust the position of my chair a few inches from where I normally put it, it rolls back into the depressions.  But, this Flortex mat has shown no signs of having that issue.  It almost rolls too easily... I would kind of prefer if it had more resistance to moving to a different spot so it would remember my ""current"" position while I'm sitting there.  But, that's not the mat's fault.",08-05-2017

We just moved into a new house and have carpet in the office now so I had to buy one of these mats.  I have been burned before by mats that curl up on the edges and I did NOT want to spend $50 just to have to deal with that, so I tried this one.  I was SO EXCITED when it arrived packaged in a big flat cardboard box!  NO UNROLLING!  HALLELUJAH!  I put it in place and that very night my 230 pound husband sat and worked at the computer for about 3 hours and it was great!  Here's what I love:

- SIZE:  While I would prefer to have an even bigger size so I could roll around to all the corners of my large editing desk and nearby drawers, but the bigger the mat, the more expensive, so I went middle of the road with this and it's certainly large enough to accommodate my standard office chair and some drifting around without it going over the edge accidentally.  This size is certainly sufficient if you don't have to roll around too much!  I got the 37"" x 45"" with the rectangular lip.
- THICK:  Unlike others I've tried, this mat feels really thick and durable.  I admit that I worry about cracking but have had no problems with that yet and because it's polycarbonate I have high hopes that it won't!
- NO CURLING:  Because of the material it's made of, you never have to worry about the edges curling, regardless of how long you use it.  Nothing makes me crazier

What I don't like so much:
- SLIPAGE:  This does have nice little carpet cleats but still moves around a little on our medium pile carpet which is unfortunate but isn't a deal breaker.  I think most mats do ""wander"" a little bit over time.  It isn't a significant amount, just an inch or two here or there but it still requires occasional re-positioning which is a bit annoying.  If the carpet cleats were more substantial perhaps this wouldn't be an issue.

Other than that I really love this mat so far and can highly recommend it!  I'll update if it cracks or dents at some point but so far so good!  For the record I did NOT receive this item for free or at a discount.  Hope this helps!",03-16-2017

I searched and found that I needed a polycarbonate mat like this product.  This item was just the right size (48"" x 48"") for my setup.  When it arrived, it was rolled and strapped inside a long box.  Use care to cut the strap just like the instructions say, and it lays flat immediately.

I have low-pile carpet in my house with thick padding, and so far this floor mat holds up, my chair rolls easily and doesn't get stuck.  One issue I'm having that I read others have - is the mat will ""slide"" over the course of a day several inches.  I have no idea how but it does.  The ""spikes"" don't seem to be long enough to keep it firmly in place, which is why I gave it four stars.  I've just been moving it back into place, but I am going to find a way to ""Anchor"" it to the floor (like your carpet mats in your vehicle).

This mat is used in my home so is only used sporadically.

Pros: I was concerned that the edges at the top and bottom of the roll might stick up a little making them a trip hazard, but ""No"" all edges seem to very slightly turn down and there is no tripping hazard at all.

Cons: I checked to be sure it had little spikes to hold it in place on my extremely low pile carpet.  It does, but they aren't long enough.  It slides all around and I can't keep it in place.  It has to be straightened daily and depending on how long I'm at the computer, sometimes more often than that. I'm sorry I chose it. Would absolutely not buy it again.",11-24-2016

The mat has clean lines, but unfortunately quite thin material; any pressure a few inches from the corner makes that edge of the mat 'pop up' from the (""normal"" length) carpet, which is a stumble hazard. Because of this tendency to uproot itself, the mat also moves around way more than it should, so I find that I am constantly adjusting it, including having to pull it down off the legs of my desk, where it has curled upward along the furniture.

This chair mat is a completely different type of polycarbonate and is much thinner and my chair slides around easily.

Even my previous floor mat would start to yellow within a few weeks of use, but this is still as clear & clean as the first day it arrived.

I can fix that my putting velcro tape on the bottom but I think this is  an inherent flaw. I could live with that, but for me this mat is just slightly too small. My chair has five wheels and one of them is constantly sliding off the mat. It's a standard size desk chair. I measured and thought the mat was big enough, but it's really needs to be about 2 inches bigger. The next size up was a lot more expensive though. Otherwise, it seems like a solid mat and my chair rolls easily (maybe a little too easily) across it.

It sticks up off the carpet enough to easily kick it. I bought my friend one and she is kicking hers as well.  I must kick it at least once a week.  I do work from home a lot.

My old mat of the same size from one of the brick & mortar office supply stores from a different manufacturer had been a bit more flexible than I'd liked and had started cracking and falling apart within 2 years of daily & regular use. My office has a thin berber carpet laid over a standard pad on a concrete slab and the fact that the earlier mat could flex at all was a surprise when I got it. Not so with this mat. It arrived sandwiched flat in between two layers of cardboard stapled together around the perimeter. The corners of the packaging were crushed pretty badly so I opened the package with some concern, but the mat itself was perfectly fine and flat. Dimensions are exactly as described as are the rest of the features of the mat. My chair rolls so much easier on this mat that it took a couple of weeks to get used to it but once past that initial period, I find I like it much better. There is a texture to the mat surface such that there is a small bit of initial resistance to rolling but once you start moving it actually rolls easier than it did no the old mat. My only issue and it is very minor is that the edges of the mat have no bevel or ramp so if a chair wheel rolls off, most of the time you need to lift your weight off the chair a bit to bring the wheel back on to the mat since rolling directly back on can cause the wheel to catch on the mat edge. In all other ways so far, this mat is far superior to the previous vinyl material mat I had.",03-15-2016

Kind of lame to be excited over such a product, but it is oh so nice to sit down in your chair and be able to glide effortlessly around.  My old mat protected my floor but had a softness to it that made the rolling around part no where near as nice as this mat.  I hated to spend the money on such a mundane product- but am sure glad I did.  It came flat in a box so I just took it out and put it to work.

I give it 4 stars because I think it's a little pricey being over $50.

The little prongs to keep it in place on the carpet seem to have worked out fine.  My chair rolls over it just fine even when I reach the edges.  There is no feeling of my chair dropping off the side of it.  My mat has the lip on it and I don't have the lip completely under my desk because I really don't sit that far under the desk.  This placement gives me more room to roll around in the area that I am accustomed to.  So looking at it one might wonder why it's placed the way it is.  But so what, it's for my comfort zone :-)

Also thank goodness it arrived in a flat box versus a rolled mat like I've read in some of the reviews.  This mat is very rigid and I just can't imagine that once rolled that it would ever truly flatten out.  So I'll stand with my original comment for now that so far so good.

I've used one of this thin quality before and they don't last. My last one was very thick and lasted several years. In my opinion, this item is not worth the price.

Within specs of what this mat was supposed to work best with. Second, I am in and out of my chair a lot but I would think this mat could stand up to that as that's what it's made for is it not?
First complaint, it moves. It shouldn't according to the specs and the pile length of my carpet. I consider this a flaw.
Second, it's already showing signs of divots. I'm not overweight, nor a large person and am disappointed in this manifestation.
I've had mats before, so I know how well they can work. This one? Not a fan - won't buy this mat again.",08-08-2015

Far better than any I've gotten from office supply stores, costco, etc over the years - and I've gone through many of them. I purchased this in July of 2011 - and only in the last two months has it begun showing signs of cracking under one of the wheels. That's well more than twice as long a lifetime as any of the previous mats.

I just now filed a warranty claim form on the mat, since it has a lifetime warranty. Not sure if they'll accept the claim or  not, but even if they don't, I'll be replacing it with another of exactly this make and model. It cost me seventy dollars back in 2011 - that's about eighteen dollars a year. Cheap. Even at today's higher price of ninety-two dollars, it's still a bargain.

UPDATE: I should have updated this months ago. They honored the warranty, and sent me a replacement for just the cost of shipping (I sent them photos of the damage, they didn't require me to send them back the old one!). Excellent customer service.",03-22-2015

But maybe for good reasons.,"How soon a mat cracks depends on its own strength, and also the quality of mats previously used on the carpet. With a second-rate mat, casters not only dig through the carpet but also dent the underlay. When a new mat comes along, the casters gravitate to those dips, and that stress results in a crack. So it's worth the investment in decent quality. It's also useful to move the chair around so that the casters aren't in the same place day after day.

My first mat, 25 years ago, was $100-200, maybe 5 mm thick, and rode flat on anything. I stupidly gave it away when moving, and went through a couple of $15-20 mats that turned out to be useless (I cut and re-used the good sections for various things, e.g. stuck a piece under the rototiller to protect the patio from oil drips). More recently I bought an ES Robbins from Costco, it measured 3 mm, ostensibly had a lifetime guarantee against cracking, though the amount of duct tape that held it together at the end told a different story.

I got this Floortex 14 months ago, the 35x47 version. It's even thinner than the Robbins, at 2 mm, lighter and generally flimsier to the touch. It bent a little into those weak spots in the carpet, but nowhere as much as the Robbins. So I thought the polycarbonate did make a difference. Now the fractures have started, and are worsening rapidly. I've dropped the rating to 3 stars. Why so generous? In fairness, this mat did have to cope with those dips in the underlay. It would have done better starting out on a flat carpet.

Nonetheless, the claim to be the toughest mat and the lifetime guarantee are nonsense. 2mm polycarb just doesn't deliver that.

The surface is lightly textured, and on the bottom are short spikes every inch or so for traction. On some other mats these are so sharp that they can draw blood while handling. The spikes on the Floortex have a more forgiving depth and rounded points. Made in UK.",03-22-2015

I have a ""standing desk"" and stand on this mat for 4-6 hours/day while working, to keep from wearing the carpet; the mat is somewhat flexible and is comfortable to stand on, and the flexibility suggests that it will be less likely to fracture and crack.  It had no odor and is clear, so it is relatively unnoticeable.

The bad news/less good news - it is thinner than I thought it would be (the add says 0.1 inch, but it is actually 1/16"", 1.5 mm) - when you are standing on it, and it is placed on a ""medium pile"" carpet, the edges raise up slightly, which can then be tripped on by someone who comes over to stand near you, for instance. Its worst aspect from my point of view is that on my carpet, which has pile measuring 0.55"" (14 mm) thick, the mat moves all over the place.  The little prongs on the downside that go into the carpet are only 1/6"" long (4 mm) and simply are not enough to hold the mat in one place.  I do not run and leap onto it or anything, the movement is entirely due to normal use - stepping on and stepping off.  I frequently have to readjust its position to keep it from getting up against another piece of furniture, as well as just to put it back where it belongs - you know?.

Maybe the company will say that it was not intended for carpets like mine, which as noted has pile which is 0.05"" higher than 0.5"", after all they only rate it for pile up to 0.5"".  If so, fair enough, but let the buyer beware.  I personally would find it surprising if the mat behaved all that differently on pile that was precisely 0.5"" high (or even a bit less than that?).

In any case, if you have a relatively firm, low-pile carpet, this might be just the ticket - otherwise, you may want to consider my experience.",02-09-2015

It wasn't the cheapest, but seemed the best and most economical in the long run for my situation. The most common complaint seems to be that the mats are too thin and when used on carpet, the chair leaves dents and is hard to move out of the dents. I have carpet about 1/4 pile. This mat is thick like the ones I used to have at work, and so far does not dent at all on my carpet. I've used it for about six weeks. Another complaint I saw frequently was that other mats were packed rolled or folded and were difficult to flatten out. This one arrived flat, just stapled (not through the mat) between two corrugated cardboard sheets. One caution: if you've been using your chair on carpet without a mat, as I had for several months, take care that you don't go flying because the chair will rolls so much more easily with the mat! Will report back later if I have any problems with durability (another common complaint with chair mats).",10-04-2014

I just moved and switched from wood to carpet so I had to change chair mats.  My previous mat was fine on wood but on carpet it would slide and wheels would sink into mat and make it hard to roll back.  I'm 6' and 300 lbs.  With this new 'Floortex Ultimat Polycarbonate Chair Mat for Low/Medium Pile Carpets 48x53' my chair slides around nicely on it.  I didn't realize how discolored my old one was (I had it for many years) and this new one is clear.  My statements are from the perspective of switching from really old wood mat to new carpet one and responding to reviews I've read before purchasing this one.

Even at 300 lbs my wheels are not sinking into the mat (at least not that I've noticed).  I think some who have sinking wheels it may be that the underlying carpet is too plush or carpet is older, not sure.  My carpet is less three years old, tight weave, and well padded, and not too think.  I also have not noticed the mat sliding around at all.  I also didn't sense strong odor (probably because its polycarbonate).  And lastly, it came in a big box, rolled up, via UPS, and completely undamaged.  It actually unrolled and flattened out in one night.  The ONLY reason I didn't give it five stars is that I think the carpet teeth could be a touch longer, and it could be a touch thicker for this price.

Pros:
Seems to be durable, no issues after 5 months.
Does not curl at edges
Firm material, chair legs don't create dents

Cons:
Just one. It slides around too much. The grippers on the back are basically spikes with the ends chopped off so they're flat. My old mat had spikes that were sharp (actually hurt to pick up) and held in the carpet perfectly. Unfortunately I cannot seem to find anything like this anymore.",03-13-2014

I'm glad I got the larger size (47"" X 53"") because I slide my chair between two desks and the longer side helps.  My only quibble is that the mat tends to get out of position after a few days.  It has small studs on the back and they do a fair job of holding it in place on my fairly thick carpet, and it's easy to put back in place after removing my chair.  Also, the 53"" size has a small extension in the middle of the longer side to get to 53"". The mat cuts back a little on both sides at the longer end, with a tongue or lip that sticks out to reach the full 53"".",03-13-2014

The material works great, and may last a lot longer, but it was quite expensive. I went with the smallest size for $60 and found we could have used the much bigger one. The only issue is that the mat slides around constantly, and I was careful to measure the length of the pile. When someone is sitting on the mat, the edges lift up from the floor, so that must be how it moves around so much. Turns out, we should have gotten the more expensive model for the deeper piles.

Today is February 16, 2014

The whole thing still works it is still hard, and it is still super flat (honestly it is really nice). However there are cracks ALL over it.

It has been used everyday. It still works better than the soft ones that curl up over time and crack badly.

I've got a lot of use out of it, and I suspect I have another 2 months before it really needs replacing.

The cracks are visible (some of them are minor scratch like cracks but most are full cracks that go to the bottom of the mat)
Cracks do not affect my rolling ability. (even for cracks they are flat, no wheel grabbing [that I can feel at least] just smoooooth rolling)

I'd buy this again just because it is hard, nice to roll on, doesn't curl up on the edges, and doesn't bend under my weight (at least not noticeably).

Especially for the rolled-up type mats. The carpeting in my basement office is 24"" interlocking floor tiles, not very good quality but they suffice. I've replaced the squares beneath my chair several times, the rollers warp and distort the tiles and make it a nuisance to just sit down. I saw a similar mat as this in a doctor's office, on hardwood floors and figured this would be a better solution though it was a bit more expensive than the roll-ups. I've only had it for a couple days but I feel certain this will work well. The little studs on the underside totally keep it in place, my chair glides like it's on rails. I don't foresee any tripping hazard. It came delivered between full size flat heavy cardboard, so no unrolling/lay flat issues.

Knowing this, when I moved into my new apartment, I wanted a mat that wasn't going to do this (it was very important to me to protect the new carpet).  So, I ordered this mat after seeing it on substantial discount.

Even after the discount, it was still more than a typical vinyl mat, but for the month that I've owned it, I would say it was worth it.  So far, there have been no problems with the mat.  It laid down flat right out of the box, sounds robust (love that wobble sound effect when you're picking it up!), and so far hasn't given me any challenges save for a bumped heel a couple of times when my foot grazed the edge.  The edge lays relatively flat, but a caster with a whole man's weight on it can cause it to bend upwards ever-so-slightly if it's close enough to one of the corners. This isn't a problem under normal circumstances, but if you are the type to push away from your desk and turn around 180 degrees before getting out of your chair in one quick motion, be careful not to pop the bottom of your heel against it.  It's pretty tough material!

I bought the 47x35 with the lip and wish I'd bought the bigger one. With the bigger one, the constant moving around or drifting of the mat might have been less irritating. I have to constantly adjust this. And, I have a medium pile carpet for sure - I even measured it.

So, I would strongly recommend a bigger one and seriously consider this version for thicker carpet so that the spikes are longer and hopefully there would be less drift. I will likely replace this in a few months because I find the constant adjusting kind of annoying.",07-22-2013

But this one however, It is very solid, holds up great, and in general, works great. So far, the only fall back to it that I have found, is that if you do not slip it up under the desk quite a bit, it will slide around.

I thought for sure it would have a bow that would take time to subside; this was not the case.  The 48x48 mat was rolled to a diameter of about 12"" and was secured with one nylon pallet type banding strap.  I cut the strap with a utility knife and was not prepared for what happened next.  The coiled mat was like a coiled spring held under immense pressure and exploded the instant the banding was cut and released.  I would say the force of the mat springing from its coiled position to perfectly straight was enough to seriously hurt someone if it were to hit them. I cannot believe that someone has not been seriously injured.  So... be very careful when cutting the banding!

I was disappointed with the thickness of the material.  This mat is thinner than any mat I have ever had.  Thinner than the $15 mat from Costco it was replacing.  The Costco mat would not allow my chair to roll on it easily as the casters on my chair would sink into it.  Upon removing the old mat, I noted that the new mat was made from a much harder material.  After one day, my chair rolls beautifully on it.  Not sure how long that will be the case or how long it will last however.  I'm hopeful that a year from now (if someone reminds me) I can update the review with good news.

I was uncertain about the depth of my carpet and if this was the right mat. The spikes on the bottom are not quite as long as those on the generic (one size fits all) Costco mat.  I believe it will work perfect for my application.

One more thing: The description on the mat says ""crystal clear""; this is not the case.  Or at least not what I was expecting.  Although the material is not cloudy, the finish on the top surface is textured with a nonslip sandpaper type of surface.  It kind of reminds me of some shower doors I have seen, where you can see someone through it, but the image is blurred.  Still, it looks great on the floor and I like the finish.",06-29-2013

The last one of these carpet mats I ordered lasted about 4 years. It was subjected to daily use and I am a heavier than average person to the weight on my chairs 5 plastic rollers is probably high. The mat is on medium height carpeting. I did not save the receipt for that mat but I think I paid about $30.00 for it and it lasted a year or two more than the previous 5-6 mats I've ordered over the years, so I would have re-ordered it if I could remember the make and model. I am going to save the receipt to see how long this one lasts. Initial review is that this seems very sturdy. It shipped flat, A BIG PLUS as I've had some that never laid completely flat after being rolled up to be shipped. Shipping was quick, ordering was easy, price was right.

Don't you believe it.

My Obus Forme back chair has standard rollers, and the mat rests on a low-pile, thin padding carpet surface, so it shouldn't be overly-tough on chair mats. However, this Cleartex mat started cracking within a few months. It was surprisingly thin, light, and rigid--maybe that's part of the problem. It developed dozens of long parallel cracks around the most common roller contact points. Soon, the mat was coming apart, the carpet was being damaged, and the mat had to be thrown out. I replaced it with a much cheaper one (non-polycarbonate) from Costco, which is still going strong after more than a year.",10-13-2012

I'll start by confessing to be a little on the hefty side.  I tip the scales at 210 pounds. Er . . . I mean 215 pounds. Or so.  So I need a mat that can take some weight without the chair casters sinking into the mat. With the first three I bought, if I stayed in one place for more than a few minutes, the casters would do just that, sink.  This mat, not at all.
I notice one reviewer pointed out the corners ""curl up.""  Mine did do that a bit.  I believe it is a consequence of the hardness of the polycarbonate- the downward pressure of the weight of the chair and person in the center naturally causes this.  But a couple small squares of double-sticky carpet tape takes care of the problem.
 After three mats that didn't do the job for me, and almost a year of use of this mat, I am very pleased and recommend it, especially if you are a bit on the heavy side.",02-12-2012

Awarded at the 4-Star level due to the fact that the mat walks around, very slowly.  You don't know when or why, but it always ends up slid towards the side desk by Friday.

The mat is not one that you can roll up at all (not that I intend to, but something of a much more flexible material would allow it to lay more smoothly on the carpet).  This leaves me concerned about edges that can be tripped on and I am not the most graceful of individuals, so I'm just hoping I don't have any troubles.

My initial thought was ""I hate it"" but I've grown past that point.  I do wish it was less rigid, though.  It also makes a pretty annoying sound when rolling a chair over it; being a harder plastic, it isn't a terribly smooth sound when a chair coasts.",08-26-2011
