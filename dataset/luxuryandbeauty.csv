I really like its scent, but its protection doesn't last very long. Then I got the Baxter deodorant, which is insanely effective, but with a strong, cheap scent that I find distracting. I was skeptical of the MenScience, mostly because of the generic brand name I'd never heard of. But I've been very impressed.

There is no discernible scent, and the protection lasts a long time. Of all the deodorants with benign ingredients, this is my favorite so far. And while some slight irritation is (for me) a worthwhile trade-off for effective, aluminum-free deodorant, the MenScience hasn't caused a rash.

He also warned me that it was very expensive, but it will last you for up to three months he assured me. After using a popular brand of under arm deodorant for close to thirty years I suddenly have developed a sensitivity to one or more of the ingredients in it. This caused sore red patches of dermatitis to form in my under arm area. For whatever reason my left underarm seems to be the worst affected. While this brand is definitely milder, it still caused my left underarm some irritation and made it feel itchy. It is also Wintertime here in Michigan, so I perspire a lot less, due to the cold dry weather. It will be interesting to see if this deodorant is up to the task come Summertime. This product has absolutely no scent to it.

I also ordered an Almay product to try, but it has not arrived yet. The Almay product is less than half the cost of this product. I think this product is over-priced for what it does.

EVER!!!!!!!,"I absolutely LOVE this deodorant!!!  I stumbled across it almost accidentally, but was eager to try it, even at the higher price point, because I have extremely sensitive skin and the deodorant I had been using was starting to irritate my underarms (I suspect that, as with all conventional antiperspirants, the aluminum oxide eventually becomes the problem).  The formulation of Androceuticals, their mission statement, and the other customer reviews raised my hopes that maybe I'd found the answer...

Well, I did find the answer!!  Not only does it absolutely live up to the ""non-irritating"" claim, but it also is the best odor protection that I've ever experienced with any deodorant product.  Even after a hard workout at the gym when I'm dripping in sweat I don't even get a hint of bad odor (whereas with the last product I was using I'd start to smell myself about halfway into my workout.)

And the cherry on top (even though it is not technically an antiperspirant and makes no claim to stop sweating)... I have always been one of those heavy underarm sweaters.  I've coped for years with embarrassing pit marks, stained undershirts that I constantly had to replace, and searching for fabrics that best hide underarm sweat.  Well, whatever the reason, I find that I sweat MUCH LESS than ever now that I am using this product.  Perhaps it's psychosomatic, but I doubt it since I had no expectation that this was going to do anything to stop wetness.  All I know is that I will never use another underarm product again.

The price may seem high, but I tell you it's worth it.  And I am finding that it lasts WAY LONGER than traditional solids, so in the long run it may actually cost about the same as conventional products.  Also, consider what conventional deodorants do to your clothing.  The savings in replacing undershirts alone makes this worth it for me.",01-06-2017,01-06-2017

After much research I decided to order this for him, and I'm so glad I did.  Yes it's crazy expensive compared to the $5 sticks you can buy else where, but it WORKS. Not only are his shirts no longer being ruined, but he doesn't smell like anything, anything at all.

The real test though was when I went to church and wore a long sleeve white shirt. I was dry for about an hour or so after putting it on but it didn't last as long as I would've hoped and I ended up re-applying when I came back home a few hours later. I wanted it to work but what I've noticed works best for me is combining this with a good smelling deodorant.

I have noticed the underarm odor for the last year, especially when I work out in a Dry fit shirt or long 10 mile plus hikes and then just waking up in the morning. My wife does not want my arm around her (I'm 6' 2"" and she is 4"" 11"") so you can imagine where my Pits hit her.
I have tried a few deodorants at the local drug store ,the name brands
and they smelled good for a Bit, but 30 Min. later I could tell it was coming back.

I did not want any aluminum  and I did not want an antiperspirant , sweat is healthy for you (your body  needs to  detoxify)
This stuff absolutely works and Yes its Pricy but so is having a reputation for BO and I can use my shirts more than once so it makes up for the cost 10X
Great product:: It kills the bacteria that causes the odor and despite being a deodorant not an antiperspirant, I has decreased the sweating as well and totally eliminated any odor even working outside for 12 hours no problem , It has no smell,

Nearly all of the deodorant solutions out there use very harsh (toxic?) ingredients designed to clog your sweat glands and mask odors with perfume.

In fact, once I hit a certain heat or activity threshhold I would the product melting in my pits... Yuck!

It's all about balance and about using products on our bodies that are gentle. Menscience deodorant truly delivers on both counts. It's odorless and clear. It never feels nasty in the heat of activity and seems to keep most of the bacteria/odor action to a minimum. It's cost is easily justified by the way it treats my shirts. It's not 100% effective...

I tried the Malin + Goetz version of this, which smelled great, but offered little in the way of protection. So I tried this on a whim, and my expectations were met or exceeded in every aspect.

I tend to sweat a decent amount. Probably more than average, but there are definitely people who sweat more than me. This deodorant definitely can last a full day at the office. If I have been sweating more than usual, I may notice a slight odor if I stick my nose right up to my armpit, but barring that, it does a good job blocking odor, comparable to or better than my previous favorite antiperspirant, dove men + care.

My armpits definitely stay dryer with this deodorant than any other that I have used.

The bottle lasts a while - probably 2-3 months or so.

I don't notice any staining on my shirts from using this deodorant, unlike the other synthetic antiperspirants I have used in the past. This is important, as I don't wear undershirts, even to work.

But after using it for a few weeks, I've noticed that it almost strongly emits a clear odor.  That is, it erases underarm stank and replaces it with a cool...nothingness.  This allows my separate cologne scents to shine right through.  While it's not an antiperspirant, I find this holds up fairly well for daily wear, loosing strength by late evening (7-9pm) for me.  Fine for my average work days or applied after my ""pre-going out"" shower.

When I'm going to do some serious exercise I do switch to an aluminum-containing antiperspirant (it just works well), but this MenScience product is great for going-out / office day wear.",04-04-2016,04-04-2016

Used it for 2 years straight now.  Exactly as advertised.  Scent free, bad-chemical free, and yet it works and keeps you without odor all day long.  Also, out of a curiosity, I read some of the 1 star reviews below, quite frankly, because I could not believe there would be any, and I was shocked.  Several people claim to have had burnt underarms??  Seriously?? Either that is a lie, or the people that experienced that are at a level of sensitivity unknown to man..  here's why.  One of the reasons I tried MS Deodorant to begin with, was because of exactly that problem.  Guess what, never experienced that problem again.  In fact, if you already have burnt underarms, and put this on over that damage, it literally feels like a heeling balm.  I know this, because I tried switching off to some cheaper Axe deodorant at one point, as this deodorant is expensive at $20, and my underarms got very burnt.  So, switched back over to MS, and applied over the painful pits, and from moment one, I felt better.  ALSO, my wife has 10x more sensitive skin that I do and spends a fortune on the most expensive products out there to man, I mean, she is a high-priced product guru and genius.  She really suffers from sensitive skin though, so she kinda needs only the best.  With that said, after me harping on MS Deodorant, she thought she'd give those baby-skin pits of hers a go at this miracle find, and now, its the ONLY deodorant she will use.  I pretty much NEVER write reviews, though I read a ton of them, so, it's kinda selfish of me.  But, I really owe the world a review on this product.  So, there it is.  Enjoy.  Actually, try it, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll personally refund your money!!!  haha, just kidding, that's taking it too far.  Enjoy though!",02-17-2016,02-17-2016

I don't know if it was removed in response to my negative comments about it in my review or not. But since it has apparently been removed, that's good news and potentially bad news. The removal of triclosan negates my negative comment but now that the formulation has changed, and I have not tried the new formulation, I don't know if it's as effective a product as what I originally tested.

---
For the last several years I've been using deodorants rather than anti-perspirants. There are several reasons why I've done this but the primary reason was I do not want to use a product containing aluminum anymore because of the links to alzheimers disease that numerous studies have indicated. I was also interested in not trying to alter my bodies natural ability to perspire. Antiperspirants essentally block the pores from being able to sweat.

A deodorant is simply going to help prevent odor caused by bacteria. Companies try different ways to accomplish that... either by fragrance to cover up the odor, some form of ""absorbing"" ingredient like baking soda, some sort of anti-bacteria agent, or some combination of these. Of all the products I used over the last several years, none have effectively worked for more than a few hours. It was very frustrating. I tried a Tom's of Maine product, another product called Naturally Fresh and several others along the same idea. None of them worked for me very well.

This MenScience Advanced Fragrance Free Deoderant is the first one that has truly worked all day for me... and then some. I can apply this first thing in the morning and at the end of the day it is still effectively preventing underarm odor. It applies easily and doesn't require you to flap your arms around for a minute or two to dry before you can put your shirt on. It's fragrance free (although there is a hint of a smell due to the ingredients used, but it is very very minimal) and is not sticky. It just works.

Some people have complained of irritation. I have not experienced any irritation while using this deoderant at all. For me it works perfectly.

My only reservation is that it contains Triclosan. Triclosan has been used for years in soaps and other products. It is an anti-bacterial agent and although there is no hard evidence at this time that it is harmful to humans, the FDA has been reviewing the use of Triclosan. At this point I'm willing to use a product that has Triclosan in it until there is some firm evidence that it might be hazardous in some way. I suspect it is the addition of Triclosan that makes this deoderant so effective.

I am very happy with this deoderant. I like that it is fragrance free and that is works all day for me. It is not an antiperspirant so if you are looking for something that will help with perspiring excessively, this will not help you, But for most people with normal perspiration, this is worth a shot, It sure works for me.

No of course not.  It is however the very best preforming deodorant I have used to fight the bacteria causing 'pit stink'.  If you are working out or your day job is more strenuous than sitting at a desk, you will probably need to reapply at least once a day.  For me, I can put this on after my morning shower and make it to bed 14 hours later without worry.  If I really stick my nose in my armpit and pull in a big whiff, I can maybe identify a slight odor.  This is a big improvement over every other tea tree oil, eucalyptus, or even regular store bought deodorant I've tried.

This won't stop you from sweating but will nearly eliminate any odor from normal perspiration throughout the day.  It does so without any aluminum which is now strongly being linked to Alzheimer's Disease.  I can't live forever, but I'd rather it be my heart or liver that goes before my mind!

This one goes on smoother. The other kind of grabs onto my skin when I'm applying it. This one doesn't have much of a fragrance, but that's fine with me, because that's why I use cologne.
For decades I used old spice high endurance deodorant and didn't think much of changing. About a year or two ago I noticed that my armpits were really itchy at night. After my fiance mentioned something about companies of skin products using a lot of alcohol to make their products, I began to think of my deodorant and how quickly it evaporated from my skin. Although it provided good odor prevention, it definitely contained a lot of alcohol and I'm sure that's what caused my itchiness.
So i set off looking for an alcohol free deodorant and found this MenScience stick.
I've only bought one stick and have been using it for a few months, but in that time, I've become a fan. I believe I will purchase this again, and even though it is expensive, it's worth the money.

I stopped using this deodorant some time back in search of alternatives that were more cost effective, and while I have found a few that work well such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Tidings/dp/B00EOB0042/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Tidings</a>, they aren't necessarily much cheaper.  I still think this is a solid choice for many people, and may very well come back to it in the future.

[In-Depth]

I'll start off by saying that I'm pretty picky and critical about stuff that I buy.  When it comes to personal hygiene products, I'm even pickier.  I'm not proud of it, and I'm not saying it's a positive trait, but that seems to be how I am.

To that end, I am regularly frustrated by the quality and performance of most personal care products.  For years, I had been trying different deodorants only to be forced to settle on ones which I ""hated least"".

A number of years ago on a trip to Malaysia, it seemed I hit my personal Holy Grail of deodorants: Nivea Solid Deodorant with Silver Protect

That stuff was freaking awesome.  It had offered EXCELLENT odor protection and its seemed to be fairly effective as an antiperspirant, too.  Unfortunately for me, I can't find the stuff in the United States.  After a great deal of investigation, I found that Nivea doesn't offer the product line (in solid form) in that form in the US, most likely for licensing or patent reasons.

Regardless, since then I was again forced into settling for more crappy deodorant.

Enter MenScience Advanced Deodorant.  It's not available in brick and mortar stores, it's pricey, and it has a dumb name.  However, it works.  In my opinion this deodorant excels at offering fragrance free odor protection.  Plus it has a really great twist-bottom container with a threaded cap that provides a great seal during transport.  As crazy as it may sound, the best word that I can use to describe the packaging is ""sturdy"".  I like it myself, as it gives it a really solid feel.  Plus, the container is nearly a perfect size.  It's not too big, and not too small.

As you will notice from the other reviews, not everyone will have perfect results with this.  Everyone has a different body chemistry, and what works great for some will not work out so well for others.  I can only say that it's worked fairly well for myself, but I encourage people to experiment and have well managed expectations.  There is no such thing as a single deodorant to rule them all.  If there was, there wouldn't be so much variety. :-)

I ended up being happy enough with the product that I purchased several of them to have in my suitcase and travel kits, in addition to my medicine cabinet at home.

I used a ""regular"" antiperspirant /deodorant gel until the brand I was using added a scent that smelled like cheap insecticide.

Also, this does stain my dark-coloured clothes unless you ensure that the application has completely dried before putting your shirt on.  However, as most people don't have the luxury of waiting up to 10 minutes for this to happen this is a hard ask.

Overall for one living in the tropics given this price-point and the underwhelming performance with shirt-staining embarassment to put up with you may be better off looking elsewhere for your personal hygiene needs.  I know I will.",03-22-2018,03-22-2018

It is unscented and it doesn't cause any irritation, although I have noticed that it leaves a visible residue inside my shirts.

The only complaint I have is that it has what I would call a ""wormhole"" running randomly through the deodorant itself, which is basically a small but very noticeable cavity winding through the substance. This apparent absence of substance would suggest that I didn't receive the exact amount of deodorant listed by weight on the product's label.

It's a very universal scent (for both young and mature people). It's a very sweet and feminine scent - sweet, fruity, a tad bit floral, with a warmer undertone, great for both daytime and nighttime. I would recommend getting a sample or travel-size before purchasing this product. It only lasts a few hours on me, which I don't mind because I like respraying perfume.",07-27-2014,07-27-2014

She opened it and it does smell great. Also, the bottle has the topper and looked to me to be the same or very similar to a non-tester bottle. Either way, it was great and a crazy bargain versus buying in the stores. Awesome item, Amazon!",01-12-2012,01-12-2012

I was instantly attracted to its unique smell ...I must say that I like Viva La Juicy better than this one since it is more  fruity/flowery. Juicy Couture is not bad either..I have worn it in the evening as well as in the day time and gotten compliments all the time. I would not call it a mild fragrance so be careful when you splash it on. It lingers on the clothes even after a long day. Look for deals on Perfumania.com.

I was reading Tuberose and Vanilla aromas have very relaxing and calming properties which will be perfect for me as a nervous bride. This perfume also carries notes of Creme Brulee which happens to be my fiance's favorite dessert! I was wearing a little bit of the fragrance yesterday and he couldn't stop clinging to me...he just loves it!
When I inhaled this perfume's sweet, creamy, soft scent it was true love at first sniff! There is something exotic and just so pretty about it. It is definitely a perfect scent for all seasons. My husband to be also loves Juicy cologne and wears Dirty English by Juicy for Men. I love the way my Juicy Couture and his Dirty English cologne smell together.

I have always worn perfume, but this is something I have never experienced before. Of course, I have had a date, or my husband tell me I smell nice, and a friend here or there tell me they like my perfume...but never like a random stranger guy.
I have had this perfume for only a month, and I have been complimented on this perfume 3 times from 3 Men, of various ages, all complete strangers, who had to tell me how good I smell. One gentleman was riding me in the elevator and asked men what perfume I was wearing YESTERDAY, as in he remembered smelling it on me from the prior day and just had to ask and tell me how much he liked it the next day!

All that aside, since I am not wearing it to impress men (I am a happily married woman). I love this fragrance, its so light and soft. Not over powering at all (unless you put too much, only a little on your hot spots is needed ladies!). Its a nice mixture of floral/fruity, so you can't really pin point which one it is.

I highly recomend this perfume (I found it cheapest at Marshalls BTW), I will definitely be wearing it for a long time. And if you so happen to be looking for a scent that men seem to love. This is it :D",03-11-2011,03-11-2011

As you can probably tell, I have never been very interested in perfume.  Since then, my boyfriend and his mom have given me plenty of other perfumes to try (she is manager of a makeup store).  Nevertheless, Juicy Couture is the only one I like and the only one I wear.  I guess I have good taste because I've been complimented on it by various people on pretty much a monthly basis.  I seem to have gotten my sisters hooked on it, too.  Over the past two years or so since I started wearing Juicy Couture perfume, I've gone through several bottles of it and am hoping to receive another bottle this Christmas.  I strongly recommend Juicy Couture perfume for those who are hesitant about wearing perfume, unsure of which perfume to buy, and those who consider themselves perfume experts, too.

It was $50 for 3.4 oz and I thought, wow, what a good deal!! But I should have known better. When I received it, I was so anxious to use it and bring it to school. But I noticed after a few uses, the scent faded a little quickly, leading me to think that it might be fake. I can't return it now or ask for a refund because it's been opened and used. But next time I would just rather spend a few $$ extra at the department store so I can ensure that it's real. I am disappointed. One time my mom bought fake Dolce Gabbana off the street in Chinatown, and a few weeks later the top smelt musty, and the scent faded away after a few moments. Therefore, I figured it must it be fake, so I hope the same thing doesn't happen my perfume now.

Ahava is really a fantastic cream, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. A dab goes a long way, carries a delightful scent, and heals even the driest skin.

[Updated 12/10/2011: Regarding false comments of a political nature, please note: Ahava has done and is doing nothing illegal under international law, or otherwise, regarding its production facilities, regardless of the opinions of pro-Hamas folks. Obviously a campaign is afoot --- having nothing to do with Ahava's products or their quality --- to delegitimize Israel through boycotts like this.

Here are the facts, both historically and according to established international law. There is no final settlement in the disputed territories. The Palestinian contingent has repeatedly rejected at least five final settlements offered by Israel and its predecessors since the 1920s. The last formal proposal came in 2000 although several more attempts since have been made to arrive at final terms between the disputing parties.

Alas, current Palestinian Authority leaders are just as hard line as Hamas. They do not recognize Israel's right to statehood at all, and regularly so state in official media of every kind. A rhetorical question: How should Israel negotiate with people who openly envision another genocide? I have no answer, and those who boycott Ahava clearly do not either.

Historically, the last internationally recognized High Contracting Party in the disputed territories --- now known as the ""west bank,"" as in ""west bank of the Jordan River"" --- was the League of Nations. In 1922, the League established a Mandate for Palestine, entrusting its administration to the British government, which withdrew in 1948. The world's nations voted on this Mandate after World War I, (and Arabian royals in the Hijaz agreed), just as they voted on Mandates for Iraq, Syria, The Lebanon and so on. This land was intended as part of a national home for the Jewish people. The plan established by High Contracting Parties, and therefore international law, remained in force until Britain unilaterally and illegally established Trans-Jordan to appease the Sharif Feisal of Mecca, whose offspring unsuccessfully attempted to rule where originally assigned. The Palestine Mandate to establish a national home for the Jewish people included what is now generally called the ""west bank."" In 1948, after the United Nations recognized Israel as a state, Jordan rejected the settlement offered at that time, attacked the nascent Israel and illegally seized that land against dictates of international law. Jordan illegally controlled the land until 1967.

Jordan then bombed Jerusalem --- despite repeated peaceful Israeli attempts through diplomatic intermediaries to persuade Jordan not to do so. Israel counter-attacked --- a perfectly legal measure under international law for any established, recognized nation that is attacked.

Israel won the land in self-defense, and has repeatedly attempted to reach a final settlement with those people who claim it. Alas, any final settlement between the parties to the dispute must include an agreement to peace between them --- something the Palestinian Authority refuses to do, as this would require recognizing Israel, which it openly and repeatedly states it never will.

Therefore, under international law, Israel's presence in the disputed territories remains legal. Israel stole nothing from Palestinian Arabs. If their leaders choose to reject a final peace settlement, it's a shame. But international law requires that they do so for there to be any final settlement at all, much less a valid one.]

My skin is on the dry side and also sensitive to many products but not with these. I put this cream on after taking a shower in the evening and the next morning my skin is still soft and hydrated. It's not sticky or greasy and goes on easily. There are no stains on my nightgown or sheets from this cream like I have experienced with Kiehls body cream, at least in my opinion after trying a few samples. It's not a watery cream nor is it too thick and the scent isn't too prominent but it's nice (maybe from the aloe or other ingredients). Price wise it's not the most expensive or the least expensive cream I've tried but it works well and I would definitely recommend this product and any others that Ahava makes!

Noticeable improvement in my skin's softness, within the first day. I also love the scent. It's a very unique scent - can't describe it other than to say it's ""clean and fresh"" smelling.

This lotion, however, disappointed me.  Let's start with the pros:  It has a pleasant, not overbearing scent.  It arrived quickly and although it seemed pricey, it's not too much if it works good.  A little bit also covers a large area so I anticipate it would last for a long time.

So now the negative portion of my review.  I have had this for just a few days and applied it in lieu of my regular lotion, at the same intervals.  It is just not good lotion for me.  It's made my psoriasis much worse in the areas where I've applied it so now I am not only back to square one but I'm behind the curve a bit in terms of how my skin looks and feels.  I'm terribly disappointed that I wasted my money on it and will have to give it to a friend or family member just so I don't waste it.

This lotion may work well for people with regular skin but for those who suffer from psoriasis like me, it's just not going to work.  At least that has been my experience with it; others may have a different reaction.  I really wanted it to work and am disappointed that it did not work for me.  I would definitely stay away from it if you have sensitive skin.",11-14-2016,11-14-2016

The scent.  Oh my dear goodness, this smells like baby powder and clings like no-one's business.  Wash my hands, its still there.  Sleep all night...STILL there.

AND DISHONEST WEBSITE REVIEWS

This is probably the first time I've used a lotion where the scent was so annoying and offensive that I couldn't sleep until I had washed it completely off.  I liked how the lotion absorbed quickly but the scent...  The scent is sort of like baby powder.  I never expected a higher end body lotion to have such a generic and annoyingly clinging scent.  Now I'm stuck with a double bottle of this when I can't even stand to have it on longer than a few minutes.  The scent isn't strong but when I get a whiff of it from moving around it just annoys me and feels like it clings to my nostrils.  I hoped the scent would fade after an hour or two but it did not and I had to eventually shower and scrub to get it completely off.

I also received an email by Ahava to write a review about the product, which I took the time to do.  It was a 1 star review in regards to the fragrance.  Immediately after posting the review I was able to view the review but days after I first left the review it was promptly removed.  No wonder the product reviews on their website are 269 4-5 star and only 1 one star and 1 two star.  I wonder how many one or two star reviews were DELETED.  This is dishonest...  Should state in the email we will only post raving reviews of our product so people don't waste their time writing their reviews.

Sense of smell and touch are very subjective. For me this has a strong and lingering perfumey scent of baby powder. It also goes on much greasier and absorbs much more slowly than other lotions I have used, regardless of how much you rub it in. The inexpensive Jergens is less greasy, carries less of an odor and softens just as well. I actually think the Jergens penetrated more deeply than the Ahava. This just simply isn't worth the price.

I had several outbreaks of what the dermatologist said was psoriasis.  Some areas were painful rather than itchy,  It got to the point that I could not wear a sweater without agony. Finally the recommendation was that I use triamcinolone, a corticosteroid cream that is the usual remedy for this condition.  The problem is that this product comes with warnings not to spread over too much of the skin, and I was told to never use it more than five days in a row.
A few years ago my daughter came back from Israel with a tube of Ahava.  My wife rubbed it on a small area of psoriasis on her arm. After a couple of months her skin returned to normal.  My wife insisted that I at least try Ahava for a while before going to the corticosteroid.  Much to my amazement, in a few days I felt much better.  Now I apply it to my upper body twice a day, and I get along without pain and without excessive itching.  It is not 100% effective, but it is at least 90%.  I can live again.  As we say in Yiddish, it is a ""mechaya.""  Whether it would work for everybody I don't know, but it is worth trying.  I certainly hope Amazon continues to make it easily available.",01-16-2015,01-16-2015

It did dry quickly though and came on the stated delivery date so at least that.

I didn't see the ingredients on the product page, so here they are:

Aqua (Mineral Spring Water), Ceteareth-30 & Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Propanediol(Corn derived Glycol), Caprylyl Glycol & Chlorphenesin & Phenoxyethanol, Maris Sal (Dead Sea Water), Dimethicone, Parfum (Fragrance), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Flower Water, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Isoeugenol, Linalool.

For what it's worth, a lot of these last ones (from ""citronellol"" on) are compounds produced by plants and found in plant extracts.  This doesn't contain parabens, which is great.

I like that this does not include any dyes (please note that it does have added fragrance).  It has a perfect texture for a body lotion -- not too thick and not too thin.  I've only been using it on my lower legs  -- to make it last longer, and to get an idea of its effects over time.  But the skin on my lower legs is super smooth.  This is great to use after shaving your legs, and even though I have sensitive skin, I found it completely non-irritating.

The smell took a little getting used to.  It's not bad, but it's unusual for a body lotion.  The perfume level is not heavy at all, though.

All-in-all, this is a really nice lotion and I definitely recommend it.",03-14-2014,03-14-2014

No way will I be able to use this anywhere on my upper body and have to smell it all day! Maybe on the lower legs would be far enough away from my nose to be tolerable.

I decided to just plunge into it and lotion my whole body like i do with other lotions, i discovered that the scent fades very quickly and becomes very suttle just like i like it so that is a HUGE PLUS for me. I love it, and I smell nice and fresh all day, and my skin is so smooth. I combine this with Jericho dead sea black mud soap that i use to shower before i use ahava lotion. AWESOME!

I wish I hadn't spent so much now.

To begin with, the scent is VERY flowery -- so much so that I can't use it at night, as it's too strong and bothers me. I'm also afraid to use it around my daughter, who is allergic to many fragrances, as I suspect it would be a problem for her to smell it on me. So if you don't like flowery scented products, I can't recommend it.

As far as the lotion goes, it seems to work pretty well, but I can't honestly say that it's much better than the other eight or ten types I already have in my house.

I have stopped using this product and returned to the baby oil gel I was using previously. Yes, it is somewhat greasy, but it really works, has very little scent, and is much cheaper.

She warns that you have to let your moisturizer fully absorb before applying the sunscreen or else it all pills up and rubs off your face like eraser sweepings.",11-27-2007,11-27-2007

Oz",4.4,5,Excellent for Winter time,"UVA rays are contant throughout the year, UVB rays are based on actual intensity of sunlight. This is the best UVA sun protection on the market because of the combination of Memorex AND Avobenzone.  To increase the UVB (SPF from 15 to 50) you would need to add either Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, or Oxybenzone for UVB protection.

In America, I believe the FDA has not approved the combined use of Avobenzone with Zinc Oxide or Titanium Dioxide together in the same sunscreen. I don't see why Oxybenzone, Avobenzone, and Memorex SR can't be combined, perhaps too many chemicals in one lotion imposes unforesen harm. This is why in order to raise the SPF and keep the sunscreen safe by FDA standards, it's either Avobenzone or sacrificing a little UVA to up the UVB.

During winter, the UVB threat is lower than summertime, but the UVA threat is merely unchanged, so use this in winter. I hope this helps.",10-12-2007,10-12-2007

When the active ingredient Mexoryl was approved for sale in America, I was excited because I thought it would be cheaper and easier to get. My dermatologist and my own online research have shown Mexoryl is great, so I wanted to use this particular product. However, the formula sold in America is TOTALLY different. The SPF is only 15, which could mean the other cream I had overstated the SPF level? I don't know, but I never got burned and my melasma (darkening due to sun exposure) did not get worse with the other formula. The biggest drawback with the American formula is GREASE. I loved the other formula because I have combination skin with very dry cheeks and it was moisturizing, but very light. Even on my dry cheeks, this stuff is slimy.

I did use the Eucerin spf 30 for years and was also happy with that, but was looking for more broad spectrum protection.

Second, they should make this in a higher spf, in my opinion.  Is this Mexoryl so protective that it negates the need for an spf 30; is spf 15 enough?  I am no dermatologist, so I don't know the science behind all of this...Just basing this opinion on common sense.",07-21-2007,07-21-2007

Boy oh boy, my face became bumpy and my arms were lightly stinging.  My arms experienced burning from the sun and i'm using the suggested amount. After double application, then my arms stopped burning. I have a feeling it's due to avobenzone, it's happened with nuetrogena ultra sheer.

That office lights quip might not be true but it is true that I always burn outside. I wanted something to wear daily on my face under my makeup to mitigate any damage I might be doing to my face by just being outside at lunch or driving in the car. After some research, I purchased this product due to it containing Mexoryl which from all accounts is said to protect better against UV.

I'm extremely happy with this sunscreen. Even though it is only SPF 15, I haven't burned once on my face or my ears. Yeah, that's right, my ears! I'm a vampire, remember? I'm also able to skip the morning moisturizer because this combines the two. It does feel like regular moisturizer as it goes on. I usually use Neutrogena Naturals moisturizer and it feels similar. You don't have to use very much to cover your face so I imagine this tube lasting all summer for me. I only use it on my face because 1) it is expensive and 2) my face and ears are my most burn prone areas. Before I put my makeup on, I let it dry a bit. Usually by the time I get the rest of my clothes on and get ready to paint the face, the sunscreen has dried. Also, I didn't have any white or ashy residue like I'm reading about from other facial specific sunscreens.

Last Sunday, as an example, I put the sunscreen on, went to a Little League game outside in the morning, mowed the lawn in the afternoon and grilled out at about 5:00pm. I didn't reapply the sunscreen at all during the day and I had absolutely no sunburn or even any redness.",05-16-2017,05-16-2017

It's only 15 SPF so it's probably not the best for a day at the beach unless you want to apply it very frequently. It doesn't work very well under makeup because it adds quite a bit of shine, and it's heavy. Nevertheless, I still use it under make up, because it's the best moisturizer with SPF that actually moisturizers, has SPF, and is not toxic that I have found so far (I guess you can't have it all). I think that this cream might work well when alternating the days between the drying mineral based facial ""moisturizers"" with SPF and this one to give your skin some relief from the drying effects of those creams, but I haven't tried it yet.

Honestly, what good does a sunscreen do when you have to meticulously apply it an inch away from all around your eyes? Research shows that more than 10% of all skin cancer occurs in that tiny area around your eyes that probably counts for less than 0.5% of your total skin area. Go for a physical sunscreen (titanium dioxide or zinc dioxide) that you can put around your eyes. Also, if you have sensitive eyes like me, steer clear of Avobenzone.",07-02-2015,07-02-2015

He advised me to get this because of the Mexoryl. It helps with the UVA light which right now according to what he was saying there in there isn't anything else here in the US that does. I tried the Neutrogena with the Heloplex (that is what I was using when I got lobsterfied). I will update my review after using it this summer at the beach.

My dermatologist's office carries lots of brands but not this one. Another office carried it but was out of the 15. I said that was the only one I would buy. The girl at the desk said she had lots of other women who would only use the 15 because of the way it looked on their skin -- I guess that's why they were sold out!

This product keeps my face protected w/spf 15 and mexoryl (which blocks the wrinkle causing UVA rays) during the course of an average day while also keeping it moisturized. Compared to other creams i've used its moisturizing effect last much longer, and it absorbs into the skin well after about 20-30mins leaving a matte finish. It is different than other creams in that a small amount goes a long way. It's somewhat of a paste like texture and if you use too much your face will stay shiny. Use about two pea sized drops and spread it on your face and within 20mins it'll absorb completely.

I'm light olive complected and the whitening effect of those sunscreens turns me slightly green - an awful look. This is my second day using the La Roche-Posay 15 and this is what I notice: slightly tacky/sticky feel but not too bad; it's clear! no ugly tinge. First day wore it alone. Today I put it on, waited half hour (thanks to all the reviewers who cautioned about this) and put on Prescriptive's Traceless. I made sure to dot the foundation all over and blend *lightly* so as not to remove the sunscreen. Works great. Its been six hours and the foundation hasn't moved.

This also works very well on my hands and forearms. My forearms are pretty sun-damaged and the non-chemical sunscreens make sun-damaged skin look worse. This one does not settle into crepey skin and make it look worse. AND checked the price at Target an it was $31.00 so Amazon is the place to buy this!

It's incredibly moisturizing, and while yes, it can add a little oil to one's already combination/oily skin, it feels light, and in combination with makeup/powder one can barely tell one is wearing SPF at all!

I recommend this product for most of my patients, and they love it too (I cannot emphasize enough how, regardless of age, everyone should be wearing SPF, especially to reduce risk of cancer, but also with the added benefit of anti-aging protection!)",04-28-2012,04-28-2012

Oz",4.4,4,"Good Product, But Not The Best With Liquid Foundation","I purchased this sunscreen because it has Mexoryl SX in it (protects from UVA rays).  I would say that this would be best for those in the normal skin range (normal-oily in summer, normal-dry in winter)--I happen to fall in this category.  Some reviewers have commented that it can feel oily and heavy, but rather than oily, I would call the texture as being sticky.  The stickiness is not necessarily unpleasant, but it is a change from most moisturizers/moisturizing sunscreens I've tried.  I don't mind it when I only have this on my face after washing my face, but it doesn't work the best with liquid foundation over it--precisely because of its stickiness.  The problem occurs when trying to rub liquid foundation on your face over this product.  Something about the formulation of the product makes the foundation not so easy to rub into the face--it feels like it clings onto the foundation as you're rubbing it in, so you can't cover as much of the skin's surface before the foundation settles (you end up using more liquid foundation as a result).  I haven't had this problem with previous moisturizers/sunscreens I've used, so you may want to consider this problem before buying.  However, it isn't going to prevent me from using it--I like that it has Mexoryl SX in it, and I'm not a heavy liquid foundation user anyway.  But I did only give it 4 stars because of its relative incompatibility with liquid foundation which, if you are female and wear makeup, could be a reason that you don't buy this product.  If La Roche-Posay makes a version of this product that's more compatible with makeup (specifically makeup bases), I think women would be all over it.",02-11-2011,02-11-2011

The other active ingredient, avobenzone, easily penetrates the skin and is a strong free radical generator as well.

The whole purpose of sunscreen is to protect you from damage, not CAUSE it.

A much safer option is a sunblock - zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. They are photostable when exposed to radiation-aka sun rays and scatter the light rather than absorb it. They also protect BOTH kinds of harmful sun rays(UVA and UVB).

I have been using Cetahpil daily moisturizer SPF 15 for years because it did not make my face break out and it did not sting my eyes when I put it around them.  It is oil free but did cause my face to shine instantly upon application.  A week ago I switched to this sunblock because it offers such good UVB protection (helps prevent the sun from aging the skin).  I was pretty worried that I wasn't going to like it because of all the ""greasy"" comments in the reviews.  I am thrilled that I find it quite a bit less greasy then my Cetaphil was.  I still use the Cetaphil around my eyes because I am afraid the Mexoryl with sting them.  The Mexoryl doesn't contain any oil and so far my skin hasn't broken out from it.

My skin looks even-toned and radiant, not greasy at all. I have been using it for 2 months now and it's been so great. I just love the fact that you get protection from UVA which is the main culprit of aging skin.

What's the difference between UVB vs UVA?

UVB: damages the outer layer of the skin, has been recognized for decades as the cause of sunburn and as a major contributor to skin cancer.
SPF refers to protection from UVB only.

UVA: while not contributing to sunburns -- damage deeper layers of the skin and probably play an important role in wrinkling, spotting, lost elasticity and most deadly form of the dangerous skin cancer, melanoma.

Other sunscreens, even if they market them as ""broad spectrum protection"", don't protect against short UVA rays but this La Roche-Posay product does. FDA approved mexoryl SX which protects your skin from short UVA rays. It's patented by L'Oreal (the mother company).

I highly recommend it. Remember to use it year-round, even when it's cloudy because UVA rays penetrate through clouds and windows.",05-24-2008,05-24-2008

Exec Summary: Solid retinol solution, doesn't seem very strong.","In pursuit of truth, my wife is reviewing this product.  Nothing seems to work on my own leathery face, I'm leaving it to her to describe it.

The Obagi360 isn't the first retinol product we've used.  Usually, when applying you can feel it going to work, a slightly burny, tingling feeling.  Within a couple of days, you begin to notice the effect. Its a little tighter, a little lighter.  Within a few weeks, your skin looks healthy, happy and younger.
The only difference I notices with this Retinol was that the burning/tingling effect was pretty unnoticeable. I didn't think it was working until, a couple days later...  In short, the cream does everything I'd hoped without some of the side effects I've experienced in the past.  Nice job, Obagi Medical!",10-11-2017,10-11-2017

Within a day there was visible irritation in several areas on my face. I thought it might be a fluke and kept using it for another day, but it got worse (severe redness).  I discontinued use of all products for a week and went back to my regular routine and my skin cleared back up.

My face became blotchy and irritated and I didn't use a lot.

SO HOW TO TEST?  Looking around I decided that the back of my hands would be perfect as they look terribly old.  Hot water, sun, gardening, etc. has made my old mom hands look very wrinkly and 'decorated' with some sun/age spots.  So good subject.  I chose one hand, the left, so I could compare and contrast.

Dark spots -- This Obagi Retinol creme has lightened all of the dark spots on the hand I used it on, save one, the oldest.  I can barely see the other dark spots now,  and I'm pleased with those results.  I'll continue with the remaining spot.  Perhaps being the oldest, it's going to take the most time and effort.

APPLICATION -- I use very very little of this creme.  For one thing, it is difficult to get out of the tube.  But I'm okay with that. This is an expensive product so I don't want to use more than I need to.  What I use is several pinhead size dots on the back of my hand.  I then rub it in.  The Retinol leaves my hand feeling soft and I've experienced no irritation.

*One of the things you absolutely need to do is wear sunscreen.  Even in the winter I've been using sunscreen on that hand as Retinol makes skin photo-sensitive.

WRINKLES -- This is where I've been pleasantly surprised and kind of amazed.  The skin on the back of my hand looks and acts younger.  It has less of a papery, dry and thin old-lady look and it definitely is showing fewer lines and wrinkles.  Even when I flex my skin in an effort to make wrinkles.

SUMMARY
I tested this on one hand so I could clearly see if there were changes.  The test hands now look different.  The one that has had the Retinol creme looks younger and all but one of the brown spots is almost impossible to see.  Can't wait to bring the other hand and my face up to speed.  From what I have seen, this product works.",04-01-2017,04-01-2017

The bags are starting and the smile crinkles are there when I don't smile. I resigned myself to reality and aging. I have used many good quality expensive creams and gels that feel good but don't seem to make any significant change.

BUT I started using the Retinol 0.5 alongside the Obagi Professional-C Peptide Complex about 5-6 weeks ago. And while I don't have before and after (I wish I did now) I can't get over the noticeable difference. I follow the directions and try to use the sparing amounts recommended. I was concerned the first week of use because immediately after application my skin really flushed and then I got areas on my check and around the eyes that started peeling (a thin layer). I stuck it out and now I have neither issue. I must say, my skin hasn't looked this smooth and even-toned in AGES.

I had my concerns as this is a skincare product normally sold under a dermatologist's care and observation. I really didn't have any problems and I am sold on the Obagi line. With these results, I feel good to say that I believe the product I received is legit. The cream's not especially unique in appearance and fragrance-- a normal moisturizer type texture that I take care to spread out with 2-3 pumps of eraser-sized dollops.

Like other products form this line, this one is also loaded with too many chemicals and too little natural ingredients.  Retinol is a form of vitamin A and it gradually refines skin texture while effectively minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Some people are sensitive to retinol and can experience acne breakout.  Obagis Retinol features retinol entrapment technology which makes it effective yet minimally irritating. Ingredients: water (aqua), caprylic/capric triglyceride, glyceryl stearate, cyclopentasiloxane, butylene glycol, stearic acid, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, polysorbate 60, stearyl alcohol, glycerin, retinol, polysorbate 20, dimethicone, carthamus tinctorius (safflower oil) - safflower oil contains lubricant properties that prompt the skin to retain water and moisture. The oil consists primarily of linoleic acid, an omega-6 that is packed with essential vitamins. Safflower oil prevents dryness and roughness and removes dirt and oil. Its content makes safflower oil a key treatment for issues including eczema, psoriasis and acne. Its hydrating properties lend skin a healthy glow, promote elasticity and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.

Even Retinol cant perform the miracles a plastic surgeon can, so its silly to image some magic formula for an affordable price. And by now, any woman past her youth is aware of the benefits of Retinol treatment.

Taking into account the amount of time and expense put into a lifetime of skincare, the results of a product like the Obagi360 are relative to age, type of skin and regularity of use. To that end, the product I received was commensurate with my expectations, acceptable, but no remarkable. I received this product through the Amazon Vine program and admittedly would not have paid the full purchase amount simply because I would never purchase skincare items without being able to sample the quality and texture. Im not disappointed, but unless I see significant results soon, I probably won't keep using this product. It is especially concerning now that I am reading some reviews that are very unsatisfied with this item.

This product seemed to be in the retinol range that was about right for me, so I was interested in trying it, and I have been using it nightly for about three weeks now--perhaps not yet enough time to see major changes, but I wanted to provide at least a preliminary review.

The good news is that I have not experienced any skin problems related to this product.  I know that retinol can cause breakouts, and I was concerned about this, especially given that I can be prone to acne, but I have not had this issue at all, so I was pleased.  In terms of improvement in my skin's appearance, I haven't noticed anything major.  It does seem like on the mornings after I use the product, my skin has a slightly more ""tight"" appearance--i.e., drier, less oily than usual.  But otherwise, I will need to continue l using the product for long to see whether I experience more significant benefits.

The major downside to this product is the packaging.  It comes in a small squeeze tube with a pull-off cap. To dispense the produce, you must squeeze the tube, and there is a TINY hole at the top which releases the product.  This process is VERY difficult, and it has only become harder as I have used the product.  This past past week, when I was squeezing the tube, the entire top popped off, and the product splattered all over.  (Note:  this has happened to other reviewers as well.)  The tube wasn't very fully to begin with, so it is disappointing to lose product in this manner.  Plus, the top will NOT pop back on, so now I have to reach into the exposed tube itself to use the product, which isn't particularly sanitary.

Based on my knowledge so far, I would be hesitant to recommend this product.  However, I will keep using it and will report back if I see improved results.",02-15-2017,02-15-2017

I've been blessed with ""good"" skin but have begun noticing some deeper lines around my mouth and between my eyebrows so that's where I'm focusing right now.  I do think I see some slight improvement which makes me very happy. I'm not looking for miracles, just improvement.  Yes, it's pricey but no prescription needed, and the tube should last me quite a while.

I wish it was fragrance free because I'm quite sensitive to smells, but thankfully the scent dissipates after a short while.  It definitely appears to be the actual product and not fake as some reviewers have mentioned.  Honestly, I don't know how the tube could be emptied and refilled anyway.  Yes, there are quite a few chemicals in this, and I am careful not to overload my skin with artificial ingredients, but I'll continue to use this if I see results.

UPDATE  03/04/17:
Well, I cannot use this.  After applying nightly for probably two weeks (per directions), suddenly I broke out in burning, red, dry skin where I applied it between my eyebrows.  Researched retinol and discovered mostly recommended to apply every few days to build up for sensitive skin.  Redness has not subsided after 4 days.

I've been using this about two weeks. I'm definitely noticing fewer lines around my eyes and mouth, and the difference on my forehead is striking.

However - in the past I've had trouble with retinol products because of my very sensitive skin. I have eczema and retinol can cause that to flare up. But with this being a lighter strength, I thought I'd try it anyway.  The first few days I applied as directed, also being very careful to make sure I moisturized well on my more eczema-prone areas. After four days, I stopped using the retinol around my mouth and eyes as these areas where the skin is already thin were starting to redden.  After a few days, the redness went away, so I tried again, but only applying it every other day. This seems to work well so far, I'm still seeing reduction in thin lines but the redness has not returned after a week.

So my verdict is, if you've tried retinol in the past and had trouble, this might work for you.  Take it slow and watch your face closely for changes, both the good and bad ones, and be prepared to adjust your routine. I'm very pleased with how it's working.",02-08-2017,02-08-2017

However, I used Retimax, which is another Obagi Retin A product.  I had an Obagi peel a year and a half ago and the results were okay, however my most prominent spots have returned.  A nurse a procedure on my arms recommended this product.  I used it for a week or two and then having just purchased a Clarisonic Fit, I cleaned my face using the new device.  I noticed that right away I turned bright red in the main regions that I use Retin A, which is cheeks and around my mouth.  I told my self to remember NOT to do that again.  Then, two weeks later, I did it again.  Really hot and inflamed around the mouth and I stopped as soon as I remembered the pain.  About a week later I thought I noticed discoloration around that area.  Not red but a grayish color.  I went back to the nurse and showed her and she said that I should not have used the ""brush"" where I was using Obagi.  Well, that has been two months now and I still have this gray, awful discoloration.  I have used all of the whitening creams and nothing is helping.  The moral to this story is to realize that your skin before Obagi is not the skin ""after Obagi""!  I am now using LED light daily and a LOT of makeup.  I had no idea that this kind of trauma could occur but, well....be careful out there.  Obagi should not be used without an overseer.  It is strong stuff.",12-27-2016,12-27-2016

All i can say it did for me was adorn my face with a few blemishes, just fantastic. i am aware of the ""retinol uglies"" sometimes your skin gets worse before better due to elimination of toxins and skin adjusting... etc. i wanted to give this product a fair chance so after a week i didn't use for a few days...to pick it back up for another weeks use. Yep more blemishes came out to play that i hadnt noticed taking the few days break that i did. i decided to throw in the towel.... really cant see results being worth this mess. also the smell is gross as well, kind of like a bad elmers glue. i can handle that however since it went away once rubbed in completely. note: im not typically acne prone unless im really stressed or forget to take off makeup at night. sadly, I will not be buying this again.",12-30-2015,12-30-2015

It appears to be doing what it claims. However, I wish I'd read up on retinol in more detail before I started using it because I would have done things differently.  It is suggested that if you're new to using retinol, to start by using it every third night and work up to every other night. I used it 3 nights in a row when I started. But by the 4th day my face was blotchy, dry & peeling like sunburn. And don't think that this means there is fresh-looking skin underneath. There was just more dry skin.

Also, it must be used on completely dry skin....there's some kind of reaction that takes place when there's water on the skin (probably the sunburn-like reaction above).

I also read that new users can ""buffer"" the retinol by mixing it with moisturizer. The dryness was almost unbearable to me.  During weeks 2 & 3, I waited awhile then put on some face cream. My skin was still terribly dry but it felt better. Then there was the constant flakiness. At first it seemed that the flakes didn't want to come off at all. Don't make the same mistake I did by rubbing too hard with a washcloth...looked like I had an abrasion.

I just finished my 4th week and the flakes seem to come off much easier and it no longer looks flaky, just kind of dry. Surprisingly, the area under my eyes looked the worst at first but haven't been bad for a couple of weeks. The most troublesome spot has been on my cheeks right next to my mouth and chin.

Based on everything I read, it might take a few months for the skin to adapt to the retinol before revealing fresh, shiny skin. So I have a ways to go. This is also the time when most folks give up due to the dryness/flakiness but it's best to stick it out and continue using the product.

I'll try to remember to add an update in another month. Hopefully I'll continue to see improvement.",02-17-2015,02-17-2015

When I finished the tube, I decided to try this one. It is a nice cream, so I don't feel the need to moisturize at night anymore. For those who use Retin products regularly, it is smooth, works as a retinol product, and the tube makes applying the correct amount easy.
For those who have not used a retinol, it is very drying to new users. The retinol will make you peel and sensitive to sunburning. The peeling stops when your skin accumates to the faster growing of cells.
I have food allergies, which causes me to break out in cystic acne. I cannot always identify what causes the problem. My routine for clear skin: I wash my face with a sensitive skin soap and cotton pads twice to three times a day. I use a benzoyl peroxide 10% in the morning, wait five minutes, and then apply Cerave day cream. I use the Retin A cream at night. I wash my face, pat dry, and wait at least five minutes before applying the retin A.

I found that this product felt fine going on, and it did help some with the lines. However, it didn't actually reverse any of the aging effects on my face. It only works if you are continually using it daily.

The product does not smell funny, which is important to me. It feels nice going on, and it doesn't tingle or burn at all. It does start helping with the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles within a couple of days. The only problem I have with the product is that you cannot stop using it when you start without age lines starting to show again. It is fairly expensive, and for me, it is too expensive to buy it over and over again.

Pros:
* It works to minimize fine lines and wrinkles
* No offensive odor

Cons:
* Cost
* Requires continuous use",07-21-2018,07-21-2018
